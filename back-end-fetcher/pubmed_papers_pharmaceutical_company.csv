40390052,Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on continuity of medical treatment for patients with chronic diseases in Japan: a retrospective cohort analysis.,,BMC health services research,10.1186/s12913-025-12798-3,"The COVID-19 pandemic has raised concerns about continuity of care for chronic diseases such as diabetes, hypertension, and dyslipidemia. Although studies have documented declines in healthcare utilization, few have assessed individual-level patterns of treatment interruption. We conducted a retrospective cohort analysis using administrative claims data (2018-2021) from a Prefecture, Japan. Eligible patients were diagnosed with and prescribed medications for diabetes mellitus, hypertension, or dyslipidemia in January of 2019 or 2020 and followed until December of each year. The primary outcome was the time-to- interruption of physician visits, defined as a gap of at least 60 days between follow-up visits. We used Cox proportional hazards regression, adjusted for age, sex, comorbidities, and prior healthcare utilization, to compare the risk of treatment interruption in 2020 (COVID-19 group) vs. 2019 (pre-pandemic group). Sensitivity analyses were performed with thresholds of 30 and 90 days. Logistic regression examined whether pandemic-related interruptions were associated with the likelihood of returning to treatment within one year. A total of 410,911 patients met the inclusion criteria. Across all three chronic conditions, the hazard of interruption was significantly higher in 2020 than in 2019; adjusted HRs are 1.26 (95% CI = 1.17-1.36) for diabetes, 1.39 (95%CI = 1.31-1.47) for hypertension, and 1.24 (95%CI = 1.17-1.32) for dyslipidemia, respectively. No significant difference in resuming care was observed between the 2020 and 2019 interruptions (OR = 0.89; 95% CI = 0.81-1.09). Sensitivity analyses showed consistent findings, despite slight variations in hazard ratios for different gap thresholds. The COVID-19 pandemic was associated with an increased risk of treatment interruption in patients with chronic diseases, underscoring the need for targeted strategies to maintain care continuity during public health emergencies. While older patients and those with multimorbidity showed earlier interruptions, the overall patterns persisted across disease groups, emphasizing the importance of preemptive measures and patient outreach to prevent delayed or forgone care.",,,tomoki.ishikawa@ihep.jp.
40389817,Clinical utility of dynamic chest radiography as an auxiliary tool for atrial fibrillation detection in heart failure: a pilot study.,,BMC cardiovascular disorders,10.1186/s12872-025-04820-7,"Dynamic chest radiography (DCR) can estimate haemodynamic parameters in patients with heart failure (HF). Atrial fibrillation (AF) often coexists with HF; however, owing to its sometimes paroxysmal nature and minimal or absent symptoms, many patients with AF remain undiagnosed. Additional tools for AF diagnosis may be beneficial; therefore, we evaluated the ability of DCR to distinguish patients with HF in sinus rhythm (SR) from those with AF. In this small-sample pilot study, 20 patients with HF (median age, 67 years; males, 85%) underwent 12-lead electrocardiography and DCR on the same day. Aortic arch (Ao), right atrial (RA), right and left pulmonary artery (PA), and left ventricular (LV) apex pixel values (PVs) were measured. Seventeen patients were in SR and three demonstrated AF on 12-lead electrocardiography before DCR. The PV and PV change rate waveforms of the Ao, RA, PAs, and LV apex were regular in SR and irregular with AF. The difference between patients in SR and those with AF was particularly clear in the LV apex PV change rate waveforms. In addition, the heart rates (HRs) of patients in SR and with AF could be calculated from the PV change rate waveforms and were similar to those calculated by 12-lead electrocardiography. DCR can detect AF in patients with HF and may be able to infer HR.",,,hiraiwa.hiroaki.v0@f.mail.nagoya-u.ac.jp.

40389316,Modelling diabetes and depression in Pakistan: using economic modelling to inform intervention design and a clinical trial of a behavioural activation intervention.,2025-05-19,BMJ open,10.1136/bmjopen-2024-092158,"The 'Developing and evaluating an adapted behavioural activation intervention for depression and diabetes in South Asia (DiaDeM)' trial investigates a psychological intervention, behavioural activation (BA), on people with both diabetes and depression in Bangladesh and Pakistan. This study aimed to aid the intervention and trial design. This was a modelling study using microsimulation to assess the intervention's cost-effectiveness. Diabetes was modelled using the UK Prospective Diabetes Study model based on Pakistani patients and depression was modelled using Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) trajectories allowing for multiple depressive episodes. It was assumed that diabetes-related adverse events increased depression recurrence, while depression impacted haemoglobin A1c, increasing diabetes-related events. The model estimated (1) maximum cost of BA which would be cost-effective (headroom analysis) to inform intervention design, and (2) value of reducing uncertainty around different measures (value of information analysis) to prioritise data collection in the DiaDeM study. Analysis was conducted from a Pakistani healthcare perspective over a lifetime with costs and outcomes discounted at 3%. BA plus usual care was compared against usual care. BA involved six sessions by a trained (non-mental health) facilitator. The usual care comparator was the prevailing mix of pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatments used in Pakistan. The primary outcome was disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs). Secondary outcomes included life years, healthcare costs and the rate of depression and diabetes-related events. Over their lifetime, individuals receiving BA plus usual care avoid 3.2 (95% credible interval: 2.7 to 3.8) years of mild depression and experience fewer diabetes-related events. BA plus usual care resulted in an additional 0.27 (0.03 to 0.52) life years, 0.98 (0.45 to 1.86) DALYs averted and had incremental healthcare costs of -US$97 (-US$517 to US$142), excluding BA costs. The maximum cost per BA course at which was cost-effective is US$83 (US$9 to US$214). Value of information analysis found the most important measures to include in the trial are the impact of depression on diabetes and PHQ-9 over time. This is the first model to jointly model depression and diabetes for South Asia and uses novel methods to reflect the diseases and inform intervention and trial design. This evidence has helped to inform the design of the DiaDeM intervention and the trial to evaluate it.

Microbiological expertise, insight, and cGMP input for new product development is needed for formulation, manufacturing, packaging and monitoring, plus testing of in-process materials, finished dosage form and stability. Risk assessment and evaluation of potential microbial contamination origin(s) support a phase-appropriate, broad end-to-end analytical approach to microbiological contamination control strategy. The ultimate beneficiary of this robust oversight and management of quality is the patient. Using knowledge and risk assessment along with experience (of non-sterile and sterile drug product development) provide for a balanced approach to microbiological quality in medicines.

40389107,Uptitration of sacubitril/valsartan in acute heart failure: Insight from the PREMIER study.,,Journal of cardiac failure,10.1016/j.cardfail.2025.05.001,"This study investigated the effect of uptitration in sacubitril/valsartan (Sac/Val) compared with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers (ACEI/ARB) on N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) level within current guideline-directed medical therapy in acute heart failure (AHF). This was the secondary analysis in the Program Angiotensin-Neprilysin Inhibition in Admitted Patients with Worsening Heart Failure (PREMIER) study. AHF patients were allocated to switch to Sac/Val or ACEI/ARB, and Sac/Val group was divided into Sac/Val with or without uptitration group (Sac/Val >24/26 mg or ≤24/26 mg twice daily at week 8). The primary endpoint was the proportional change in geometric means of NT-proBNP levels at week 8. A total of 376 patients were included, consistent with the primary analysis in PREMIER. The percent changes in NT-pro BNP level were -51% (Sac/Val with uptitration), -39% (Sac/Val without uptitration), and -32% (ACEI/ARB), and their group ratio adjusted for baseline characteristics were 0.72 (Sac/Val with uptitration vs. ACEI/ARB, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.59 to 0.89; p=0.002) and 0.93 (Sac/Val without uptitration vs. ACEI/ARB, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.13; p=0.47). However, Sac/Val without uptitration group yielded a greater NT-proBNP reduction than ACEI/ARB group (adjusted ratio of change 0.72, 95% CI 0.55 to 0.94; p=0.016) in the subgroup of reduced ejection fraction. There were no adverse events associated with Sac/Val uptitration. Uptitration of Sac/Val therapy yielded a greater NT-proBNP level reduction in AHF patients, but Sac/Val therapy without uptitration also reduced NT-proBNP level in a subgroup with reduced ejection fraction compared with ACEI/ARB therapy.",,,tanakaa2@cc.saga-u.ac.jp.
40388741,Emergency visits for end-of-life patients receiving physician-led home care in Japan: A retrospective observational study.,2025-05-19,Medicine,10.1097/MD.0000000000042501,"To clarify the patterns, reasons, and patient characteristics associated with emergency visits in the final 30 days of life for patients receiving home care in Japan. We conducted a retrospective analysis of emergency visits made by home care physicians to patients who died while receiving home care in 2018. Data on patient characteristics and emergency visits during the final 30 days of life were extracted from medical records. Poisson regression analysis was used to identify factors associated with emergency visit frequency. Among 83 end-of-life patients (median age 84 years, 49.4% male), a total of 86 emergency visits were recorded. These visits occurred most frequently in the days immediately preceding death, with 40.7% occurring within 5 days before death. Visits were more common during afternoons (37.2%) and weekends (39.6%). The primary reasons for visits included respiratory distress (20.9%), clinical assessment (14.0%), and neurological symptoms (12.8%). While some visits resulted in medication prescriptions (26.7%) or laboratory tests (22.1%), 36.1% involved observation only. Multivariable analysis revealed that longer duration of home care was associated with increased emergency visit frequency (31-365 days: relative risk [RR] 2.30, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.16-4.54; >365 days: RR 3.00, 95% CI: 1.56-5.78), while younger age was associated with increased visits (≤79 years: RR 2.04, 95% CI: 1.19-3.47). Emergency home visits in the terminal phase often clustered near death and frequently resulted in observation only, suggesting that some visits may be driven more by caregiver anxiety than medical urgency. Additionally, care level appeared to play a limited role during this period. These findings highlight the need for proactive symptom management, caregiver support, and scalable approaches such as telehealth to optimize end-of-life care.",Kosaka M; Miyatake H; Arita S; Tsunetoshi C; Masunaga H; Ozaki A; Beniya H,Orange Home-Care Clinic,
40388703,Amylin and the amylin receptors in migraine: Is there another pathway to target?,2025-05-19,Cephalalgia : an international journal of headache,10.1177/03331024251340066,"Here, we review the available evidence implicating amylin in migraine, its relationship with calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) and its potential utility as a therapeutic target. The pathophysiology of migraine is currently better understood and the role of CGRP is key. Treatments targeting this pathway have been successful and migraine is a complex disorder, with so many molecules being implicated. Amylin, as for CGRP, is part of the calcitonin/CGRP peptide family. Some therapies intended to block the CGRP pathway can also target amylin receptors. Similar to CGRP, amylin can trigger migraine attacks in a provocation study. Amylin plasma levels have been highlighted as a potential migraine biomarker in one study in migraine patients. Moreover, some preclinical studies in rodents have also discussed sex differences. Comprehending the distinct and overlapping mechanisms between amylin and CGRP signalling could develop further our understanding of migraine pathophysiology. In summary, this review reveals, through initial studies, that targeting the amylin pathway may have a potential role as a novel treatment option for those who may not respond to other treatments, or as a better alternative.",,,
40388610,Framework to identify innovative sources of value creation from platform technologies.,2025-05-19,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,10.1073/pnas.2424665122,"Platform technologies are fundamentally reshaping the pharmaceutical industry, offering unprecedented potential for innovation across multiple therapeutic areas. However, traditional valuation models, focused on single-asset metrics, struggle to capture the full spectrum of value these technologies create. This paper presents a comprehensive framework for evaluating the innovative sources of value creation enabled by platform technologies throughout the drug development lifecycle. Through a systematic literature review, in-depth case studies, and framework development, we provide a structured methodology for capturing the diverse benefits of these technologies. Our findings reveal that platform technologies generate value across strategic, technical, and adaptive dimensions, requiring a multifaceted valuation approach. The proposed Platform Value Identification across Strategic, Technical, and Adaptive domains Framework defines key value drivers, specifies quantitative assessment metrics, and provides implementation guidance to inform strategic decision-making in research and development investment, portfolio management, and business development. Application of the framework to case studies of Alnylam's RNAi platform, Genentech's therapeutic antibody platform, and Moderna's mRNA platform demonstrates its broad utility and impact potential. By adopting this holistic, data-driven approach, stakeholders can better assess the long-term value and competitive advantages of well-implemented platform technologies, accelerating the development of transformative therapies for patients.",Jones CH; Beitelshees M; Hill A; Griffiths D; Murphy M; Kapadia K; Dolsten M; True JM,Bulmore Consulting; Clearview Healthcare Partners; Pfizer,
40388415,R&D investment and total factor productivity in China's pharmaceutical industry: The moderating effect of the centralized procurement policy.,2025-05-19,PloS one,10.1371/journal.pone.0324519,"We use the implementation of China's centralized procurement policy as a quasi-natural experiment to examine the effects of China's centralized procurement policy on pharmaceutical research and development (R&D) investment and total factor productivity (TFP). Empirical findings demonstrate that the positive impact of R&D investment on TFP has a delayed effect in the pharmaceutical sector. The centralized procurement policy shortens this lagged effect by imposing survival pressure and pushing companies to enhance their R&D investment intensity significantly. From the heterogeneity perspective, for companies facing significant financing constraints, the centralized procurement policy significantly enhances the intensity of R&D investment. In contrast, for companies with weaker finance limitations, the impact of the policy on their R&D investment intensity is insignificant. Still, the positive moderating effect of the policy on the relationship between R&D investment and TFP is more pronounced. Based on the findings, policymakers need to take a long-term view and consider the diversified influence of different enterprises. Policies that reduce financing constraints and create an enabling environment for sustained R&D are important and complementary.",,,
40388089,"Conjunctivitis in Adults with Atopic Dermatitis Treated with Dupilumab: An Observational Study of Clinical Characteristics, Symptomatology, and Treatment.",,Advances in therapy,10.1007/s12325-025-03209-4,"Conjunctivitis is more prevalent in patients with atopic dermatitis (AD) than the general population, and is the most common adverse event during dupilumab treatment for AD. We aimed to characterize conjunctivitis diagnosed during AD dupilumab treatment and to assess effectiveness of ophthalmic treatments. This prospective observational study enrolled adults with AD who received the approved dupilumab regimen in a real-world setting for at least 8 weeks prior to enrollment. At baseline, we compared ophthalmic signs and symptoms in two cohorts of patients who had received dupilumab for similar duration: one with conjunctivitis (group 1) and one with no conjunctivitis (group 2). All patients continued treatment with dupilumab, and group 1 patients received treatment for conjunctivitis at the discretion of the investigator. We assessed effectiveness of prescribed treatments and the outcomes of conjunctivitis up to Week 60. All analyses were descriptive. A total of 35 patients were assessed in group 1 and 11 in group 2. Mean AD duration was 22.9 ± 15.2 years (group 1) and 13.1 ± 16.9 years (group 2). In group 1, 91% of patients reported a history of facial lesions during AD flares and 54% had current AD facial lesions, compared with 64% and 9%, respectively, in group 2. Ongoing facial contact dermatitis and rosacea were only reported in group 1 (11% and 9%, respectively). Common physical findings at baseline in group 1 compared with group 2 included periocular eczematous rash (65% vs. 18%) and/or lichenification (47% vs. 27%), posterior blepharitis with meibomian gland dysfunction (83% vs. 55%), bulbar hyperemia (89% vs. 46%) and conjunctival papillary pattern (69% vs. 27%); 24% of patients in group 1 and none in group 2 had corneal neovascularization, mostly in a single peripheral quadrant. There was no evidence of tear volume insufficiency. One patient in group 1 (3%) and two in group 2 (18%) had eyelash mites. Three patients (9%) in group 1 and one in group 2 (9%) had Staphylococcus aureus-positive conjunctival swabs. Most patients (88%) received multiple ophthalmic treatments for the qualifying conjunctivitis event. Investigators assessed topical corticosteroids and topical calcineurin inhibitors administered either as eye drops or ointment as the most effective treatments. Most conjunctivitis events recovered/resolved (84%) or were resolving/recovering (12%) at study end. Mean ± SD time to recovery from the initial visit was 171.9 ± 54.6 days. No participants discontinued treatment with dupilumab. Prolonged history of AD and facial and/or eyelid AD lesions increased the likelihood of a conjunctivitis diagnosis during AD dupilumab treatment. Treatment of conjunctivitis with topical corticosteroids and/or calcineurin inhibitors resolved or controlled the event in most patients without need to discontinue dupilumab. GOV: ClinicalTrial.gov Identifier: NCT04287608. Atopic dermatitis (AD) or eczema is an inflammatory disease with episodes of itchy skin rashes. Moderate-to-severe AD is not well controlled with common skin medications. Dupilumab is an advanced treatment approved for moderate-to-severe AD. Patients with AD are more likely to develop conjunctivitis (pink eye) than healthy people. Also, a conjunctivitis diagnosis is more likely during AD dupilumab treatment. We aimed to describe conjunctivitis in dupilumab-treated AD and summarize treatments prescribed by eye doctors, and their outcomes. We enrolled 35 patients with conjunctivitis affecting both eyes that developed while on dupilumab treatment (group 1). For comparison, we enrolled 11 patients without conjunctivitis while being treated with dupilumab for a similar duration (group 2). We found that group 1 patients had AD for longer and had AD rashes on the face and around eyes more often than group 2 patients. Eye examination showed inflammation of different eye parts in both groups, but more often in group 1 patients. There was no evidence for a unique type of dupilumab-related conjunctivitis. Conjunctivitis events were treated with combinations of common eye medications. Most conjunctivitis events recovered/resolved (84%) or were resolving/recovering (12%) at study end. In conclusion, a long history of AD and localization of AD to the face increased the likelihood of a conjunctivitis diagnosis during AD dupilumab treatment. Treatment with common anti-inflammatory eye drops or ointments was successful in most patients without needing to discontinue dupilumab. These results may help dermatologists recognize and manage conjunctivitis during dupilumab treatment for AD.",Akpek E; Chen Z; Lawless E; Van Spall M; Ozturk ZE; Shumel B,Sanofi; Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc.; Regeneron Ireland DAC; Johns Hopkins Medicine,brad.shumel@regeneron.com.
40388087,Macitentan and Tadalafil Combination Therapy in Patients with Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension and Cardiovascular Comorbidities: Real-World Evidence from OPUS and OrPHeUS.,,Advances in therapy,10.1007/s12325-025-03180-0,"Patients diagnosed with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) often present with risk factors associated with cardiovascular disease, including diabetes mellitus (DM), hypertension (HTN), and obesity. The 2022 ESC/ERS pulmonary hypertension treatment guidelines recommend initial monotherapy with an endothelin receptor antagonist (ERA) or phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitor (PDE5i) for patients with PAH and cardiopulmonary comorbidities, with treatment escalation to be considered on an individual basis. Data on safety, tolerability, and effectiveness of combination therapy in these patients are lacking. OPUS (prospective, observational drug registry) and OrPHeUS (retrospective, medical chart review) were multicenter US studies of patients newly initiating the ERA macitentan (2013-2020). Patients in the combined OPUS/OrPHeUS dataset with PAH receiving combination therapy with macitentan and the PDE5i tadalafil were identified. Descriptive analyses were performed for patients with ≥ 1 of DM/HTN/obesity and those without these comorbidities. In OPUS/OrPHeUS, 1336 patients with PAH received macitentan plus tadalafil during the observation period. Of these, 820 (61.4%) had ≥ 1 of DM/HTN/obesity and 516 (38.6%) had none of these comorbidities at or before enrollment. Median (Q1, Q3) exposure to macitentan and tadalafil combination therapy was similar at 13.7 (3.5, 28.0) and 14.8 (5.4, 27.4) months, respectively. For patients with ≥ 1 of DM/HTN/obesity versus those without, 1-year Kaplan-Meier estimates (95% confidence limits) for survival were 92.3% (89.9, 94.1) and 91.9% (88.8, 94.1), for patients free from hospitalization were 63.6% (59.6, 67.2) and 60.0% (55.1, 64.5), and for patients persisting on combination therapy were 66.5% (63.1, 69.8) and 68.5% (64.1, 72.4). Adverse events (AE; OPUS only) were reported in 78.4% and 80.0%, respectively, with no unexpected AEs observed. There was a trend towards higher AE incidence with increasing comorbidity number and in patients with cardiovascular comorbidities who were treatment-naïve. Patients with PAH and ≥ 1 of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, or obesity treated with macitentan and tadalafil combination therapy had similar hospitalization, survival, and safety profiles as those without these comorbidities, though patients with comorbidities initiated on combination therapy and those with multiple comorbidities may require closer monitoring. These real-world data suggest that combination therapy may be considered for patients with PAH and cardiovascular comorbidities. OPsumit gov/. Patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) often have other conditions affecting their heart or blood vessels, known as cardiovascular comorbidities. It is recommended that patients with PAH and cardiovascular comorbidities start with one PAH medication and later add another, if possible. However, there is limited information on the safety and effectiveness of combining two PAH medications in these patients. The OPUS and OrPHeUS studies collected information on patients with PAH treated in United States clinics between 2013 and 2020. We identified patients who were treated with two PAH medications, macitentan and tadalafil (referred to as combination therapy). We grouped them into patients with cardiovascular comorbidities (any medical history of diabetes mellitus, hypertension or obesity; 820 patients) and patients without these conditions (516 patients) and looked at how they did over time. Both groups were treated with combination therapy for approximately 14–15 months. After 1 year, outcomes were similar for patients with and without cardiovascular comorbidities: survival for both groups was 92%; 64% and 60% of patients remained hospitalization-free; and 67% and 69% remained on combination therapy. Side effects were consistent with those expected for these medications, with generally more side effects seen in patients with more comorbidities and in those new to PAH medications. Patients with PAH and cardiovascular comorbidities treated with macitentan and tadalafil combination therapy had similar results as those without cardiovascular comorbidities. This suggests that combination therapy may be used in select patients with PAH and cardiovascular comorbidities, although those who have more comorbidities or are new to PAH treatment may need closer observation.",Ong R; MacDonald G; Martin N; Senatore A,Statistical Decision Science; Global Medical Affairs; Global Epidemiology,Kimh33kim@health.ucsd.edu.

Information regarding treatment status for GPP and treatment patterns for flares is important but limited as a result of the rarity of the condition. We conducted a 10-year, retrospective, longitudinal chart review of treatment patterns at GPP referral hospitals in Japan. Eligible patients with GPP had at least 6 months of continuous observation data within 10 years after the date of protocol approval. Data were collected from patient records and annual patient reports. Patient characteristics and treatment details, including in relation to flare occurrence, were analyzed. The median age of patients (N = 205) was 53 years; 48.3% were female and most had mild or moderate GPP (66.8%). Patients commonly received nonbiologic systemic therapy (86.3%) and a similar proportion received biologics (79.5%); 95.1% received topical treatment and 22.4% received systemic adrenal corticosteroids. Use of nonbiologic systemic therapy decreased, and use of biologics increased, over the study period. During the observation period, the proportion of patients receiving biologic therapy increased after a flare (from 41.4% receiving biologics when flares occurred to 62.9% initiating a new biologic post flare). In Japanese clinical practice, the evolution of treatment practices for GPP has seen an increased use of biologic therapies over time. Biologic use was common after flares; however, some flares occurred during biologic therapy, indicating a need for improved treatment options to maintain stable disease and prevent flares.",Sakamoto W; Saitoh M; ,; Nippon Boehringer Ingelheim,yukari-o@tokyo-med.ac.jp.

Consequently, cancer support groups have a crucial role in guiding patients through their cancer journey and improving their quality of life. However, in Egypt, patient support groups remain undervalued and lack comprehensive visibility. This study aimed to address this gap by mapping patient online support groups in Egypt, categorizing them, and highlighting their importance in supporting patients and caregivers. The research includes examining online support groups and pages, particularly on Facebook. The results of our investigation indicate that 21% of the Facebook groups examined met the criteria for classification as qualified, another 21% were categorized as semi-qualified, while most of the groups, comprising 58%, were considered non-qualified. For the Facebook pages examined, organizational involvement through governmental, non-governmental, and charitable institutions qualified these pages as meeting the criteria for qualification. In contrast, the majority (70%) of the analyzed community pages were non-qualified, 30% were semi-qualified, and none met the criteria for qualification. This underscores the need for discernment when engaging with online resources. Furthermore, the study illuminates the role of various organizations, including hospitals, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and pharmaceutical companies, in supporting cancer patients, especially through online support groups. Despite these efforts, comprehensive review articles on Egyptian patient support groups are lacking, making this study a significant contribution to understanding and enhancing patient support in the fight against cancer.",Hassan Y,AstraZeneca,emad.shash@nci.cu.edu.eg.

Using a retrospective cohort of subjects with an MCI diagnosis at study entry and at least two follow-up visits between 2005 and December 2022, we developed a functional multistate model framework to estimate longitudinal patterns of transition probabilities between different cognitive states. The probability of reversion increased from 2% at baseline to a maximum of 8% by year 10 before gradual decline thereafter. For post-reversion, the probability of progression to MCI rose from 8% to 35.71% at Year 10 and subsequently stabilized. The instantaneous risk of MCI progressing was similar to the risk of re-progression to MCI for post-reversion. Post-reversion subjects remained at an increased risk of cognitive deterioration. The instantaneous risk of MCI progressing to AD is similar to the risk of re-progression to MCI for post-reversion. The FMSM we developed effectively utilizes multiple longitudinal markers to reveal variable transition patterns between different cognitive states. Considering both spatiotemporal dimensions and sparse irregularities from longitudinal neuroimaging and neuropsychological scales, fMLFPCA and MVFPCA help to extract variation patterns, to capture detailed changes characterizing the multidimensional evolution patterns of MCI.",,,

However, their effect on clinical outcomes has yet to be fully elucidated. In this study, we investigated the impact of irAEs, particularly pneumonitis, on clinical outcomes in patients receiving combined immunotherapy and chemotherapy for NSCLC. We retrospectively enrolled 850 patients with programmed cell death ligand-1 (PD-L1) 1-49% advanced NSCLC who were treated with chemotherapy alone or with combined immunotherapy and chemotherapy as first-line treatment at 19 different institutions in Japan between March 2017 and June 2022. Using data from their medical records, we examined the type and severity of irAEs and their association with clinical outcomes, including overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS). OS and PFS were not significantly different between patients with and without severe irAEs. However, in the group receiving combined immunotherapy and chemotherapy, those who developed pneumonitis within 42 days of treatment initiation had shorter OS and PFS, irrespective of the pneumonitis grade, and a worse prognosis than those who received chemotherapy alone. Additionally, early-onset pneumonitis was more likely in patients aged >75 years, those with high lactate dehydrogenase levels, and those receiving steroids or immunosuppressants, suggesting that these factors may contribute to the risk of early-onset pneumonitis. Early-onset pneumonitis is a poor prognostic factor in patients with PD-L1 1-49% advanced NSCLC receiving combined immunotherapy and chemotherapy. Further large-scale observational studies are warranted to confirm these findings. Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC); severe immune-related adverse events (irAEs); pneumonitis.",,,

Data of patients who underwent elective LAR for rectal cancer between 2018 and 2022 were obtained from the National Clinical Database of Japan. Hospitals were categorized into high-, medium-, and low-volume groups. Each group was constituted to represent approximately one-third of all surgeries performed between 2018 and 2019. The standardized morbidity/mortality ratios (SMRs) of Clavien-Dindo grade ≥3 (CD ≥ 3) complications were the primary endpoint. The secondary endpoints included anastomotic leakage, pneumonia, and surgical mortality. This study analyzed 91 800 cases of elective LAR, with 10.5% experiencing CD ≥ 3 complications, 8.8% anastomotic leakage, 0.9% pneumonia, and 0.5% surgical mortality. Despite COVID-19, SMRs of CD ≥ 3 complications decreased from 2018 to 2022 across all groups. However, increases in the rates and SMRs of CD ≥ 3 complications were observed in low-volume hospitals around mid-2020, followed by a decline. Anastomotic leakage showed similar trends. The rates and SMRs of pneumonia and surgical mortality remained unchanged. Notably, anastomotic leakage rates were 7.6%, 8.9%, and 10.0% in high-, medium-, and low-volume hospitals, respectively, indicating superior outcomes in high-volume hospitals. Early COVID-19 waves may have disproportionately affected low-volume hospitals. However, the decline in SMRs of CD ≥ 3 complications from 2018 to 2022 across all three groups suggests the robustness and resilience of surgical services for rectal cancer in Japan.

After searching CENTRAL, PubMed, and ICHUSHI-Web in July 2024, we included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing advanced dressings and standard dressings for surgical wounds in gastrointestinal surgery (PROSPERO No. CRD42024569084). Three authors independently screened the RCTs. We assessed the risk of bias and certainty of the body of evidence for the extracted data. The primary outcome was superficial SSI, and the secondary outcomes were length of postoperative hospital stay, costs, and allergy. This study was partially supported by the JSSI. A total of seven RCTs and 927 patients were included. The use of advanced dressings significantly lowered the risk of SSI compared to that associated with standard dressings (risk ratio: 0.54, 95% confidence intervals: 0.34-0.88). The certainty of the evidence was rated as moderate. According to the subgroup analysis, advanced dressings reduced the risk of SSI in colorectal surgery. Advanced dressings did not reduce the length of postoperative hospital stay or costs compared to that of standard dressings.

While systemic (pharmacological) therapy is currently established as the 'standard of care', effective local ulcer management remains crucial for all cases of DUs. This is particularly true for patients who cannot tolerate systemic treatments or in the case of refractory SSc-DUs. On this background, there is a pressing demand for the formulation of evidence-based guidelines to assist clinicians and patients in navigating the local treatment options for DUs. A steering committee of international experts was established by the World Scleorderma Foundation (WSF) Digital Ulcer (DU) ad hoc committee. Two systematic literature reviews on local non-surgical and surgical treatments for the management of SSc-DUs were performed to inform the development of local treatment recommendations for SSc-DUs. Consensus methodology was used to develop the final treatment recommendations. Six overarching treatment principles and eight local treatment recommendations (five non-surgical and three surgical) were agreed upon for the management of SSc-DU. Among topical non-surgical options, botulin toxin can be conditionally recommended for refractory and/or severe DUs. Among surgical treatments, autologous adipose tissue grafting might be recommended for DU healing when combined with background systemic treatments. These recommendations are specifically tailored to guide treatment decisions concerning both local and non-pharmacological approaches to managing SSc-related DUs.

The aim of the current study was to update this prior MAIC with more mature clinical data from both trials. The approach of the MAIC remained consistent with the previous study, with the exception of more mature data (28.4 months and 30.4 months of follow-up for elranatamab from MagnetisMM-3 (NCT04649359) and teclistamab from MajesTEC-1 (NCT03145181, NCT04557098), respectively). Individual patient-level data from MagnetisMM-3 (N = 116) were reweighted to match published aggregated data from MajesTEC-1. Variables included for adjustment were age (≥75 years), sex (for OS only), median time since diagnosis, International Staging System disease stage, high-risk cytogenetics, extramedullary disease, number of prior lines of therapy, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status, and penta-exposed/refractory status. An unanchored MAIC was conducted based on the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence Decision Support Unit 18 example code. A sensitivity analysis was conducted in which missing baseline characteristics data were imputed for elranatamab. In the base-case analysis, elranatamab was associated with significantly longer PFS (hazard ratio [HR] 0.55 [95% confidence intervals (CI): 0.37, 0.81], p < 0.05), OS (HR [95% CI]: 0.60 [0.40, 0.91], p < 0.05, and DoR 0.56 [0.31, 0.99] p < 0.05) compared with teclistamab. Results were largely consistent in the sensitivity analysis, except that the differences in OS were non-significant. A subgroup analysis of patients with a complete response or better was consistent with the base case.

CTs for the prevention/treatment of OM were identified using  Failed OM CTs were more likely to have academic sponsorship (45.7% vs. 39.1%), nonrandomized design (19.6% vs. 4.3%), and lower mean subject accrual (27.8 subjects vs. 101.4 subjects) compared to completed trials. The leading reason for termination was recruitment/enrollment (37.9%). Recruitment/enrollment and safety/efficacy accounted for failure in 84.6% of phase II trials. Contrary to general CTs where safety/efficacy concerns predominate, our results suggest OM-related trial failures are associated with a broader list of challenges including recruitment/enrollment, funding/sponsorship, and investigator/site issues. OM CTs demand aggressive planning, funding, and careful selection of trial sites and sponsorship to assure timely subject recruitment and reduce the risk for early termination and withdrawal.",,,

We present a post hoc analysis of Japanese participants. SOLAR is a randomized (2:1), open-label, multicenter, non-inferiority study of virologically suppressed participants switching to CAB+RPV LA Q2M (with or without oral lead-in) versus continuing BIC/FTC/TAF. The primary endpoint was HIV-1 RNA ≥50 copies/mL at Month 12 (Snapshot algorithm). Of 670 participants (modified intention-to-treat-exposed population), 20 were from Japan (LA, n=14; BIC/FTC/TAF, n=6).

Withdrawals were due to a non-drug-related adverse event (AE; acute hepatitis B) and a physician decision. Excluding injection site reactions, drug-related AE rates were higher in the LA group (36% vs 17%; all grade 1 or 2). No drug-related serious AEs were reported. Injection site reactions were common (100% [13/13] of LA participants); all were grade 1 or 2; none led to withdrawal; median duration was 4 days. Mean treatment satisfaction scores improved from baseline to Month 12 in the LA versus BIC/FTC/TAF Japanese groups (+6.25 vs +0.33 on a 66-point scale).

Since multiple organs may be involved in this disease, early treatment is required. In this regard, glucocorticoid (GC) therapy is often initiated before a definitive diagnosis is made. A biopsy of an injured organ is useful for a diagnosis but is not performed in all cases due to its invasiveness and, at times, diagnostic accuracy. Therefore, a comprehensive diagnosis is often made based on symptoms and clinical course of disease. However, it is sometimes difficult to distinguish EGPA from other hypereosinophilic diseases or vasculitides. In recent years, in addition to GC and immunosuppressive agents, anti-interleukin (IL)-5/IL-5 receptor alpha (IL-5Rα) antibodies targeting eosinophils have become increasingly important in the treatment of EGPA. However, accumulating data suggest that such anti-IL-5/IL-5Rα antibody therapy may have effects beyond those observed in eosinophils.

However, interindividual variability in clinical response to aripiprazole, possibly linked to its D2 partial agonism and D2 upregulation due to prior antipsychotics, has been reported. This study assessed whether there would be symptomatic aggravations or adverse events in clinically stable patients with schizophrenia when switching from oral antipsychotics to aripiprazole once-monthly (AOM), considering prior antipsychotics: oral aripiprazole (Group I) or other D2 antagonists (Group II). This was a 20-week, prospective, open-label, multicenter trial. Clinically stable patients with schizophrenia were assigned to two groups based on their oral antipsychotic medication and received AOM every 4 weeks. The primary endpoint was a change from baseline in the total Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) score. Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were monitored. Altogether, 100 patients in Group I and 101 in Group II completed the study.

Ganoderma lucidum is a common edible and medicinal mushroom, widely used as a functional food in Asia. This study investigated the potential anti-aging effects of Ganoderma lucidum extract (GLE). Our results demonstrated that GLE alleviated cellular oxidative stress, reduced the abnormal increase of mitochondrial ROS in aging cells, and maintained mitochondrial membrane integrity and inner membrane potential. Additionally, GLE affected mitochondrial biogenesis in aging cells. In a murine photoaging model, GLE treatment mitigated UVA-induced mitochondrial dysfunction while markedly attenuating UVA-triggered epidermal thickening and dermal protein depletion. These properties may be interrelated with the presence of abundant triterpenoids identified by LC-MS analysis.",,,zhysums@163.com.

Comprehensive data on tick abundance and the underlying ecological drivers are crucial for developing awareness and control strategies and to assess future changes in tick-borne disease risk. We aimed to provide a Germany-wide map of I. ricinus abundance to aid in disease transmission risk assessment. During 2018-2020, questing tick density was assessed at 83 sites across the whole country by drag flagging, whereby 49,344 I. ricinus nymphs and adults were collected. Relationships between climate, land cover, and monthly questing I. ricinus nymph density were explored and used to draw an abundance map. Highest tick hazard was observed in areas near the coast with mild winters and moist springs, and in mid-elevation mountain ranges, which represent popular tourist destinations. The ticks' seasonal activity pattern was predominantly unimodal. The fact that the observed regional differences are contradictory to a previous estimation based on a combination of regional studies illustrates the need for an extensive and coordinated sampling effort to reliably estimate tick abundance at larger spatial scales. Combined with data on tick-borne pathogens, our study enables estimating the density of infected ticks and consequently the risk of acquiring an infectious tick bite. Moreover, the observed relationships with climate and land cover can help to predict future developments of tick hazard under different climate scenarios in Central Europe.",Kämmer D; Bulling I; Kahl O,tick-radar GmbH,andrea.springer@tiho-hannover.de.

A longitudinal complete-case analysis of 714 children and adolescents (mean age: 11.2 years; 46.2% females) was conducted using data from the Brazilian High-Risk Cohort Study for Psychiatric Disorders in Childhood (BHRC). At baseline, parents/guardians completed the Family Environment Scale and the Brazilian SES Questionnaire. Three years after baseline, the same participants underwent brain magnetic resonance imaging, and the Child Behaviour Checklist (CBCL) was administered. Automated segmentation of the amygdala and hippocampus was performed using FreeSurfer v.5.1 software. Family conflict at baseline predicted internalising and externalising behaviours at follow-up. Evidence regarding the effects of family conflict and SES on brain structure and the moderating effects of family conflict on psychopathology and brain outcomes conditioned on SES was lacking. These results are consistent with emerging evidence that family conflict is a risk factor for externalising and internalising youth behaviour.

Societies worldwide felt the effects of the virus and pandemic related restrictive measures on their economies, healthcare systems, and social fabric. To curb the spread of COVID-19, numerous restrictive measures were implemented. This manuscript summarizes the findings published within the thematic series on Child Mental Health during the Covid-19 pandemic. Between May 2020 and June 2024 Child and Adolescent Psychiatry and Mental Health (CAPMH) issued a thematic series on ""Child Mental Health during the Covid-19 pandemic."" All manuscripts underwent a prescreening process by the Editor-in-Chief, including checks regarding the compliance with ethical standards compliance with the scope of the journal and the thematic series. Suitable manuscripts were then handled by one of the editors of the thematic series. All suitable manuscripts then underwent a peer review process that included at least two reviews. Different aspects of child and adolescent mental health as well as various aspects of the pandemic - in addition to their findings -were investigated, defined and discussed throughout the manuscripts within the series. A total of 327 manuscripts were submitted and 85 manuscripts were published within the series. Manuscripts included qualitative and quantitative studies as well as systematic reviews. The manuscripts reported findings from 22 countries from all over the world and various populations. The studies covered the somatic and psychological impacts of the pandemic, including emotional and behavioral consequences, non-suicidal self-injury and suicidal behavior, threat and trauma, parent child separation, school closure and home schooling, physical activity and media use, psychiatric care, as well as digital resources and online therapy. Through its findings, the research also highlighted the multilayered impact the pandemic had, as well as the need to make targeted interventions and evidence-based interventions available to a large audience. A broad range of literature in the series submitted from various countries around the world documented the profound impact of COVID-19 on child mental health. The findings can be used as a foundation for conceptualizing targeted programs to counteract the consequences, in addition to helping prepare systems in the event of similar incidents in the future.",,,Andreas.witt@upd.ch.
40379965,Psychiatric genome-wide association study enrichment shows promise for future psychopharmaceutical discoveries.,,Communications medicine,10.1038/s43856-025-00877-9,"Innovation in psychiatric therapeutics has stagnated on known mechanisms. Psychiatric genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified hundreds of genome-wide significant (GWS) loci that have rapidly advanced our understanding of disease etiology. However, whether these results can be leveraged to improve clinical treatment for specific psychiatric disorders remains poorly understood. In this proof-of-principal evaluation of GWAS clinical utility, we test whether the targets of drugs used to treat Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), Bipolar Disorder (BiP), Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD), Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), Schizophrenia (SCZ), Substance Use Disorders (SUDs), and insomnia (INS), are enriched for GWAS meta-analysis findings. The genes coding for treatment targets of medications used to SCZ, BiP, MDD, and SUDs (but not ADHD, PTSD, GAD, or INSOM) are enriched for GWS loci identified in their respective GWAS (ORs: 2.78-27.63; all ps <1.15e-3). Enrichment is largely driven by the presence of a GWS locus or loci within a gene coding for a drug target (i.e., proximity matching). Broadly, additional annotation (i.e., functional: Combined Annotation Dependent Depletion [CADD] scores, regulomeDB scores, eQTL, chromatin loop, and gene region; statistical: effect size of genome-wide significant SNPs; Z-score of SNPs; number of drug targets implicated by GWAS), with the exception of weighting by the largest SNP effect size, does not further improve enrichment across disorders. Evaluation of prior smaller GWAS reveal that more recent larger GWAS improve enrichment. GWAS results may assist in the prioritization of medications for future psychopharmaceutical research. To ensure the validity of genetic studies to discover new psychiatric treatments, we tested if large-scale genetic studies of psychiatric disorders could be used to rediscover existing psychiatric treatments. We found that by looking at results from genetic studies of schizophrenia, major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, and substance use disorders we were able to rediscover existing treatments. The best indicator of the genes that would predict potential new medications was the degree to which the genetic change was associated with the original disease. Our findings should enable improved discovery of possible targets for psychiatric treatments.",Huggett SB,Synapze LLC,ashatoum@wustl.edu.

This review traces the development of nonclinical QT evaluation, highlighting key milestones and innovations that have shaped current practices in cardiac safety assessment. The emergence of regulatory guidelines, including International Council for Harmonization of Technical Requirements for Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH) S7B, established a nonclinical framework for evaluating drug effects on cardiac repolarization, addressing concerns raised by drug withdrawals in the 1990s. Advances in in vitro, in vivo, and in silico models have enhanced the predictive accuracy of nonclinical studies, with the hERG assay and telemetry-based animal models becoming gold standards. Recent initiatives, such as the Comprehensive in vitro Proarrhythmia Assay (CiPA) and the Japan iPS Cardiac Safety Assessment (JiCSA), emphasize integrating mechanistic insights from human-derived cardiomyocyte models and computational approaches to refine risk predictions. The 2020s mark a shift toward integrated nonclinical-clinical risk assessments, as exemplified by the ICH E14/S7B Questions and Answers. These highlight the need of best practices for study design, data analysis, and interpretation to support regulatory decision-making. Furthermore, the adoption of New Approach Methodologies (NAMs) and reinforced adherence to 3Rs principles (Reduce, Refine, Replace) reflect a commitment to ethical and innovative safety science. This review underscores the importance of harmonized and translational approaches in cardiac safety evaluation, providing a foundation for advancing drug development while safeguarding patient safety. Future directions include further integration of advanced methodologies and regulatory harmonization to streamline nonclinical and clinical risk assessments.",Delpy E; Bétat AM; Delaunois A; Drieu la Rochelle C; Martel E; Valentin JP,Non-Clinical Department; Department of Drug Discovery Sciences-General Pharmacology; Early Clinical Development & Translational Science,eric.delpy@biotrial.com.

Evaluate factors associated with response to filgotinib over time. Patients from SELECTION (NCT02914522) receiving filgotinib 200 mg (FIL200) or 100 mg (FIL100), or placebo were included. Factors associated with partial Mayo Clinic Score (pMCS) were assessed post hoc using a mixed model for repeated measures (MMRM). The prognostic value of week 10 faecal calprotectin (FCP) was assessed versus week 58 outcomes; p values are nominal. The MMRM included 558 patients (FIL200, n = 199; FIL100, n = 172; placebo, n = 187). For filgotinib, factors associated with lower week 58 pMCS versus respective comparators (p < 0.05) included being biologic-naive, low baseline inflammatory burden (endoscopic subscore <3, C-reactive protein ≤3 mg/L), or week 10 histological remission, endoscopic subscore ≤1, rectal bleeding and stool frequency subscores of 0, Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire scores >170, and/or lower FCP concentration. The optimal prognostic week 10 FCP cut-off for a concurrent week 10 Mayo Clinic Score response was <250 µg/g; combined week 10 FCP <250 µg/g and pMCS remission had similar week 58 prognostic value for clinical remission as week 10 endoscopic response. Being biologic-naive, having low baseline inflammatory burden, or strong week 10 filgotinib responses were associated with lower pMCS over 1 year of treatment. FCP <250 µg/g and week 10 pMCS remission may reduce the need for follow-up endoscopy.",Jamoul C; Muller K; Taliadouros V; Oortwijn A,Biostatistics; Galapagos NV; Medical Affairs,edouard.louis@uliege.be.

This study evaluated the effectiveness of school-based interventions in preventing and reducing tobacco use among adolescents in LMICs. Seven databases were searched until 20 March 2024. The primary outcome was tobacco use prevalence (ever or point prevalence) at the longest follow-up. Risk of bias (RoB) was assessed, and random-effects meta-analyses were conducted, exploring heterogeneity via meta-regression (PROSPERO registration CRD42022330329). Twenty-seven studies (n=57,292) were summarised descriptively, and 20 were meta-analysed. Most studies were from Brazil (n=5, 18.5%), India (n=5, 18.5%), China (n=3, 11.1%), and Pakistan (n=2, 7.4%); twelve (44.4%) assessed newly developed and fifteen (55.6%) culturally adapted existing interventions; and over half (n=14, 51.9%) focused solely on preventing and reducing tobacco use while the rest addressed multiple behaviours. Overall, interventions reduced adolescent tobacco use (odds ratio [OR] 0.76, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.64-0.91; I²=47%; n=20; 50,056 participants). Stratification by outcome measure showed significant reductions in point prevalence (OR 0.69, 95% CI: 0.57-0.85; I²=32.4%). After adjusting for study duration, interventions with higher contact time had lower effectiveness than shorter interventions (adjusted OR 1.36, 95% CI: 1.01-1.84; p=0.045; I²=22%). Low RoB studies demonstrated lower odds of tobacco use among participants (OR 0.66, 95% CI: 0.50-0.87; I²=14%; n=6). School-based interventions in LMICs effectively reduce the proportion of adolescents who use tobacco. Shorter interventions appeared to be effective, suggesting that brief yet engaging interventions may offer practical advantages and could contribute to addressing the tobacco epidemic in LMICs. Further research is needed to determine optimal intervention duration and intensity for sustained effectiveness.",,,sahadat.hossain.21@ucl.ac.uk.

40377441,Response to a novel type II RAF inhibitor in diffuse leptomeningeal glioneuronal tumor with BRAF fusion.,2025-05-16,The oncologist,10.1093/oncolo/oyaf093,"Diffuse leptomeningeal glioneuronal tumor (DL-GNT) is a rare disease which is more often diagnosed in children and adolescents than adults. Activation of the MAPK/ERK pathway is implicated in the majority of cases, and BRAF fusions are the most common genetic alteration. BRAF fusions result in dimerization and constitutive downstream MAPK/ERK activity, against which type I RAF inhibitors have limited efficacy. Type II RAF inhibitors stabilize RAF in an inactive conformation and inhibit both dimer protomers, thus inhibiting downstream MAPK/ERK activity in the setting of BRAF fusions. A previously-healthy 33 year old man was diagnosed with DL-GNT, which harbored a pathogenic BRAF:KIAA1549 gene fusion. He was initially treated with a MEK inhibitor but developed drug-related cardiotoxicity. Without treatment, he developed significant functional limitations due to leptomeningeal disease. A compassionate use indication was pursued for an investigational CNS-penetrant type II BRAF inhibitor, tovorafenib. Within 3 months of initiating the medication, the patient experienced notable gains in functional status and with over 12 months of treatment has been able to rejoin recreational activities. This case highlights the importance of tumor molecular characterization, particularly in rare tumors, whereby identification of the BRAF:KIAA1594 gene fusion led to an appropriate selection of a type II BRAF inhibitor.",,,

Despite the distressing nature of this symptom, clinicians frequently underestimate its prevalence and it is under-reported by patients who may be unaware of the availability of effective treatment options. The identification and management of CKD-associated pruritus should form an essential aspect of patient-centred care; however, patients with CKD may have multiple causes of chronic itch including those of dermatological, systemic, neuropathic and psychogenic origin, and CKD-associated pruritus must be distinguished from these. Together with its highly variable presentation in patients on haemodialysis, the range of potential causes of itch makes differential diagnosis of CKD-associated pruritus challenging. The presence of bilaterally symmetrical and non-dermatomally distributed itching, commonly affecting the back, limbs, chest and head is characteristic of CKD-associated pruritus, although approximately 50% of patients report generalized pruritus. Secondary skin lesions (including excoriation, crusts, impetigo, lichenifications and prurigo also seen in dermatological conditions) may or may not be observed, and xerosis (dry skin) that may exacerbate itching is common. Here, we provide a pragmatic approach to the identification and differential diagnosis of chronic itching in CKD-associated pruritus with the aim of supporting the effective management of this highly distressing symptom in clinical practice.",Lanot A; Aucella F,Department of Nephrology and Dialysis; Normandie Université,

Strategies to improve the healthcare landscape for RDs in SA have also been recommended. A 1-day workshop, conducted at the Saudi Health Council in Riyadh, SA on 5 June 2023, gathered stakeholders from the government, private sector, pharmaceutical industry, legislators, regulators, providers, payers, academia, and insurance companies. Through a series of presentations, educational sessions, and plenary discussions, participants examined the current landscape of RDs in SA, identified barriers to accessing ODs, and recommended strategies and initiatives to improve the accessibility, innovation, and sustainability of ODs. The workshop highlighted key challenges recognized by a diverse group of 59 participants, including the absence of a national strategy, absent of local RDs and ODs definitions in the Saudi context, limited awareness and understanding of RDs among healthcare professionals, delayed diagnoses, scarcity of treatment and diagnosis centers for RDs, insufficient screening and prevention programs, regulatory hurdles in approving and importing ODs, and financial constraints. These challenges significantly impact patient access to ODs, imposing additional burdens on patients, families, healthcare systems, and society. The recommended strategies to enhance RD and OD accessibility include multifaceted approaches, such as increasing medical education and awareness, accrediting and investing in expanding the number of centers of excellence for RD diagnosis and management, streamlining regulatory processes for OD approval and importation, fostering international collaborations for knowledge exchange and capacity building, and implementing national policies to improve the affordability and reimbursement of ODs. Stakeholder collaboration is crucial to overcome the accessibility challenges of RDs and ODs. The development of comprehensive national RD strategies ensures equitable resource allocation, a national RD registry, and infrastructure improvements. These measures are vital for ensuring equitable access to ODs and the efficient provision of healthcare services in SA.",Alrabiah A; AlMuaither A,General Directorate of National Health Policies and Economics; C enter for Health Technology Assessment,
40376143,How do we put meaning into meaningful benefit? Perspectives from the lived experience.,,"Alzheimer's & dementia (New York, N. Y.)",10.1002/trc2.70095,"Meaningful benefit is a much-debated concept in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Research to date has primarily focused on change thresholds that are anchored in clinicians' or care partners' impressions; however, these thresholds are not inherently meaningful to people living with AD (PLWAD) and may not take their perspectives into account. By overlaying the lived experience of AD through the eyes of individual PLWAD and their care partners with clinical outcomes, we offer an important framework in which to consider meaningful benefit in terms of symptoms, functioning, and outcomes. The PLWAD and care partner interviews and surveys of the What Matters Most (WMM) research program have identified treatment-related needs, preferences, and priorities of people at risk of or living with AD and their care partners across the AD continuum. A WMM conceptual model of disease-created and refined through interviews with PLWAD and care partners across the AD severity spectrum-includes 50 concepts across six domains (social life/activities, thought processing, communication, daily activities, mood/emotion, and general independence) considered important to all PLWAD and care partners. From the PLWAD and care partner perspectives, an increase in time to the onset, development, or worsening of the symptoms in any of these meaningful concepts was considered a meaningful benefit. No single commonly used clinical outcome assessment captures all concepts of importance, nor the importance of time in AD; considering the lived experience and priorities of individuals affected by AD is crucial to put the ""meaning"" in ""meaningful.""",Paulsen R; Romano CD; Frangiosa T; Mordin M; Dardis GJ; DiBenedetti D; Petersen RC,Department of Neurology Mayo Clinic Rochester Minnesota USA.; Faegre Drinker Consulting Washington District of Columbia USA.; UsAgainstAlzheimer's Washington District of Columbia USA.; RTI Health Solutions Durham North Carolina USA.,

The primary determinant of drug development is the creation of products that adhere to the highest standards of quality and safety, with a particular emphasis on effectively managing impurities in the therapeutic ingredients. To ensure that the resulting pharmaceutical possesses a high level of safety, meticulous identification, precise quantification, and stringent management of any extraneous components present in the drug ingredient need to be performed. The literature was compiled from different databases, such as DOAJ, PubMed, Research Gate, Google Scholar, Scopus, and Science Direct. Several organic and inorganic contaminants that are frequently present in final products and active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) were covered, along with the crucial section for quality control and fundamental details on their security, toxicity, detection limits, and quantification limitations. Pharmaceutical companies resolve the problem of the presence of impurities by adhering to strict regulatory requirements set by reputable agencies, like the ICH, USFDA, EMA, and PMDA. Also, impurity profiling is required for the regulatory submissions of new drug candidates. In some pharmacopoeias, impurity profiling and reporting are also included. To identify and measure contaminants, a variety of analytical techniques are employed, as discussed in this article. This paper covers the scientific features of contaminants present in pharmaceutical preparations, their prevention strategies, and the application of state-of-the-art analytical techniques for their detection.",,,

This innovative approach aims to improve the prognostication of the system and the identification of treatment-relevant patient populations by more accurately stratifying patients based on tumor biology, representing a significant advancement toward personalized medicine. However, its implementation poses challenges, including the heterogeneous availability of molecular testing worldwide, and the need for further standardization and prospective validation of some of the newly introduced histopathological parameters. To address these innovations and related controversies, a meeting of physicians, including gynecologic oncologists and pathologists, was held. This article summarizes the reflections that emerged from this meeting, focusing on key elements such as the integration of histopathologic features (eg, ""high-grade, aggressive histologic types,"" ""substantial lymphovascular space invasion""), molecular classification, and the implications for global reproducibility and applicability. It also addresses the basic approach toward staging: should it offer integrated, patient-relevant information to enable accurate prognostication and inform treatment decisions or should a staging system simply provide a common language to communicate disease extent? The meeting provided an opportunity for a group of physicians to share considerations on this evolving topic. Our article highlights focal points of change in the new staging system and identifies key areas for future research, advocating for collaborative efforts to generate more robust evidence on some variables introduced in the staging system through prospective studies. By addressing these challenges, we aim to improve the applicability and effectiveness of the new International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics staging system in real-world scenarios and identify elements that may require further refinement, ultimately advancing precision medicine in endometrial cancer care.",Palmieri E; Mariani A; Coleman R; Scambia G,Texas Oncology; Fondazione Policlinico Universitario Agostino Gemelli IRCCS; Mayo Clinic,palmieri.emilia@mayo.edu.

We investigated the performance of common echo measurements, GLS, and their combinations in discriminating CA from an undifferentiated cohort with increased left ventricular wall thickness. We conducted a retrospective single-centre case-control study of 876 echos from 232 patients with CA and 1325 echos from 279 patients who underwent pyrophosphate scintigraphy but had CA definitively ruled out. Common echo measurements were collected and additional GLS measurements were performed post hoc. We reported discrimination performance with the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and associated sensitivity, specificity and positive predictive value at the optimal threshold. We found that the ratio of end-diastolic interventricular septal thickness (IVSd) to GLS had the highest performance in differentiating CA with an AUC of 0.812. At the optimal threshold of >0.15, IVSd/GLS had a sensitivity of 0.70 and specificity of 0.80 for CA. Other measurements and ratios, including the ratio of left ventricular ejection fraction to GLS (AUC 0.682), had lower performance when evaluated against a suspicious control cohort with increased left ventricular wall thickness. If validated in prospective multi-centre studies, the routine measurement of IVSd/GLS can assist with earlier diagnosis of CA, resulting in earlier initiation of treatment in this underserved population.",Daluwatte C; Ricchiuto P,Alexion Pharmaceuticals Inc,piero.ricchiuto@alexion.com.

Among the various Sceletium species, S. tortuosum is used for its mood-enhancing properties, attributed to the structurally related mesembrine-type alkaloids found therein. While significant research has focused on mesembrine and mesembrenone, the therapeutic potential of extracts from plants that produce more of the so-called ""minor alkaloids"", remains unexplored. To assess the CNS modulatory effects of two chemotypes of S. tortuosum, wild-collected from two different geographic locations in South Africa (Touwsrivier and De Rust), each featuring different alkaloid profiles and with elevated minor alkaloid concentrations. Extracts from these chemotypes, as well as a vehicle control and a commercial extract, were administered to four groups of mice for 35 days. Mice were then euthanised, and their frontal cortices, striata and hippocampi dissected. Serotonin, dopamine, noradrenaline, glutamate, and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) concentrations were analysed using LC-MS. Both chemotypes, compared to both control and commercial extract exposure, robustly increased noradrenaline and decreased GABA concentrations in all regions of the mouse brain analysed. This finding may support a mood-enhancing effect of S. tortuosum and indicates its potential to modulate anxiety and stress processing, attention, and alertness. Alkaloid profiling further suggests that the mesembrine alcohols and sceletium A4 may be important contributors in driving these neurochemical changes.",,,kaschula@sun.ac.za.

Disease-related pain is frequently reported as the most troublesome symptom of HS. The SUNSHINE and SUNRISE phase 3 trials previously reported that secukinumab improved control of pain in patients with moderate to severe HS. The objective of this analysis was to evaluate the impact of secukinumab on multiple aspects of pain in patients with HS from SUNSHINE and SUNRISE. Patients were randomised to receive secukinumab 300 mg every 2 (SECQ2W) or 4 weeks (SECQ4W), or placebo until week 16. At week 16, the placebo group switched to receive SECQ2W (placebo-SECQ2W) or SECQ4W (placebo-SECQ4W), whereas the secukinumab groups continued their treatment, until week 52. Pain was assessed using the Patient's Global Assessment of skin pain‒at worst on a continuous numeric rating scale (NRS) through week 52. Quartiles were used to categorise pain severity groups based on baseline NRS scores (NRS ≤ 3.3; NRS > 3.3 to ≤ 5.4; NRS > 5.4 to ≤ 7.2; NRS > 7.2). Additional assessments included quality of life (QoL) and pain medication use. At week 16, a greater mean (standard deviation) absolute change from baseline in skin pain was observed for patients treated with secukinumab [SECQ2W (- 1.35 (2.16)); SECQ4W (- 1.05 (2.02))] versus placebo [- 0.47 (2.07)]. In the SECQ2W and SECQ4W groups, in patients with NRS > 7.2 at baseline, 20.0% and 12.7% had NRS ≤ 3.3 at week 16, respectively. This improvement in pain was maintained through week 52. Moreover, patients in the NRS ≤ 3.3 category generally experienced better QoL. The proportion of patients reporting pain medication use was generally reduced at weeks 16 and 52 versus baseline in the secukinumab groups. This analysis highlights the sustained benefits of secukinumab in reducing pain in patients with moderate to severe HS. These pain reductions were associated with QoL improvements.

40372247,RNA therapeutics-An evaluation of potential occupational health hazards and a strategy to establish occupational exposure limits (OELs).,,Journal of occupational and environmental hygiene,10.1080/15459624.2025.2485080,"RNA therapeutics represent a rapidly expanding and innovative group of pharmaceuticals. These new modalities necessitate the establishment of Occupational Exposure Limits (OELs) to ensure safe occupational handling. While there is an established methodology for setting OELs for small molecule therapeutics, this methodology is not readily applicable to large molecule RNA therapeutics that deserve additional considerations in their safety assessment, particularly for aspects related to their unique modes of action. This research, which involves an extensive review of the data available for RNA therapeutics to derive substance-specific OELs and to propose a strategy for low-characterized RNA therapeutics, fills this crucial gap. It is recommended to apply an activity correction factor (ACF) in the OEL formula for large molecules, as representative of the ""α"" in the OEL formula for small molecules, considering differences in route of administration, critical effects, mechanism of action, and the RNA delivery platform. Additionally, it is proposed to consider lower OEL values for mRNA vaccines as compared to other RNA therapeutics. Finally, it is suggested that the exposure assessment experience that has already been acquired when handling therapeutic proteins can also be used to define containment strategies for RNA therapeutics.

Local complement activation drives C5a generation associated with neutrophil recruitment and activation resulting in skin lesions and inflammation. Here we tested the impact of C5a/C5adesArg, C5 or combined C5 and alternative pathway (AP) targeting on disease development and skin inflammation in a preclinical mouse model mimicking the effector phase of EBA. C57BL/6 mice were treated subcutaneously with purified rabbit anti-mouse-COL7 IgG in the presence of IgG1 mAbs directed against murine C5a/C5adesArg (M031), C5 (mBB5.1), a bifunctional protein comprising mBB5.1 fused to an active fragment of the AP inhibitor factor H (M014) or an IgG1 isotype control mAb. Formation of skin lesions was evaluated 12 days every other day. On day 12, DEJ separation, IgG AAb and C3b deposition and neutrophil infiltration was assessed. Isotype IgG1-treated mice developed first skin lesions on day 4 peaking on day 12. Prophylactic treatment with either M031 or M014 markedly reduced the development of skin lesions, the dermal/epidermal separation and neutrophil recruitment. Surprisingly, C5 or combined AP/C5 inhibition by M014 but not C5a/C5adesArg-targeting by M031 reduced the development of skin lesions and dermal/epidermal separation in the setting of therapeutic treatment. IgG and C3b deposition was not affected by either treatment. Importantly, direct comparison of isolated C5 targeting by mBB5.1 vs. combined AP/C5 inhibition by M014 revealed that M014 reduced the development of skin lesions earlier and more pronounced than mBB5.1.

There were no differences between patients ≥ 70 and < 70 years in clinical remission rates (week 6: 57.5% vs. 47.6%, p = 0.9174; week 14: 62.5% vs. 54.8%, p = 0.1317; week 54: 47.5% vs. 46.4%, p = 0.8149), primary nonresponse (10.0% vs. 15.5%, p = 0.6248), loss of response (12.5% vs. 9.4%, p = 0.5675), or overall safety. Among patients ≥ 70 years, the incidence of adverse drug reactions was numerically greater in those with concomitant corticosteroids than in those without. For older patients with and without late-onset UC, week 54 remission rates were 23.1% versus 57.7% (p = 0.0544); surgery was reported in 3/13 versus 2/26 patients and hospitalization in 5/13 versus 6/26 patients. One death was reported in patients with late-onset UC. VDZ effectiveness and safety were similar in patients ≥ 70 and < 70 years; VDZ may be a suitable treatment option for patients ≥ 70 years with UC. Patients with late-onset UC tended to have more frequent surgery/hospitalization and lower effectiveness than those without, possibly necessitating greater caution when using VDZ.

40369578,Sharing health data for research purposes: results of a population survey in Germany.,2025-05-15,BMC health services research,10.1186/s12913-025-12706-9,"Increased use of health data has the potential to improve both health care and health policies. Several recent policy initiatives at the European and German legislative levels aim to increase the primary and secondary use of health data. However, little is known about general population views on health data access for research. Most studies are based on subsets defined by specific illnesses. We commissioned a national computer-assisted dual-frame telephone survey (landline and mobile). Logit estimation models were used to identify predictors of willingness to provide access to health data to different organizations (universities in Germany, universities worldwide, German government organizations, pharmaceutical companies). A high willingness to share health data for research purposes is observed, depending on the specific data recipient. The willingness is highest for research at universities in Germany and German governmental organizations, and lowest regarding research by pharmaceutical companies. The main drivers for sharing health data are the level of trust in public institutions, the respondents' assessment of the seriousness and likelihood of data misuse, and the level of digital literacy. Age, gender, and level of education have small effects and do not determine the willingness to share health data for all organizations. We present evidence from a random sample of the German population. The results indicate widespread support among the population for providing access to health data for research purposes. Similar to findings in other countries, the willingness depends strongly on the recipient of the data. This paper evaluates the impact of various determinants - identified in previous qualitative and quantitative research - on the willingness of the German population to share health data. While previous studies have found that patients are generally more willing to share health data, we found that the presence of a medical precondition does not translate into respondents' unequivocal support for health data sharing. We identify privacy concerns, general trust, and digital literacy as key factors influencing the willingness to share health data. Therefore, policymakers and stakeholders need to ensure and communicate the necessary privacy protection measures to increase the willingness of the German population to share health data.",Dotter C; Haug S; Schnell R; Raptis G; Weber K,OTH Regensburg; Universität Duisburg-Essen,caroline1.dotter@oth-regensburg.de.

Although the precise pathogenesis and mechanisms of HFS remain unclear, inflammatory reactions are thought to be involved. The preventive effects of topical diclofenac gel have been reported from India. However, the trial did not evaluate its preventive effect for the sole, and the HFS incidence in the control group was lower than that in previous reports. Therefore, this study aims to confirm the preventive effects of diclofenac sodium 0.1% cream for capecitabine-induced HFS. This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial. Patients scheduled to receive capecitabine-containing chemotherapy are enrolled, and participants are prophylactically treated with topical diclofenac sodium 0.1% cream or placebo alongside standard preventive therapy. The primary endpoint is an incidence of grade 2 HFS within 3 months. The secondary endpoints include time to onset of HFS, incidences of dose reduction, schedule delay, discontinuation caused by capecitabine-induced HFS, dose intensity of capecitabine, an incidence of grade ≥ 2 peripheral sensory neuropathy, incidences of other capecitabine-related adverse events (nausea, vomiting, appetite loss, diarrhea, oral mucositis, pigmentation, abnormality of liver and renal functions, and neutropenia). If this study meets the primary endpoint, a new standard preventive therapy for HFS will be established.

40369344,A modular mRNA vaccine platform encoding antigen-presenting capsid virus-like particles enhances the immunogenicity of the malaria antigen Pfs25.,,Nature nanotechnology,10.1038/s41565-025-01889-1,"The COVID-19 pandemic has emphasized the potential of mRNA vaccines in fighting pandemics, owing to their rapid development, strong immunogenicity and adaptability. However, a drawback is their dose-limiting reactogenicity and inability to generate durable humoral immunity. Here we introduce a modular nucleotide vaccine platform combining the advantages of genetic and capsid virus-like-particle-based vaccines. This platform allows for the display of various antigens on different capsid virus-like particles, improving the magnitude, quality and longevity of the vaccine-induced immune responses. We applied this technology to enhance the immunogenicity of the Pfs25 antigen. Immunization with lipid-nanoparticle-formulated mRNA encoding Pfs25 capsid virus-like particles resulted in higher and potentially more durable anti-Pfs25 antibody responses, along with enhanced functional activity, compared with an mRNA vaccine encoding soluble Pfs25. By improving both humoral and cellular immune responses, this approach may reduce the dose and number of administrations required for effective protection. As a result, it can improve the feasibility of both DNA- and mRNA-based vaccines targeting pandemic and endemic infectious diseases.",Fougeroux C; Hagen SH; Goksøyr L; van de Vegte-Bolmer M; van Gemert GJ; Jore MM; de Jongh WA; Sander Bertelsen AF,Department of Medical Microbiology; AdaptVac Aps,asander@sund.ku.dk.

Accordingly, we assessed the predictive ability of prognostic models including MRE scores (MRE Global Score (MEGS), simplified MR Index of Activity (sMARIA), and Lémann index (LI)) against models using clinical predictors alone for the development of modified Beaugerie disabling CD (MBDD) within 5 years of diagnosis. This was a multicentre, diagnostic inception cohort of patients with newly diagnosed CD across 9 UK hospitals, followed for 4 years or more. We censored development of MBDD ≤ 90 days from diagnosis, and used time-to-event models using Royston-Parmer flexible parametric models. We included 194 patients, median age 29, IQR 22-44 years, 52% female. Within 5 years of diagnosis, 42% (81/194) developed MBDD. In univariable analysis, initial steroid requirement was associated with increased risk of developing MBDD (HR 2.11 (95% CI 1.36, 3.26). The baseline clinical model had 49% (39, 60) sensitivity and 66% (57, 74) specificity for predicting the top 40% of patients with the greatest risk of developing MBDD, and 86% (77, 92) sensitivity and 35% (27, 45) specificity for predicting the development of MBDD in patients with an absolute risk of ≥ 10%. There was no significant difference in sensitivity when the MEGS, sMARIA, or LI were added to the baseline clinical model. Addition of MRE scores at diagnosis to a multivariable model comprising clinical predictors did not improve prediction of MBDD within 5 years of diagnosis. Question Magnetic resonance enterography (MRE) is important for diagnosing and monitoring Crohn's disease (CD), but primary research evaluating its prognostic role is lacking. Findings Adding MRE findings at diagnosis to a multivariable model comprising clinical predictors did not improve the prediction of disabling CD within 5 years of diagnosis. Clinical relevance When tested in a prospective, multicentre trial, current MRE activity and damage scores at diagnosis did not reliably predict whether patients would subsequently develop disabling CD. Notwithstanding this finding, MRE remains an essential tool for diagnosis and monitoring.",Eze V,Department of Radiology,stuart.taylor@ucl.ac.uk.

Here, we evaluate the effect of different metabolic and bariatric surgery interventions on the use of medications to treat chronic conditions. This was an observational population-based cohort study performed in Lombardy, Italy. Healthcare utilization databases were used to identify all residents who underwent a metabolic and bariatric surgery procedure between 2010 and 2020 with available follow-up data for at least three years after surgery. We included patients undergoing laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG), gastric bypass (GB), laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding (LAGB), and biliopancreatic diversion (BPD). During the period 2010 to 2020, 19,450 patients (22.5% males, 13.5% with diabetes) underwent a metabolic and bariatric surgery procedure. LSG was the most commonly performed procedure (65%), followed by LAGB (19%), GB (15%), and BPD (1%). There was a significant reduction in the use of glucose-lowering and antihypertensive drugs after the procedure in all groups. Compared to LSG, the reduction in the use of glucose-lowering drugs was greater following GB (reduction at 3 years: 59 vs 65%, p-interaction < 0.001) and lower following LAGB (59 vs 25%, p-interaction < 0.001). There was a significant reduction in lipid-lowering drug use following LSG and GB (3-year reduction: 21 and 50%, p-interaction < 0.001), and in psychiatric drug use following LSG, GB, and LAGB (with no difference between groups). In all groups, proton pump inhibitor use increased during the first 6 months, followed by a decrease from 1 year afterward. The present study including a large number of patients undergoing metabolic and bariatric surgery procedures shows robust reductions in the use of glucose, blood pressure and lipid-lowering drugs at 3 years follow-up, suggesting benefits of surgery on both quality of life and healthcare costs.",Muraca E; Oltolini A; Bongo A,Policlinico di Monza,stefano.ciardullo@unimib.it.

The authors sought to investigate the efficacy of tirzepatide in improving different cardiometabolic risk factors across individuals and subpopulations. Using an independent, global data-sharing and analytics platform, we performed an individual participant data meta-analysis by pooling data from 7 Phase 3 randomized clinical trials that compared tirzepatide with placebo or standard antihyperglycemic agents in individuals with type 2 diabetes. The study outcomes were the presence of a range of cardiometabolic abnormalities, representing components of metabolic syndrome (MetS) (elevated waist circumference, triglycerides, blood pressure, and fasting blood glucose, and decreased high-density lipoprotein cholesterol), as well as elevated body mass index and MetS (≥3 cardiometabolic abnormalities). Outcomes were modeled using mixed-effects models, with inverse probability weighting to account for study design differences. We included 7,805 participants with a weighted median age of 59 years (Q1-Q3: 51-66 years) and 43.2% women. Over a weighted median treatment duration of 41.0 weeks, tirzepatide reduced the odds of all cardiometabolic abnormalities, ranging from 34% reduction for the odds of decreased high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (OR: 0.66 [95% CI: 0.52-0.84]) to 96% reduction in the odds of elevated body mass index (OR: 0.04 [95% CI:0.02-0.08]), and 72% reduction for the odds of MetS (OR: 0.28 [95% CI: 0.24-0.33]). Tirzepatide's superior efficacy in resolving MetS was consistent across demographic and clinical subpopulations, with higher efficacy in age <65 years vs ≥65 years, and in individuals without vs with baseline use of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (P for interaction = 0.008 and 0.009, respectively).

Advances,10.1016/j.jacadv.2025.101767,"Racial and ethnic disparities in cardiovascular disease outcomes, including percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), are well-documented. However, studies do not stratify certain subgroups, such as separating South Asian and East Asian patients, who exhibit varying burdens of cardiovascular disease and PCI outcomes. Additionally, socioeconomic status (SES) further complicates outcomes, with low SES serving as an independent predictor of adverse outcomes post-PCI. This study aimed to analyze PCI outcomes across 5 racial and ethnic groups-White, Black, Hispanic, South Asian, and East Asian populations-while accounting for comorbidities and SES to better understand how race and ethnicity influence cardiovascular outcomes. We conducted a retrospective cohort study of patients undergoing PCI from 2012 to 2022. Patients were stratified by race/ethnicity and matched to median household income based on U.S. Census Zone Improvement Plan code data. The primary endpoint was 1-year major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE). Multivariable Cox regression models were used to assess outcomes, adjusting for comorbidities and SES. A total of 21,236 patients were included: 47.8% White, 11.3% Black, 18.0% Hispanic, 20.7% South Asian, and 2.2% East Asian. South Asian patients had significantly lower MACE (adjusted HR: 0.62; P < 0.001) compared with White patients. Black patients, in contrast, had a higher risk of MACE (adjusted HR: 1.27; P = 0.032). Significant racial and ethnic disparities exist in 1-year PCI outcomes, with South Asian patients exhibiting favorable outcomes compared with White patients, and Black patients experiencing worse outcomes. Baseline comorbidities and estimated SES do not fully explain these disparities, suggesting that targeted strategies are needed to address the multifactorial influences on PCI outcomes across racial and ethnic groups.",,,samin.sharma@mountsinai.org.

The present study examined 3,875 papers published in Radiography, Journal of Medical Imaging and Radiation Sciences, and Journal of Medical Radiation Sciences since their inclusion in the Scopus database. Quantitative bibliometric indicators, including publication counts, citation performance, and mean citations per article/year, were computed using the Bibliometrix package in R Studio. Co-authorship and institutional collaboration networks were visualized using VOSviewer. Keyword co-occurrence analysis was also conducted to identify dominant research areas and trace their evolution over time. Findings revealed a substantial rise in research output, increasing from 15 publications in 1995 to 456 in 2024. Citation impact peaked in 2017, with a gradual decline in subsequent years. The most prolific authors included Hogg P., Bolderston A., and Reed W., while the University of Salford, University of Toronto, and University of Sydney emerged as the leading institutions across the three journals. The United Kingdom, Canada, and Australia were dominant contributors, with a notable rise in participation from African and Asian countries. Funding was primarily supported by national health agencies, cancer-focused organizations, and academic institutions. Keyword analysis revealed nine major thematic clusters, including diagnostic imaging technologies, oncology, clinical practice, education, patient-centered care, and public health. Importantly, eight highly cited papers (≥100 citations) were identified, many of which contributed significantly to the professionalization of radiography, expanded the role of radiographers in diagnostic reporting, and integrated emerging technologies such as AI and digital imaging-marking key milestones in the field's development.

We evaluated changes in body mass index (BMI), body fat percentage, skeletal muscle mass and skeletal muscle mass index (SMI) over 4.4 years on average. This retrospective, single-center clinical cohort study utilized electronic medical records from the University of Tokyo Hospital. 70 people with T2D treated with SGLT2i for more than two years were included. Body compositions were assessed using bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) at three time points: before SGLT2i therapy, 1 year after SGLT2 therapy initiation and the latest along with SGLT2i therapy. During the 4.4-year average treatment period, significant reductions were observed in BMI (30.5 to 29.1, p < 0.0001) and skeletal muscle mass (30.3 kg to 29.0 kg, p < 0.0001). ΔBMI was positively correlated with ΔBody fat percentage and ΔSkeletal muscle mass (all p < 0.0001). Age-stratified analysis showed that in younger individuals, ΔSkeletal muscle mass was significantly associated with both treatment duration and ΔBMI. In contrast, older individuals showed a weaker correlation between ΔSkeletal muscle mass and ΔBMI, and experienced significant muscle mass decline at an earlier point. SGLT2i are effective in managing T2D and reducing BMI and body fat. However, careful monitoring of body composition is crucial, especially in older individuals, to mitigate the risk of sarcopenia and maintain overall health.",,,kmiyoshi-uthp@g.ecc.u-tokyo.ac.jp.
40367577,High levels of benzene in benzoyl peroxide - A sample preparation artefact?,,Journal of pharmaceutical and biomedical analysis,10.1016/j.jpba.2025.116946,"Benzene is a known carcinogen, that can be formed during the degradation of benzoyl peroxide (BPO). Most analytical methods for the analysis of solvents in active pharmaceutical ingredients (API's) do not account for the radical degradation of BPO when in solution, thus resulting in artefactually high amounts of benzene. In this study we proposed and demonstrated that the use of a strong inorganic base (KOH) promotes a fast BPO degradation into benzoic acid. This was confirmed by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). By analyzing pure benzoic acid we confirmed that it is not a source of benzene in its pure form, proving the usefulness of this degradation pathway. Using the USP methodology (based on headspace gas chromatography (HS-GC)) the levels of benzene are around 20 ppm, 100 times higher than results obtained using our proposed methodology (around 0.20 ppm). A comparable amount of benzene, around 0.20 ppm, was determined in three different BPO batches produced in different years (2019, 2021 and 2024,) and stored in controlled conditions. This suggests that the residual amounts of benzene detected derive from the radical induced pathway and not degradation over time. Validation demonstrated linearity, accuracy and precision in the range of 0.1-4.1 ppm of benzene in BPO. In this study benzene was analyzed by headspace gas chromatography mass spectrometry (HS-GC-MS). Our results show the importance of developing robust analytical methods that can generate accurate and trustworthy results when analyzing benzene in BPO.",Dang N; Mattsson J; Lanebjer A; Neto R; Nilsson M,Research and development analytical department,Mikael.Nilsson@cambrex.com.

It remains a major global health issue, with 263 million cases and 597,000 deaths in 2023, primarily affecting young children and pregnant women. This review evaluates awareness, acceptance, hesitancy, and willingness to pay (WTP) for the RTS,S/AS01 malaria vaccine, along with the key factors influencing these outcomes. A comprehensive literature search was conducted in Web of Science, PubMed, and Embase, covering publications up to 18 June 2024. Observational studies assessing awareness, acceptance, hesitancy, and WTP for the malaria vaccine in endemic regions were included. Two independent reviewers screened the studies. Data extraction was performed using Nested Knowledge software and analyzed with R v.4.4. Pooled prevalences were estimated using random-effects models, and heterogeneity was assessed with the I² statistic. Eighteen studies with 21,975 participants provided insights into malaria vaccine dynamics: 32% awareness (95% CI, 18%-50%), 83% acceptance (95% CI, 75%-89%), 14% hesitancy (95% CI, 7%-26%), and 58% WTP (95% CI, 34%-79%). Key determinants of acceptance included age, where younger adults (18-24 years) showed lower acceptance (OR = 0.64, 95% CI, 0.35-0.93). Employment, particularly farmers, had higher acceptance rates (OR = 3.20, 95% CI, 1.00-7.40). Lower socioeconomic status and larger family sizes were associated with decreased acceptance (OR = 0.18, 95% CI, 0.02-0.38). This review revealed an 83% acceptance rate for the malaria vaccine, with variability in awareness (32%), hesitancy (14%), and willingness to pay (58%). Age, employment, and socioeconomic status were significant determinants of acceptance. However, due to potential publication bias and high heterogeneity, these findings should be cautiously interpreted.

This study investigated whether lifestyle restrictions are associated with relapse reduction and assessed their impact on QOL. This multicenter, prospective cohort study was conducted in Japan (2018-2021) via the YOURS registry, enrolling patients with UC in clinical remission. Patients were followed for 2 years. A baseline questionnaire evaluated lifestyle restrictions in diet, work/study/housework, and physical exercise. QOL was assessed by Disease Impact Scale every 3 months during the first year of follow-up. Associations of lifestyle restrictions with relapse and QOL were assessed by Cox regression analysis and linear mixed-effects models, respectively. Among 911 patients in clinical remission for > 90 days, 63% had adopted dietary avoidance; 47%, work/study/housework avoidance; and 8%, physical exercise avoidance. Overall, 216 patients relapsed. Lifestyle restrictions were not associated with reduced risk of relapse (multivariableadjusted hazard ratios [95% confidence interval]: dietary avoidance, 1.08 [0.81-1.44]; and work/study/housework avoidance, 1.14 [0.87-1.50]); physical exercise avoidance was associated with increased relapse (multivariable-adjusted hazard ratio, 1.58; 95% confidence interval, 1.02-2.44). All lifestyle restrictions were associated with impaired QOL (P <0.01). Lifestyle restrictions were not associated with relapse reduction in patients with UC; however, they were associated with impaired QOL. Clinicians should engage in evidence-based discussions with patients with UC in remission regarding lifestyle restrictions (UMIN Clinical Trials Registry; UMIN000031995).",Limdi JK; McLaughlin JT; Fernandez J,Department of Gastroenterology; Japan Medical Office,

Midazolam has been used as a sedative for hospitalized children on- and off-label; however, factors affecting interindividual variability (IIV) in observed clearance for this population are not fully understood and can result in extreme under- or overexposure. Obesity has been described as a significant influence on midazolam in adolescents, which could potentially alter drug exposure. The goal of this study was to use two modeling strategies to evaluate dose-exposure of midazolam in children with and without obesity. Population pharmacokinetic modeling assessed whether measures of obesity status would explain some of the observed IIV for midazolam clearance. In all, 164 plasma concentrations were collected from 93 participating children, many with obesity. Covariate modeling did not identify any factors influential to clearance beyond body weight. Model IIV was similar to that observed in previous models of critically ill children (coefficient of variation, 175%) along with considerable residual unexplained variability (50.4%). Then, a previously published virtual population of children with obesity was incorporated into an existing physiologically based pharmacokinetic model of midazolam in the open-source PK-Sim software. Dosing simulations for a subset of 46 participants demonstrated minor overpredictions in children with obesity compared to those without. Both models predicted a minor (< 20%) increase in exposure for children with obesity given the same weight-based dose. This research demonstrates the use of population pharmacokinetics combined with physiologically based pharmacokinetic modeling to compare simulated exposures in children with and without obesity.",Anderson SG; Turdalieva S; ,; The Emmes Company,

Polyphenol extracts from sugarcane molasses (SP) show antioxidant and anti-inflammatory potential, yet their protective effects against ALD have not been elucidated. This study explored the therapeutic potential of SP in alcohol-induced chronic liver damage. A graded alcohol concentration-induced liver damage model was established in C57BL/6J mice to systematically evaluate SP's regulatory effects on liver function markers, lipid metabolism, oxidative stress indicators, inflammatory factors, and related molecular mechanisms through a 10-week nutritional intervention. The results demonstrated that SP intervention significantly inhibited the liver index, alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase activities, and triglyceride and total cholesterol accumulation in mice. SP enhanced antioxidant enzyme activities in a dose-dependent manner, with the high-dose group increasing catalase activity by 161.19% and superoxide dismutase activity by 22.97%. Furthermore, SP significantly reduced the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including interleukin-1β, interleukin-6, and tumor necrosis factor-α, thereby alleviating hepatic inflammatory infiltration. Mechanistic studies revealed that SP effectively mitigated alcohol-induced oxidative stress and inflammatory injury by inhibiting cytochrome P450 2E1 overexpression, regulating the Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 signaling pathway, and suppressing nuclear factor-kappa B pathway activation. The findings reveal that SP mitigates ALD via synergistic antioxidant and anti-inflammatory mechanisms, providing a novel strategy for high-value utilization of sugarcane molasses byproducts in agricultural industries. Future studies should focus on the contribution of the different phenolics in SP and validate their specific hepatoprotective mechanisms.",Zhang C,The Product Makers Co.,

Specific GAG-binding patterns are rarely identified, with the heparin pentasaccharide as an Antithrombin-III ligand being the best characterized. Generating glycan-specific antibodies is difficult due to their size, pattern dispersion, and flexibility. Single-domain variable new antigen receptors (VNAR nanobodies) from nurse sharks are highly soluble, stable, and versatile. Their unique properties suggest advantages over conventional antibodies, particularly for challenging biotherapeutic targets. Here we have used VNAR semi-synthetic phage libraries to select high-affinity fondaparinux-binding VNARs that did not show cross-reactivity with other GAG species. Competition ELISA and surface plasmon resonance identified a single fondaparinux-selective VNAR clone. This VNAR exhibited an extraordinarily stable protein fold: the beta-strands are stabilized by a robust hydrophobic network, as revealed by heteronuclear NMR. Docking fondaparinux to the VNAR structure revealed a large contact surface area between the CDR3 loop of the antibody and the glycan.

Our scoping review aims to investigate the extent of emergency department clinical registries reported in peer-reviewed literature. We conducted a scoping review of ED registries in accordance with the PRISMA-ScR checklist. Searches were undertaken in PUBMED, EMBASE, and SCOPUS. Studies were included if they described a clinical registry with a focus on the ED. We identified 60 manuscripts with 27 identified as primary registries (6 had a general scope, 21 were condition or population specific). The remaining 33 papers were investigational reports sourced from the identified primary registries. Funding sources were identified for some registries: three by research grants, two by medical colleges, five by government organizations or initiatives, two by pharmaceutical companies, and three by research institutes. No funding information was provided in 12 studies. The reported registry periods ranged from 31 days to 4018 days (median 365 days, IQR 181-1309 days). A grey literature search revealed that six registries were ongoing. Internationally, there appears to be a wide degree of heterogeneity with primary ED registry publications and secondary publications. Having a standardized approach to ED registries is needed.

These drugs induce macrocytosis without anemia in most patients. The mechanism for the red blood cell (RBC) changes is unknown. In vitro and animal studies show that RBCs from CDK6-knockout mice have increased membrane fragility, but the clinical impact of CDK4/6is on human RBC lifespan is not known. We sought to determine the impact of CDK4/6is on RBC lifespan and detect changes in the regulation of hemoglobin production. Using the mean corpuscular volume (MCV) measurements at several time points, we can study the evolution of MCV, mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC), and RBC count over time. From this, one can estimate the RBC lifespan under CDK4/6is. We performed a unicentric retrospective study. Based on published models of RBC population dynamics, we have coded a biologically inspired model which allowed us to extract values for biological parameters, including the RBC lifespan. A total of 122 patients were identified, and 1959 laboratory measurements were analyzed. After the pre-treatment RBCs were replaced, the mean MCV increased by 12.6 femtoliter (fL) (95% Bayesian credible interval [CdI] 13-14), the MCHC increased slightly by 0.69 g/dL (95% CdI 0.42-0.96), and the RBC count decreased by 0.77 × 10 These findings suggest that, despite changes in RBC volume, CDK4/6is do not predispose patients to RBC destruction and do not impair regulation of hemoglobin homeostasis.

Our group has developed and validated the use of anti-idiotypic distribution enhancers (AIDEs), which transiently block antibody binding, improving intra-tumoral distribution and efficacy. This study evaluated 1HE and LG1, model anti-trastuzumab AIDEs, in combination with trastuzumab-PE24, a highly potent immunotoxin. The effects of 1HE on the whole-body disposition of radiolabeled trastuzumab were assessed in NCI-N87 tumor-bearing mice. Mechanistic pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) modeling was employed to explore how AIDE binding kinetics influence antibody intra-tumoral distribution and immunotoxin potency. Trastuzumab-PE24 was developed by site-specific conjugation, enabled by self-splicing split intein, with cytotoxicity tested on various cell lines in vitro. The impact of 1HE and LG1 coadministration on trastuzumab-PE24 efficacy was evaluated in NCI-N87 xenograft-bearing mice. 1HE coadministration decreased trastuzumab tumor maximum concentration, reducing tumor terminal slope by 8% and overall tumor exposure by 2.6%, without negatively affecting selectivity. Modeling predicted the optimal AIDE dissociation rate constant for trastuzumab-PE24 to be between 0.015 and 0.3 h AIDE coadministration led to minimal negative impacts on overall tumor exposure, consistent with model simulations. AIDE coadministration improved the efficacy of trastuzumab-PE24 in NCI-N87 xenografts. Modeling further predicted that repeated AIDE administration with trastuzumab-PE24 could induce complete tumor regression. These findings highlight the advantages of the AIDE strategy, particularly when coadministered with highly potent immunotoxins.",,,

The objective of this study is to examine the effect of DSME on different types of costs in older Medicare beneficiaries with diabetes. This was a pooled cross-sectional study using the Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey (MCBS). The use of DSME was reported by survey respondents. Economic outcomes included total medical costs, total diabetes-related medical costs, total prescription costs, and total anti-diabetic prescription costs were measured based on Medicare claims and prescription drug events data from the perspective of the Medicare system. All costs were adjusted to 2012 U.S. dollars using the Consumer Price Index (CPI). Generalized linear models, with a log link and gamma distribution, were used to examine the effect of DSME on different costs. A total of 3,003 older Medicare beneficiaries with diabetes were included, among whom 35.50% (n = 1,066) had DSME. Individuals who did not have DSME had significantly higher total prescription costs than those who had DSME ($4,398.19 vs. $3,966.82, P =.0134).

Pharmaceutical industries and regulatory authorities are continuing to adopt new technologies to improve the efficiency of the drug development process. However, over the decades the pharmaceutical industries were not able to accelerate the drug development process. The pandemic (COVID-19) has taught the pharmaceutical industries and regulatory agencies an expensive lesson showing the need for emergency preparedness by accelerating the drug development process.

The primary endpoint was objective response rate (ORR) per RECIST 1.1 criteria. Among 30 patients enrolled, the median TMB was 10.9 mut/Mb (range: 9-110) and the confirmed objective response rate was 20%. Secondary endpoints included progression-free survival, overall survival, clinical benefit rate, and safety and tolerability, including immune-related adverse events (irAEs). A prespecified correlative outcome was to evaluate the ORR in patients with a TMB ≥ 14 mut/Mb. Patients with TMB ≥ 14 mut/Mb (n = 6) experienced higher response rates (60% vs 12%; p = 0.041) and showed a trend towards improved progression-free survival and overall survival compared to patients with TMB < 14 mut/Mb. Exploratory genomic analyses suggested that ESR1 and PTEN mutations may be associated with poor response, while clinical benefit was associated with a decrease or no change in tumor fraction by serial circulating tumor DNA during treatment. Stool microbiome analysis revealed that baseline blood TMB, PD-L1 positivity, and immune-related diarrhea are associated with distinct taxonomic profiles. In summary, some patients with hypermutated HER2-negative MBC experience extended clinical benefit with a dual immunotherapy regimen; a higher TMB, and additional genomic and microbiome biomarkers may optimize patient selection for therapy with nivolumab plus low-dose ipilimumab.

Here we describe a role for Growth Differentiation Factor 3 (GDF3) on mature adipocyte biology. We find inducible GDF3 loss of function in obese adult mice leads to reduced lipolysis, improved glucose tolerance, and reduced glycemic variability. The effects on lipolysis are driven by lower levels of β3-adrenergic receptor, decreased cAMP and PKA signaling. GDF3 is an ALK5, ALK7, ACVR2A and ACVR2B agonist and also a BMPR2 antagonist. Unlike ALK7 or activin E knockouts, acute GDF3 loss of function does not affect body weight or energy balance but significantly improves metabolic health. These results suggest that blocking GDF3 can improve metabolic health independent of body weight and food intake, an intriguing new model for developing anti-diabetic therapies. Together these results provide much-needed clarity to both the molecular pathways involved in GDF3 signaling and its physiological effects.",,,asbanks@bidmc.harvard.edu.

Vaccines are a lifesaving intervention proven to reduce child mortality from specific diseases. Non-specific effects of vaccines may further affect all-cause child mortality. This analysis explores the association between vaccination status and child survival for children 12-59 months of age, using data from the INSPIRING trial in Jigawa, Nigeria (registration: ISRCTN39213655). Descriptive analysis and logistic regression were used, with multivariate models adjusting for the study design and child age, sex, malnutrition, maternal education, maternal age, compound size and wealth quintile. Interaction effects for child sex were explored given evidence for non-specific effects of vaccines. We found all groups of vaccinated children to have reduced mortality compared to unvaccinated children. Children that completed the Nigerian vaccination schedule, i.e. received the second measles vaccine dose, had the lowest odds of death, with a 70 % reduction in mortality compared to an unvaccinated child (AOR: 0.30, CI: 0.18, 0.49, p-value <0.001).

This study supports evidence that vaccines have non-specific effects on all-cause child mortality. Unvaccinated children had the highest odds of death between 12 and 59 months of age and must be reached through vaccination to improve their chances of survival. In this setting, receiving a second measles vaccine was associated with a large reduction in child mortality, and may be an effective focus for outreach campaigns in Northern Nigeria.",Beard J; ,; Independent Consultant,elizabeth.patrick@alumni.ucl.ac.uk.

Compared with blank control check (CK), the WBM-treated non-waxy foxtail millet flour showed reduced structural ordering, lower enthalpy, improved gelatinization, and produced a more rigid conformation, while the WBM-treated waxy foxtail millet flour showed increased structural ordering, higher enthalpy, lower regrowth, and better viscosity. The results suggest that WBM modifies foxtail millet flour by mechanical action to improve the material quality, which provides a scientific basis for its application in different foxtail millet foods.",,,909479470@qq.com.

However, IMS is a relatively new technology that requires further validation before being accepted by authorities for regulatory compliance of new drugs. In 2020, an international survey was conducted in collaboration with the Imaging Mass Spectrometry Society (IMSS) and the Japan Association for Imaging Mass Spectrometry (JAIMS) to understand the status of IMS and to identify problems with its application. The survey revealed technical challenges in sample preparation, quantitative analysis of drugs in tissues, and data acquisition. Based on the 2020 survey results, we recently conducted a further detailed survey and had discussions within the JAIMS aimed at translating the results into specific experimental procedures and proposing feasible standard methods. This survey involved detailed questions on five themes: sample collection and storage, tissue section preparation, sample preparation, data analysis (including quantitative analysis and data correction methods), and data reproducibility. The questions were answered by JAIMS members working for ten companies.

This study aimed to assess the impact of creatinine clearance (Ccr) on non-hematologic toxicities, including nausea and vomiting, in patients with mCRC treated with TAS-102. This study was conducted as a post-hoc analysis of the JASCC-CINV2001 study, a multicenter observational study of mCRC patients. Using a Cox proportional hazards model, we assessed the relationship between Ccr and nausea or vomiting, and used a generalized estimating equations (GEE) logistic regression model to analyze the association between Ccr and additional toxicities, including fatigue, constipation, diarrhea, insomnia, and dysgeusia. Toxicities were evaluated at weekly intervals over four weeks. Among 100 patients, median Ccr was 80.5 ml/min. The primary analysis showed no significant association between Ccr and nausea or vomiting. However, the secondary analysis revealed a significant link between lower Ccr and the incidence of diarrhea (P = 0.02). These results suggest that although TAS-102-induced nausea and vomiting are not strongly influenced by renal function, decreased renal function increases the risk of diarrhea. Enhanced antiemetic measures may not be necessary for TAS-102 patients with impaired renal function, but monitoring for diarrhea is recommended.",,,iihara.hirotoshi.p7@f.gifu-u.ac.jp.

Pharmacological inhibition of adenosine generation and signaling is an active area of clinical investigation, but only limited clinical benefit has been reported. Here, we show that adenosine suppresses anti-cancer T cell responses following uptake into activated T cells by equilibrative nucleoside transporter 1 (ENT1) and inhibition of de novo pyrimidine nucleotide synthesis. We identify EOS301984 as a potent ENT1 antagonist that restores pyrimidine levels in activated T cells in adenosine-rich environments, resulting in enhanced tumor cell killing by memory T cells and increased ex vivo expansion of functional human tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes. A combination of EOS301984 with anti-PD-1 led to synergistic control of tumor growth in a humanized mouse model of triple-negative breast cancer.

Qualifying prodromal events were defined as attacks with symptoms in which the participant was confident headache would follow within 1-6 h. Of 1,087 screened participants, 477 formed the efficacy analysis population. Outcomes were collected across 48 h showing, for example, at 2 h post-dose, absence of photophobia in 19.5% and 12.5% of ubrogepant- and placebo-treated events, respectively (odds ratio (OR) = 1.72 (95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.13-2.61)); at 3 h post-dose, absence of fatigue occurred in 27.3% and 16.8% (OR = 1.85 (95% CI = 1.17-2.92)) and absence of neck pain in 28.9% and 15.9% (OR = 2.04 (95% CI = 1.25-3.32)) of events; at 4 h post-dose, absence of phonophobia in 50.7% and 35.8% (OR = 1.97 (95% CI = 1.38-2.80)) of events; and at 24 h post-dose, absence of dizziness in 88.5% and 82.3% (OR = 1.82 (95% CI = 1.00-3.30)) of events.

Given the high heritability of psychiatric disorders, psychiatry has potentially much to gain from the application of genomics to identify molecular risk mechanisms and to improve diagnosis. Recent large-scale, genome-wide association studies and sequencing studies, together with advances in functional genomics, have begun to illuminate the genetic architectures of schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and major depressive disorder and to identify potential biological mechanisms.

Semi-solid extrusion (SSE) as a way of 3D printing has shown a substantial potential in personalized medicine for pediatric patients. However, manufacturing tablets through 3D printing is a slow process and might be a bottleneck when many personalized dosages are needed for pediatric use. Here, we use a simplified SSE printing approach for preparing propranolol, spironolactone, and prednisolone tablets (n=144 of each) with different dosages. The quality control approach for the tablets included the development of HPLC methods for each drug based on their physicochemical properties and investigation of mass and content uniformity, stability, and dissolution. The average dosing accuracy of the tablets was 93.1% (propranolol), 96.0% (spironolactone) and 96.7% (prednisolone) showing good mass uniformity. All the formulations showed an appropriate homogeneity (AV<15) and stability up to 9 months. Dissolution results of the tablets were in compliance with acceptance criteria (USP) for immediate release dosage forms, i.e., 80% of drug released within 45 minutes. The osmolality of placebo, propranolol, spironolactone, and prednisolone tablets were 86, 81, 78, and 75 mOsm/kg, respectively. These osmolality values were well below the recommended osmolality of pediatric formulations, i.e., < 450 mOsm/kg. Finally, drug recovery tests via nasogastric tube (NGT) were performed with different reconstitution volumes and temperatures. The drug losses varied between 4-36%.

We aimed to investigate whether a natural product, halofuginone (HF), could overcome NSCLC resistance to EGFR-TKIs by influencing metabolism. In our study, the combination of HF and EGFR-TKI exhibited synergistic cytotoxicity compared to EGFR-TKI monotherapy. The underlying mechanism is that HF promotes the degradation of SP1 protein and decreases the expression of phosphatidylserine transcarbamoylase 1 (PSAT1), which leads to defects in the de novo synthesis of Serine/Glycine and cell death.

In this study, we aimed to investigate the efficacy of water-soluble extract of Rubus coreanus (MN705) in preventing kidney fibrosis in a mouse model of unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO) and in an in vitro model of TGF-β-challenged HK-2 cells. Male C57BL/6 mice (7 weeks old) were randomly assigned to the sham/vehicle (distilled water), sham/MN705 (600 mg/kg/day), UUO/vehicle, UUO/MN705-low dose (300 mg/kg/day), and UUO/MN705-high dose (600 mg/kg/day) groups. After 7 days of pre-treatment, sham or UUO operation was performed, and treatment drugs were administered at the same dose for 7 days. In addition, HK-2 cells and human renal proximal tubular epithelial cells were cultured and challenged with TGF-β (2 ng/ml) with or without an extract of Rubus coreanus (0.05-0.2 mg/ml). In the histopathological specimen of Masson's trichrome stain, areas of kidney interstitial fibrosis were attenuated in the treatment group (10.6 ± 1.3% area vs. 17.2 ± 2.3% area, P < 0.001). In the western blot analysis, protein abundance of α-SMA (12.9 ± 5.9 vs. 19.8 ± 3.1 fold changes compared to sham group, P = 0.046) significantly decreased in the treatment group. In the in vitro experiment, HK-2 cells treated with TGF-β and MN705 showed a dose-dependent significant decrease in the protein expression of fibronectin and phospho-Smad2/3 with increase of MnSOD. The extract of Rubus coreanus attenuates kidney fibrosis in the UUO mouse model and TGF-β-treated human kidney proximal tubular cells.

Our previous work identified that, on Twitter (now X), almost 25% of tweets about the HPV vaccine contain misinformation, and these tweets receive higher audience engagement than accurate tweets. Exposure to misinformation can increase vaccine hesitancy, but the types of misinformation found on social media vary widely, and not all misinformation exposure influences vaccine attitudes and vaccine uptake. Despite the prevalence of misinformation and antivaccine information on social media, little work has assessed parents' assessments of these posts. This study examines which types of misinformation on Twitter parents find the most concerning. In April 2022, we surveyed 263 US parents of children ages 7-10 years using a Qualtrics survey panel. They viewed a first round of 9 randomly selected tweets from a pool of 126 tweets circulating on Twitter that contained misinformation about the HPV vaccine. Then parents selected up to 3 that they found most concerning. The process was repeated once more with 9 selected from the pool of 117 messages not shown in the first round. Using this information, a concern score for each tweet was calculated based on the number of parents who viewed the tweet and selected it as concerning. In total, 2 researchers independently coded the misinformation tweets to identify rhetorical strategies used and health concerns mentioned. Multiple linear regression tested whether tweet content significantly predicted the concern score of the tweet. Parental concern about the different misinformation tweets varied widely, with some misinformation being selected as most concerning just 2.8% of the time it was viewed and other misinformation being selected 79.5% of the time it was viewed. Multiple beta regression analyses found that misinformation tweets using negative emotional appeals (b=.79, P<.001), expressing pharmaceutical company skepticism (b=.36, P=.036), invoking governmental authority (b=.44, P=.02), and mentioning hospitalization (b=1.00, P=.003), paralysis (b=.54, P=.02), and infertility (b=.52, P=.04) significantly increased the percent of parents rating the misinformation tweets as most concerning. Misinformation about HPV vaccination is ubiquitous on social media, and it would be impossible to target and correct all of it. Counter-messaging campaigns and interventions to combat misinformation need to focus on the types of misinformation that concern parents and ultimately may impact vaccine uptake. Results from this study identify the misinformation content that parents find most concerning and provide a useful list of targets for researchers developing interventions to combat misinformation with the goal of increasing HPV vaccine uptake.",,,

There is also concern that bedtime antihypertensive use could induce glaucoma-related visual loss or other hypotensive/ischemic adverse effects. To determine the effect of bedtime vs morning administration of antihypertensive medications on major cardiovascular events and death. Multicenter, open-label, pragmatic randomized clinical trial with blinded end-point assessment and recruitment via 436 primary care clinicians across 5 Canadian provinces inviting their community-dwelling adult patients with hypertension taking at least 1 once-daily antihypertensive medication. Participants were recruited from March 31, 2017, to May 26, 2022, with final follow-up on December 22, 2023. Participants were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to using all once-daily antihypertensive medications either at bedtime (intervention group; n = 1677) or in the morning (control group; n = 1680). The primary outcome was time to first occurrence of all-cause death or hospitalization/emergency department (ED) visit for stroke, acute coronary syndrome, or heart failure. All-cause unplanned hospitalizations/ED visits, and visual, cognitive, and fall- and/or fracture-related safety outcomes were also assessed. A total of 3357 adults (56.4% female; median age, 67 years; 53.7% taking monotherapy) were randomized and followed up for a median of 4.6 years in each treatment group. The composite primary outcome event occurred at a rate of 2.3 per 100 patient-years in the bedtime group and 2.4 per 100 patient-years in the morning group (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.77-1.19; P = .70). Individual components of the primary outcome, all-cause hospitalizations/ED visits, and safety outcomes did not differ between groups. In particular, there was no difference in falls or fractures, new glaucoma diagnoses, or 18-month cognitive decline. Among adults with hypertension in primary care, bedtime administration of antihypertensive medications was safe but did not reduce cardiovascular risk. Antihypertensive medication administration time did not affect the risks and benefits of blood pressure-lowering medication and instead should be guided by patient preferences.

Unanchored MAICs were performed using individual patient-level data (IPD) for all apheresed patients randomized to the cilta-cel arm of CARTITUDE-4 (n = 208) and published arm-level data for EloPd from ELOQUENT-3 (n = 60), IsaKd from IKEMA (lenalidomide-refractory subgroup, n = 57), IsaPd from ICARIA-MM (n = 154), and SVd from BOSTON (lenalidomide-refractory subgroup, n = 53). Eligibility criteria from each comparator trial were applied to the cilta-cel arm IPD, and further imbalances in patient characteristics were adjusted by weighting the cilta-cel patient data to match the reported baseline characteristics of the comparator trials. Comparative efficacy was estimated for overall response rate, very good partial response or better (≥ VGPR) rate, complete response or better (≥ CR) rate, progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS). After adjustment, cilta-cel patients were significantly more likely to achieve an overall response versus EloPd, IsaPd, and SVd, and were significantly more likely to achieve ≥ VGPR and ≥ CR versus all comparators.

The Pharma Collaboration for Transparent Medical Information (phactMI™) benchmarking survey of 35 US pharmaceutical companies was conducted to describe the current landscape and future opportunities of other services Medical Information could provide. In July 2023, an electronic survey containing 57 closed and open-ended questions was distributed to phactMI member companies. The survey questions addressed demographics, medical review, development of materials, training, patient services, insights, and awareness. Medical Information is a significant contributor to the medical review of promotional healthcare provider materials (51%), patient materials (52%), and non-promotional medical materials (45%). Medical Information ensures the accuracy of medical information, fact checks and validates claim accuracy. Fifty percent of the respondents are responsible for reviewing and/or contributing to Medical Affairs material for Field Medical. Additionally, Medical Information trains both Field Medical and Sales teams on the Medical Information function, and to a lesser extent, disease state information. The majority (75%) of Medical Information Departments offer patient information. The vast majority (85%) produce and identify insights. Medical Directors, Field Medical, and Scientific Communications/ Publications often receive shared insights. Fewer individuals integrate insights with Field Medical and Medical Directors. Since 2018, Medical Information activities have seen a rise in advisory board presentations, insights reporting, publications, competitive intelligence, disease state education, surveillance, pathway submission, and labelling activities. Building awareness is still an important aspect of Medical Information and most focus on the development of their Medical Information website. The essential roles and activities of Medical Information Departments support products at every stage. Medical Information participates with multiple functions in evaluating medical materials and there is a growing trend of including Medical Information in the development and review of Medical Affairs materials. Medical Information has expanded its participation in pathway submissions, publications, and labeling activities.

To provide the guidance regarding how to act in future pandemics, we investigated the changes in breast cancer (BC) diagnosis and treatment during the COVID-19 pandemic. The trends of monthly data were calculated in relation to the variables of a total of 291,018 primary BCs registered on the Japanese National Clinical Database between January 2018 and April 2021. An analysis of the nationwide data during the pandemic showed 9% decrease of newly identified BC compared with before the pandemic. The impact was more relevant in the 40-50, 51-60 and 61-70-years age groups (13%, 8% and 9% decrease, respectively). The most substantial reduction was noted in patients identified through screenings without symptoms with a 17% decrease.

A review of literature from the past ten years across PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science focused on immunotherapy strategies. These include immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte therapy, antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs), cancer vaccines, CAR T-cell therapy, and the role of the gut microbiome. While immunotherapy outcomes have improved, particularly for tumor types such as melanoma and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), challenges persist regarding predictive biomarker identification and better management.

Drawing on three varied datasets, we forward a relational approach to medicalization that responds to critiques while aiming to reinvigorate the theory with new concepts and questions. In contrast to prior process-based work, our relational approach argues that medicalization is best understood as an action or activity undertaken by specific groups or actors. We further suggest that unequal relations characterize medicalization. Specifically, we argue that 1) groups or actors receive a benefit from participating in medicalization, which we call the medicalizing dividend and, 2) an actor/group occupies a hegemonic position in medicalizing relations, reaping the largest dividend and constraining other actors. While we assert that pharmaceutical companies are currently hegemonic, we argue that their hegemony is not indefinite. We discuss how our approach facilitates links between medicalization and other theories, while outlining future steps for medicalization research.",,,

To comprehensively unravel the mechanisms of EGFR-TKI resistance, we establish a biobank of patient-derived EGFR-mutant lung cancer organoids, encompassing cases previously treated with EGFR-TKIs. Through comprehensive molecular profiling including single-cell analysis, here we identify a subgroup of EGFR-TKI-resistant LUAD organoids that lacks known resistance-related genetic lesions and instead exhibits a basal-shift phenotype characterized by the hybrid expression of LUAD- and squamous cell carcinoma-related genes. Prospective gene engineering demonstrates that NKX2-1 knockout induces the basal-shift transformation along with EGFR-target therapy resistance. Basal-shift LUADs frequently harbor CDKN2A/B loss and are sensitive to CDK4/6 inhibitors. Our EGFR-mutant lung cancer organoid library not only offers a valuable resource for lung cancer research but also provides insights into molecular underpinnings of EGFR-TKI resistance, facilitating the development of therapeutic strategies.",,,hiroyukiyasuda@keio.jp.

The MANAGE-PD tool ( www.managepd.eu ) was developed to help identify patients with advanced PD and to facilitate treatment decision making and appropriate allocation of patients to device-aided therapies (DAT). This prospective, non-interventional study aimed to investigate the real-world disease burden of PD and treatment optimization after MANAGE-PD implementation. Adult PD patients (N = 278) visited specialist clinics and neurologist's practices in Germany in 2022. Disease burden was assessed using the Unified PD rating scale (UPDRS parts II-IV), the non-motor symptoms scale (NMSS) and the 8-item Parkinson's disease Questionnaire (PDQ-8). Data on planned treatment changes were collected. Data were analyzed by disease control categories according to the MANAGE-PD tool. Mean scores for motor and non-motor symptoms, quality of life, and comorbidity burden were worse in patients with lower disease control measured by MANAGE-PD. For 52.8% of patients in Category 2 (inadequately controlled-might benefit from oral optimization), no change in oral treatment was planned. No change in oral treatment and no DAT initiation was planned for 37.9% and 65.0% of patients in Category 3 (inadequately controlled-might benefit from DAT). Patient refusal and needing more time to decide were the most common reasons for not making treatment changes.

Globally, startups play a significant role in advancing drug discovery. The author's research demonstrated that startups have recently expanded their role to late-entry drug discovery, the area where large pharmaceutical companies traditionally had strength, while maintaining their contribution to first-in-target drug discovery. Despite the growing importance of startups, Japan has faced challenges in fostering successful drug discovery startups, falling particularly behind in leveraging modality technologies. The development of promising startups requires the establishment of a robust startup ecosystem, as seen in the U.S. and certain European countries. Japan's ecosystem for supporting drug discovery startups remains fragile due to factors such as low entrepreneurial activity, limited labor mobility, and insufficient investment capital. The author's research has revealed that in Japan's unlisted drug discovery startups, ""being a corporate spin-off"" and ""having a leader in research and development with prior experience in corporate R&D"" positively impact the startup's valuation and total funding amounts. In Japan, large pharmaceutical companies still account for the majority of new drug discoveries, with a wealth of promising drug discovery seeds and experienced R&D talent accumulated within these corporations. Facilitating the creation of corporate spin-offs that utilize unexploited seeds within large companies and promoting the transfer of corporate talent to startups could strengthen Japan's drug discovery ecosystem. This paper will also explore potential policy measures to encourage these developments.",,,

Antibody-IL-2 fusion proteins capable of preferential tumor localization have shown encouraging signs of activity in clinical trials; however, they typically cause side effects shortly after intravenous administration, which may limit escalation to curative doses. There is an urgent need to engineer IL-2 products with ""activity-on-demand"" able to mask on-target off-tumor IL-2 activity without compromising therapeutic efficacy. To design IL-2 biopharmaceuticals with ""activity-on-demand"", which would be non-toxic on administration but regain activity at the tumor site, we explored the therapeutic potential of the co-administration of signaling inhibitors with matched pharmacokinetic properties. In this work, we used the tumor-homing F8-IL2 fusion protein, specific to a splice variant of fibronectin, and masked off-tumor toxicity by co-administration of upadacitinib, which rapidly clears from circulation. Vascular leak syndrome was monitored by histopathological analysis, the extent of peripheral edema, and cytokine levels. Immune profiling of the tumors and secondary lymphoid organs was performed by flow cytometry. In immunocompetent tumor-bearing mice, the combinatorial treatment significantly improved tolerability without any detectable loss of therapeutic activity, protecting the mice from body weight loss, uncontrolled systemic cytokine release, and severe vascular leak syndrome manifestations, including peripheral edema. F8-IL2 efficiently controlled tumor growth and retained its immunological activity within the neoplastic mass, as evidenced by the massive natural killer and cytotoxic T-cell infiltrates. This study suggests that combinatorial treatments enable the administration of potentially curative doses of targeted IL-2 products while sparing healthy organs from life-threatening toxicities.",Rotta G; Prodi E; Bocci M; Gilardoni E; Comacchio C; Puca E; Neri D; Dakhel Plaza S,Philochem AG,sheila.dakhel@philochem.ch.

PK was characterized by a 2-compartment model with linear elimination and zero-order absorption with lag time. Bioequivalence was met for all steady state exposure metrics for both doses under fasted conditions. A milligram strength for nilotinib tablets ~ 50% lower than that for capsules resulted in bioequivalent nilotinib exposures. Administration with a low-fat meal under modified fasting conditions increased the bioavailability (BA) of 142 mg and 190 mg nilotinib tablets by 26.0% and 29.3%, respectively, vs. fasting; values for 300 mg and 400 mg capsules were 56.8% and 60.7%.

This randomised, double-blind trial across 48 US sites including hospitals, private and group practices, and independent research centres included participants at least 18 years old with pre-existing or high risk for ASVCD or heterozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia with LDL cholesterol concentrations of 1·8 mmol/L (70 mg/dL) or greater despite maximally tolerated lipid-lowering therapy excluding ezetimibe, or having statin intolerance. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1:1:1) to obicetrapib 10 mg plus ezetimibe 10 mg FDC, obicetrapib 10 mg monotherapy, ezetimibe 10 mg monotherapy, or placebo administered daily for 84 days. The co-primary endpoints in the intention-to-treat population were the percent LDL cholesterol changes in the FDC group compared with placebo, ezetimibe monotherapy, and obicetrapib monotherapy, and the placebo-adjusted change in the obicetrapib monotherapy group. The trial was prospectively registered (NCT06005597) and is completed. Between March 4 and July 3, 2024, 407 participants were randomly assigned.

Altered serotonergic neurotransmission is linked to conditions such as anxiety, depression, anorexia, migraine, insomnia, schizophrenia, Alzheimer's disease (AD), and cognitive impairments. The 5-HT6 receptor (5-HT6R), mainly found in brain regions involved in cognition, is a promising therapeutic target for cognitive deficits in neuropsychiatric disorders, particularly AD and schizophrenia. Preclinical studies have shown that 5-HT6R antagonists improve cognitive function. 5-HT6R interacts dynamically with an extensive intracellular protein network, regulating the localisation, trafficking, and signalling of these proteins. Proteomic and genetic studies have revealed interactions with mTOR kinase and neurofibromin, both of which are crucial for synaptic plasticity, learning, and memory. Fyn kinase is also associated with 5-HT6Rs, reinforcing receptor expression and G-protein coupling. Notably, the G protein-regulated inducer of neurite outgrowth 1 (GPRIN1) interacts with 5-HT6Rs independently of agonists, enhancing receptor activity. This review highlights the clinical testing of 5-HT6R ligands as regulators of these complex signalling properties, underscoring their therapeutic potential in addressing cognitive impairments associated with neuropsychiatric disorders.",De Deurwaerdère P,Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique,

Metabolic dysfunctions, particularly type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), have been implicated in AD pathogenesis, highlighting the potential for novel therapeutic approaches targeting shared underlying mechanisms. Here, we investigate sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibition as a therapeutic strategy for AD using Enavogliflozin, a potent SGLT2 inhibitor, in the 5XFAD mouse model. Five-month-old 5XFAD mice were treated with Enavogliflozin (0.1 or 1 mg/kg) or vehicle for 8 weeks. The higher dose significantly improved cognitive performance in Y-maze and Morris Water Maze tests, which correlated with enhanced synaptic plasticity and increased acetylcholine levels. Moreover, Enavogliflozin treatment reduced Aβ pathology and plaque burden, particularly affecting larger plaques. Mechanistically, SGLT2 inhibition attenuated neuroinflammation by suppressing NF-κB signaling and proinflammatory cytokine production while promoting microglial recruitment to plaques. In vitro and ex vivo analyses further revealed that Enavogliflozin enhances microglial phagocytic capacity via AMPK-mediated mitochondrial biogenesis and function. These findings highlight the multifaceted neuroprotective effects of SGLT2 inhibition in AD, demonstrating its potential to mitigate pathology and improve cognitive function. By uncovering its impact on neuroinflammation and microglial function, this study establishes SGLT2 inhibition as a promising therapeutic avenue for AD and other neurodegenerative disorders.",,,

This study examines the impact of the conflict on a less publicized sector of Sudan's health system: the national pharmaceutical manufacturing and supply chain. Research interviews were conducted with representatives of 4 companies engaged in pharmaceutical manufacturing and/or supply in Sudan, in addition to a review of primary information from medical regulators and industry associations. Based on these interviews, 3 case studies are presented; insights from the fourth interview inform the study overall. All 4 companies reported significant impacts on their operations, as well as on other companies in the pharmaceutical sector. Domestic pharmaceutical manufacturing has effectively come to a halt, leading to the non-availability of certain drugs in parts of the country. Manufacturers have shifted course to focus on imports, but heavy losses of domestically stored inventory and an inability to distribute medicines to large parts of the country have had a significant impact on pharmaceutical supply to retail pharmacies, public and private sector health facilities, and the National Medical Supplies Fund (NMSF).

Detailed data on optimal postoperative follow-up evaluation of cStage I ESCC are lacking. This study aimed to evaluate the frequency, characteristics, and predictors of postoperative recurrence in patients with cT1bN0M0 cStage I ESCC. The study analyzed 210 patients who underwent surgery for cT1bN0M0 cStage I ESCC and a follow-up computed tomography (CT) examination in the prospective multicenter study, JCOG0502. The study categorized the characteristics of postoperative recurrences such as the recurrence sites and whether regional/non-regional lymph nodes (LNs) and single/multiple organs were involved. Backward elimination was applied (p < 0.2) to identify postoperative recurrence predictors and obtained hazard ratios (HRs) based on Fine and Gray's model. Postoperative recurrence was experienced by 31 patients (14.8%) at one or more of the following sites: regional LNs (n = 18), non-regional LNs (n = 10), lung (n = 2); bone (n = 2), and liver, local recurrence, skin, pleura, pericardium, and other (n = 1 each). In four patients, the first recurrence developed in multiple organs. The median interval between trial registration and the first recurrence was 18.6 months. In multivariable analyses, pathologic nodal metastasis (hazard ratio [HR], 3.29; p = 0.003), tumor location in the upper-thoracic esophagus versus lower-thoracic esophagus (HR, 6.71; p = 0.013), and two-field lymphadenectomy (HR, 4.31; p = 0.001) were independently associated with the development of postoperative recurrence.

Its main difficulty lies in the strong repulsion between the lone pair electrons on the N and O atoms, which makes their N─O bond easy to break, leading to a over-reduction to amine compounds. Here, we present a green electrocatalytic strategy for the first time that converts oximes to hydroxylamines over CuS. Specially, N-benzylhydroxylamine was achieved with 95% conversion and 80% selectivity from benzaldoxime at -0.9 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode. Mechanistic investigations reveal that CuS can optimize the adsorption energy of the reaction intermediates, making the N─O bond more difficult to cleave during the electrocatalytic hydrogenation, thus leading to a high selectivity formation of hydroxylamines. This methodology is successfully extended to other hydroxylamines and further enables the unprecedented synthesis of organic hydroxylamines from nitric oxide gas. Our work establishes a sustainable electrosynthetic platform for hydroxylamines synthesis without organic solvents and additional reduction agents, providing new insights for modern green chemical synthesis.",,,

We found that LOG improved zebrafish cardiac function and mitigated the upregulation of CK-MB, cTnT, nppa, and nppb caused by DOX. Moreover, LOG suppressed the high levels of ROS, GSSG, and MDA in response to DOX and increased GSH activity and gpx4 levels in zebrafish. Additionally, LOG increased cell viability and the GSH/GSSG ratio, reduced oxidative damage and the accumulation of ferrous ions, and maintained mitochondrial function in H9C2 cells. Mechanistically, LOG improved the abnormal expression of key genes in the PPAR signaling pathway and ferroptosis induced by DOX. In conclusion, our study emphasized that LOG attenuates DIC by mitigating oxidative stress-triggered lipid peroxidation related to the inhibition of PPAR-mediated ferroptosis.",,,xjguodd@163.com.

Similarly, patients with moderate-to-severe EPVS in the basal ganglia region had a significantly poor clinical outcome at 90 days (51.7 % vs 18.3 %, P=0.001). Moderate to severe basal ganglia EPVS (OR=2.661, 95 %CI: 1.070-6.618, P=0.035), hyperlipidemia (OR=3.011, 95 %CI: 1.147-7.902, P=0.025) and a higher baseline NIHSS score before thrombolysis (OR=1.194, 95 %CI: 1.071-1.331, P=0.001) were independent risk factors for poor clinical outcome at 90 days. Early neurological improvement (OR=0.220, 95 %CI 0.093-0.520, P=0.001) was associated with a reduced risk of poor clinical outcomes at 90 days. Moderate-to-severe EPVS in basal ganglia were an independent risk factor for poor clinical outcome at 90 days in AIS patients with intravenous thrombolysis. Therefore, the severity of EPVS in the basal ganglia region can serve as an imaging marker to predict the 90-day clinical outcome of AIS patients treated with intravenous thrombolysis.",,,g200026@163.com.

Many radiomic features derived from computed tomography (CT) are sensitive to variations across scanners, reconstruction settings, and acquisition protocols. In this phantom study, eight different CT reconstruction parameters were varied to explore image- and feature-level harmonization approaches to improve tissue classification. Varying reconstructions of an anthropomorphic radiopaque phantom containing three lesion categories (metastasis, hemangioma, and benign cyst) and normal liver tissue were used for evaluating two harmonization methods and their combination: (i) generative adversarial networks (GANs) at the image level; (ii) ComBat at the feature level, and (iii) a combination of (i) and (ii). A total of 93 texture and intensity features were extracted from each tissue class before and after image-level harmonization and were also harmonized at the feature level. Reproducibility and stability were assessed via the Concordance Correlation Coefficient (CCC) and pairwise comparisons using paired stability tests. The ability of features to discriminate between tissue classes was assessed by measuring the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. The global reproducibility and discriminative power were assessed by averaging over the entire dataset and across all tissue types. ComBat improved reproducibility by 31.58% and stability by 5.24%, while GAN increased reproducibility by 8% it reduced stability by 4.33%. Classification analysis revealed that ComBat increased average AUC by 15.19%, whereas GAN decreased AUC by 2.56%. While GAN qualitatively enhances image harmonization, ComBat provides superior statistical improvements in feature stability and classification performance, highlighting the importance of robust feature-level harmonization in radiomics.",,,

Here, we examine the healthcare resource use (HCRU) and costs of aHO following treatment of these tumors. We used a retrospective matched cohort design with German statutory health insurance data on 5.42 million people from 2010 to 2021. We applied a novel three-step approach using diagnostic and prescription data to identify patients with treatment- or tumor-related (TTR)-aHO. We measured HCRU and costs across hospitalizations, outpatient visits, visits per specialist group, and outpatient prescription medications. Compared to non-HO obesity, TTR-aHO is associated with increased hospitalizations, increased outpatient physician visits, and increased prescription use in the two years after incident tumor surgery/radiotherapy. Excess costs of TTR-aHO are €19,900 per patient in the first year and €10,700 in the second, driven by inpatient costs. Cost-intensive hormone replacement therapies like somatropin lead to a sharp increase in prescription costs in the second year. This study provides the first real-world analysis of TTR-aHO economics, emphasizing the importance of HCRU and costs for decision-making. Previously, economic evaluations have been missing due to the lack of a standard method to identify patients with aHO in retrospective studies. Using a new identification approach, the study reveals that TTR-aHO poses a significant burden in extensive treatment requirements for patients and high related costs for the healthcare system.",Witte J; Touchot N; Surmann B; Braegelmann K; Flume M,Vandage GmbH; Rhythm Pharmaceuticals; Gene Access GmbH,kylie.braegelmann@vandage.de.

The aim of this study is to evaluate the relationship between equol production and the gut microbiota in school-age children, with consideration of sex, age, and exposure to soy isoflavones. Participants were 1110 students aged 7-8, 10-11 and 13-14 years. The cumulative participation rate was 85.2%. Equol production, defined as a log-transformed equol/daidzein ratio of -1.75 or greater, was determined in urine collected after two days of soymilk supplementation. Urinary daidzein, genistein, and equol were measured by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. The microbiota in 223 fecal samples was determined by 16S rRNA gene sequencing analysis. The observed operational taxonomic unit number, Chao 1, and Shannon index were significantly higher in equol producers than in non-producers after adjustments for survey time, sex, and age. Principal coordinate analysis plots based on weighted and unweighted UniFrac distances showed significant differences in the gut microbiota between equol producers and non-producers. Among the species with an average abundance of ≥0.1%, several species were more abundant in equol producers than in non-producers, with significant positive correlations between relative abundances and equol/daidzein ratios. Of species previously reported as equol-producing, Asaccharobacter celatus and Slackia isoflavoniconvertens were significantly associated with equol production. Equol production was strongly associated with the diversity of the gut microbiota.

Recent advancements in research techniques, including manual and automated patch clamp (APC) electrophysiology, solid-supported membrane-based electrophysiology (SSME), and fluorescence-based ion imaging, have further enhanced our ability to investigate lysosomal ion channels and transporters in both physiological and pathological conditions, spurring drug discovery efforts. Several pharmaceutical companies are now developing therapies aimed at modulating these channels and transporters to improve lysosomal function in disease. Small molecules targeting channels like transient receptor potential mucolipin (TRPML) 1 and TMEM175, as well as drugs modulating lysosomal pH, are currently in preclinical and clinical development. This review provides an overview of the role of lysosomal ion channels and transporters in health and disease, highlights the cutting-edge techniques used to study them, and discusses the therapeutic potential of targeting these channels and transporters in the treatment of various diseases.

The newly developed PREVENT equations offers several advantages for short and long-term cardiovascular risk prediction. To determine how often PREVENT equations identify increased cardiovascular risk among young adults who experience premature myocardial infarction compared with existing risk calculators. The YOUNG-MI registry is a retrospective cohort from two large academic centers, which included individuals who experienced an MI at age ≤ 50 years. Study physicians adjudicated diagnosis of Type 1 MI. Cardiovascular risk was estimated by pooled cohort equations and PREVENT equations based on data available prior to MI or at the time of presentation. The study cohort included 1149 individuals with a median age of 45 years and 19 % women. The median 10-year ASCVD risk calculated by pooled cohort equations and 2023 PREVENT equations was 4.6 % and 2.3 %, respectively. Using the 10-year ASCVD risk estimates from the 2023 PREVENT equations, only 33 (3 %) individuals met the 7.5 % threshold while 93 (8 %) met the 5 % threshold and 333 (29 %) met the 3 % threshold. For 30-year ASCVD risk using PREVENT, 827 (72 %) met a threshold of ≥ 10 %. The PREVENT equations may lead to undertreatment of young adults who experienced an MI.

Therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) refers to the measurement of clozapine concentration. Clozapine TDM can be used to optimize treatment, particularly by identifying pharmacokinetic interactions between clozapine and comedications. We identified 5 cases of patients with available clozapine concentrations who were concomitantly receiving nifedipine and clozapine. These cases were drawn from 2 independent datasets: 2 from a double-blind, randomized clinical trial in the United States and 3 from a German TDM naturalistic database. As an index of clozapine clearance, we used the trough-level concentration-to-dose (C/D) ratios to estimate the minimum therapeutic doses. To estimate dose-correction factors for nifedipine treatment, we included only clozapine concentrations at steady state. We divided the clozapine minimum therapeutic doses (MTD) from the on-condition by the off-nifedipine condition. In 4 patients, the ratio of on/off nifedipine for MTD ranged between 0.58 and 0.82. Another patient had no data and had to be compared with published control data (female smoker of African ancestry), providing a correction factor of 0.52 after eliminating 5 concentrations contaminated by the development of obesity. In the absence of access to TDM, when prescribing nifedipine to clozapine-treated patients, we recommend reducing the daily dose of clozapine by one-third because of the weak inhibition of clozapine metabolism. With access to TDM, TDM should guide dosing as unusual patients may need larger dose reductions, as it is possible that in some patients, nifedipine may be a moderate inhibitor requiring halving clozapine dose. Further prospective studies are warranted.",Paulzen M,Alexianer Centre for Mental Health Aachen/Gangelt.,

Although this combination is highly effective, acquired resistance commonly occurs. MCL-1, a BCL-2 family molecule, is frequently upregulated in VEN-resistant cells, playing a major role in VEN resistance. Previously, we demonstrated that (R)-WAC-224 is effective against AML with minimal cardiac toxicity. (R)-WAC-224 combined with VEN demonstrated strong antileukemia effects on VEN-resistant AML cells overexpressing MCL-1 in vitro. Gene expression profiles revealed that (R)-WAC-224 with VEN induced DNA damage pathways leading to cell apoptosis. (R)-WAC-224 elicited caspase 3 activation, which cleaved MCL-1; this effect was reversed by a caspase inhibitor, thus overcoming VEN resistance. A combination of azacitidine (AZA), a hypomethylating agent, VEN, and (R)-WAC-224 was highly effective against VEN-resistant AML in vivo without increasing toxicity.

We hypothesized that baseline and early-on-treatment (EOT) parameters may help identify patients likely to have primary refractory disease. We considered baseline and EOT variables measured up to 5 weeks after initiating therapy in the phase 3 clinical trial IMvigor211, which compared atezolizumab versus chemotherapy, in muC patients who had progressed on platinum-based chemotherapy. We used least absolute shrinkage and selection operator-regularized logistic regression models to predict the risk of primary refractory disease employing clinical and laboratory variables. 902 patients were evaluable for analysis. Our baseline model achieves an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.730, 0.717 for the atezolizumab group and 0.696 for the chemotherapy group. The AUC increases to 0.848 overall with EOT parameters, 0.871 for the atezolizumab group and 0.788 for the chemotherapy group. The EOT model suggests that 33.7% of patients receiving atezolizumab may benefit from switching to chemotherapy, reducing their risk of primary refractoriness from 67.1% to 51.5%. Our prediction model employs readily available and routinely measured clinical and laboratory factors, such as urine-specific gravity, presence of liver metastases, and total protein and erythrocyte counts. It robustly identifies patients with early primary refractory disease to atezolizumab before clinical progression and may inform therapeutic decisions.

Although there have been significant advances in RA treatment over the past two decades, approximately 40% of patients do not respond to first-line biological disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (bDMARDs). Physicians often use an empirical, trial-and-error approach to select bDMARDs to treat patients with RA. This is inefficient and can be costly for healthcare systems which have limited resources. Unlike in oncology, where molecular pathology helps guide targeted therapies, reliable, predictive biomarkers for drug response in RA are yet to be identified. This narrative review aims to summarise current knowledge on novel biomarkers of disease activity and drug response in RA, with a particular focus on serum cytokine profiles and macrophage and fibroblast subsets in synovial tissue. We also highlight key areas of further research that could advance the development of targeted therapies for patients with RA. We searched PubMed to identify studies pertaining to biomarkers of disease activity and drug response in the treatment of RA. We present a detailed overview of the key studies that have identified serum cytokine profiles and synovial macrophage and fibroblast subsets as novel biomarkers of disease activity and drug response in RA. A novel, evidence-based approach to precision medicine in RA, which involves tailoring treatment based on cytokine profiles and synovial tissue signatures, shows promise for improving patient care. However, more research is needed to identify biomarkers that predict drug response.",Avouac J,Service de Rhumatologie,jerome.avouac@aphp.fr.
40338870,"The effect of supply chain risks management practices on operational performance of pharmaceutical manufacturing companies in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia: Analytical cross-sectional study.",2025-05-08,PloS one,10.1371/journal.pone.0321311,"The efficient movement of pharmaceuticals through various stakeholders to reach customers in the appropriate quantity and at the right time is achieved through supply chain management. However, the intricate nature of supply chain processes poses tremendous supply chain risks and jeopardizing pharmaceutical manufacturing company's ability. Failure to address these risks can hinder the provision of high-quality health services. However, effective supply chain risk management can foster more resilient and efficient global supply chains. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the effect of pharmaceutical supply chain risks management practices on operational performance of pharmaceutical manufacturing companies in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. Analytical cross-sectional study complemented with qualitative method was conducted at pharmaceutical manufacturing companies in Addis Ababa between May-August 2023. One hundred seventy two staffs working in four manufacturing companies included in the study. For quantitative part, pretested a self-administered five-point Likert scale questionnaire was used and analyzed using SPSS® -version 26. Assumptions of linear multivariate regression were checked and the level of significance determined at a 95% CI and p-value <0.05. Nine face to face in-depth interviews with key informants were conducted to gather the qualitative data, and the data were analyzed using thematic analysis technique. The study included 172 employees from four manufacturing companies, with a response rate of 97%. The regression analysis revealed that demand (β=-0.191, t = -4.162, p < 0.05) and supply side risks (β=-0.131, t = -2.015, p < 0.05) have a negative effect on the operational performance of manufacturing companies. Holding other variables constant, a one-unit increase in demand and supply side risks results in 19.1% and 13.1% lead to decrease in operational performance of manufacturing companies, respectively. Increasing costs of freight, shortage and fluctuating foreign exchange rate for currency, lack of logistics expertise and organized risks mitigation team were the major challenges for manufacturing company's operational performance. Demand and supply side risks affected the supply chain performance of the manufacturing companies. Furthermore, the increasing costs of freight, shortage of foreign currency, lack of logistics expertise and organized risk mitigation team were the main bottleneck for pharmaceutical manufacturing company's performance. The study result suggests demand and supply side risks, increasing costs of freight; shortage foreign currency exchange rate and lack of logistics expertise in companies should be given attention by stakeholders to improve operational performance. Furthermore, understanding these risk factors can improve the operational performance of the pharmaceutical industry by influencing policy and industry practices in the larger framework of global supply chain risk management not only one country.",,,

A descriptive design was used. Initially, pre education questionnaires were distributed to nurses in the preoperative unit during a monthly department meeting to assess their existing knowledge. This was followed by an educational presentation detailing the effects of preoperative anxiety on surgical outcomes, its manifestations in patients, and various anxiety assessment tools. Subsequently, two post education questionnaires were administered at different intervals to gauge the improvement in knowledge and the effectiveness of the educational intervention. The project identified a significant knowledge gap among preoperative nurses regarding the tools and standardization needed for effective anxiety assessment. The educational intervention successfully enhanced nurses' understanding and assessment practices related to preoperative anxiety. This project highlighted the importance of proper anxiety assessment in the preoperative period and provided a foundation for potential practice changes aimed at improving patients' surgical experiences through better management of preoperative anxiety.",,,nmasdalessandro@metrohealth.org.
40338447,The curse of blood-brain barrier and blood-tumor barrier in malignant brain tumor treatment.,,International journal of clinical oncology,10.1007/s10147-025-02777-3,"The blood-brain barrier (BBB) is crucial for brain homeostasis but is a major obstacle in delivering anticancer drugs to brain tumors. However, this perspective requires re-evaluation, particularly for malignant brain tumors, such as gliomas and brain metastases. In these aggressive tumors, the BBB undergoes significant alterations, leading to the formation of a more permeable blood-tumor barrier. While this increased permeability allows better drug penetration, heterogeneity in blood-tumor barrier (BTB) integrity across different tumor regions remains a challenge. Additionally, the main challenge in treating brain tumors lies not in BBB penetration but in the lack of effective drugs. Conventional chemotherapies, including temozolomide and nitrosourea agents, have shown limited efficacy, and resistance mechanisms often reduce their long-term benefits. The ""BBB curse"" has often been blamed for the slow progress in drug development. However, emerging evidence suggests that even larger-molecule therapies, such as antibody-drug conjugates, can successfully target brain tumors. This review aims to critically reassess the roles of the BBB and BTB in brain tumor therapy, highlighting their impact on drug delivery and evaluating the current landscape of chemotherapeutic strategies. Furthermore, it explores new approaches to overcome treatment limitations, emphasizing the need for personalized and targeted therapeutic strategies.",,,yonarita@ncc.go.jp.

The Government of China has introduced the National Drug Price Negotiation (NDPN) policy to mitigate the high costs of anticancer drugs, especially multi-indication drugs, aimed at improving patient access to effective treatments. In this retrospective study, we examined 24 multi-indication anticancer drugs for solid tumours included in the National Reimbursement Drug List (NRDL) between 2016 and 2023. We collected characteristics of indication, clinical trial evidence, and clinical benefits of these drugs, calculated monthly drug costs, and assessed the associations the two by regression and correlation analyses. We observed a significant reduction in the median monthly drug cost from USD 3863.08 before NDPN to USD 732.91 after their inclusion in the NRDL. However, the correlation analyses showed no significant relationships between drug costs and characteristics of indications, clinical trial evidence, and clinical benefits, while American Society of Clinical Oncology Value Framework scores demonstrated a negative correlation with costs, indicating that pricing may not accurately reflect clinical benefits. While we found that the NDPN policy has significantly reduced drug costs, we did not observe a significant correlation between costs and specific characteristics. This highlights a need for a more transparent pricing mechanism linked to clinical efficacy to improve the accessibility and affordability of cancer therapies that effectively balance the interests of pharmaceutical companies, patients, and health insurance funds.",,,
40338322,New drugs and their performance 10 years after approval: a systematic analysis.,,Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's archives of pharmacology,10.1007/s00210-025-04178-9,"More than 10,000 drugs are available on today's market in Germany, with an increasing number receiving institutional approval every year. However, their general efficacy and utility for patients are often not thoroughly analyzed and, in some cases, remain questionable. The lack of systematic analysis for these parameters hinders learning from failures and successes. As a result, there is a risk of wasting resources by the pharmaceutical industry and approving new drugs that offer no additional benefit to patients in need of innovative treatments. Therefore, we set out to analyze the evolution of new drugs with innovative principles over 10 years after approval by the European Medicines Agency (EMA). We focused on drugs approved from 2004 to 2011, excluding protein kinase inhibitors and monoclonal antibodies, and identified 190 new drugs using the Arzneiverordnungsreport (AVR, Drug prescription report). With data from the Wissenschaftliches Institut der Ortskrankenkassen (WidO, Scientific Institute of the General Local Health Insurance Fund, AOK), we analyzed their number of prescriptions, sales, defined daily doses (DDD), and daily costs. We then extended our analysis with a focus on Rote-Hand-Briefe (RHB, Direct Healthcare Professional Communication). We identified factors of success, which was defined as a drug appearing in the top 3000. We then conducted a detailed analysis of outliers in terms of sales, focusing on parameters such as indications, innovation regarding their mechanism of action, relative costs, competition, pharmacological properties, and clinical studies. The analysis of both the most and least successful, allowed us to identify clear correlations and determine potential red flags as well as green flags regarding pharmaceutical sales. Nearly half (49%) of the drugs analyzed met our success criterion, most very early (66% within the first 2 years). Most of these drugs also showed a notable progression in the drug rankings over the years. Thirty percent of all analyzed drugs received RHBs, with most of them (84% of the said 30%) receiving at least one deemed potentially influential regarding sales. The successful drugs were more often subject to these potentially influential RHBs than their non-successful counterparts, and most of the potentially influential RHBs were related to adverse drug reactions (53%) or indications or contraindications (14.8%). Based on the analysis of the tops and flops, we conclude that market success, measured by sales, is influenced by multiple factors. These include indication(s), innovation, the competitive landscape, costs, and pharmacological aspects as well as studies regarding the efficacy and the adverse drug reactions of the drug. These results underline the necessity of a multifactorial approach based on value-adding to assess potential new drugs by pharmaceutical companies.",,,seifert.roland@mh-hannover.de.

Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the most common type; most cases are advanced/metastatic at diagnosis. Available first and second lines of treatment include platinum-based chemotherapeutics, therapies targeting driver oncogene mutations, and immune checkpoint inhibitors, with limited options at later lines. Understanding the current treatment landscape to define unmet needs will benefit research and development of novel therapies for advanced/metastatic NSCLC. The LUMINATE-101 retrospective cohort study evaluated real-world treatment patterns and outcomes for patients with non-squamous epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) wild type (WT) advanced/metastatic NSCLC diagnosed 1 January 2017 to 31 August 2022 that progressed on previous therapies. Patient data were pooled from US-based electronic health records-derived databases: Flatiron Health NSCLC real-world, ConcertAI Patient360 Lung Cancer, and ConcertAI RWD360NLP; redundant records were removed using tokenization. Overall, 620 patients were included; median age 67 years, >34% ECOG performance status ≥2, 19% had brain metastasis, 10% had liver metastasis, and 91% were current/ex-smokers.

This study aimed to investigate the complementary effects of combination therapy with pioglitazone (PIO) and empagliflozin (EMPA) on MASLD in individuals with type 2 diabetes. In a randomized, open-label trial, 50 participants with type 2 diabetes and MASLD were assigned 1:1:1 to receive PIO 15 mg, EMPA 10 mg, or a combination (PIO 15 mg plus EMPA 10 mg) daily for 24 weeks. Liver fat fraction and stiffness were evaluated using magnetic resonance imaging-proton density fat fraction (MRI-PDFF) and magnetic resonance elastography (MRE), respectively. Combination therapy resulted in the largest reduction in liver fat and stiffness among treatment groups. Participants experiencing a relative reduction ≥ 30% or an absolute reduction ≥ 5% in liver fat were the most prevalent in the combination group (100.0% vs. 57.1% in PIO and 87.5% in EMPA, p = 0.010). In addition, the combination group showed the highest proportion of individuals with a relative reduction ≥ 30% in liver fat and ≥ 20% in liver stiffness than the monotherapy groups (50.0% vs. 21.4% in PIO and 6.3% in EMPA, p = 0.029). Combination therapy did not induce the changes in subcutaneous fat deposition observed in the monotherapy groups, but it did show the most substantial reduction in visceral fat, concurrently showing the largest increase in adiponectin level across the three groups (p = 0.036). Combination therapy of PIO with EMPA showed synergistic benefits for MASLD in individuals with type 2 diabetes, compensating for the inadequate or unfavorable effects of monotherapies; ClincialTrials.gov number, NCT03646292.

This analysis of the cross-sectional, population-based, nationwide online survey included adults with migraine. Respondents reported their experiences with prescription and OTC drugs for migraine, migraine-specific drug awareness, and attitude towards migraine. Subgroup analyses were performed based on the number of monthly headache days (MHD) and the frequency of OTC drug use/month. The 19,590 respondents with migraine (68.8% female; mean [SD] age 40.5 [13.1] years) had mean (SD) 3.5 (5.2) MHDs; 29.0% consulted doctors in the past year for migraine. OTC drug use in the past year was common (≥ 62.1%) regardless of doctor consultation or number of MHDs. Among respondents who answered that they would usually use prescribed drugs when they have a migraine attack, 35.2% reported that they would typically use OTC drugs too. The frequency of OTC drug use was the same or higher than that of prescribed drugs in 51.3% of the respondents who consulted doctors in the past year. Only 14.6% of respondents discussed OTC drugs with doctors during consultations in the past year. Migraine-specific drug access and awareness were limited even among frequent OTC drug users (≥ 10 days/month); 18.2% used triptans, but 65.5% never heard of it. Among 37.1% of respondents who had hesitated to visit a doctor, 'I could handle it myself with OTC medicine' was the most common reason for hesitation (34.9%). OTC drug use is common among people with migraine; however, it is not frequently discussed with doctors. Many respondents, even those with frequent OTC drug use, did not have access or awareness of migraine-specific drugs.

However, it is crucial to understand these effects to interpret the results of cross-sectional and longitudinal studies in medicated patients and, ultimately, to understand better the biological mechanisms driving antipsychotics' effects. In this work, we aim to determine whether exposure to antipsychotics is associated with alterations in brain MRI structural metrics in the absence of disease effects. A randomized, double-blind, counter-balanced order, crossover, placebo-controlled study in healthy volunteers was performed. The study comprised two arms. Within arms, participants were randomized to receive daily doses of either the active compound (Arm 1= amisulpride 400 mg/day, N = 24; Arm 2= aripiprazole 10 mg/day, N = 24) for one week, followed by placebo or vice versa. We found increased MRI volume estimates in the left putamen and in the right caudate in the amisulpride condition as compared to placebo and increased right putamen volume estimates after aripiprazole compared to placebo. No other effects were found in cortical volume estimates, cortical thickness, cortical surface area, and T1-relaxation time. Striatal changes reversed within weeks of drug withdrawal. Short-term exposure to either one of two different antipsychotics results in a transient increase in striatal volume measured with T1-weighted MRI that normalizes rapidly on stopping treatment without cortical changes. Our findings suggest that striatal volumetric MRI differences detected in people with schizophrenia taking antipsychotics are, at least in part, attributable to pharmacological effects.",Wall MB,Invicro,pierluigi.selvaggi@kcl.ac.uk.

TYK2 missense mutations protect against type 1 diabetes (T1D), and inhibition of TYK2 shows promise in other autoimmune conditions. We evaluated the effects of specific TYK2 inhibitors (TYK2is) in pre-clinical models of T1D, including human β cells, cadaveric islets, iPSC-derived islets, and mouse models. In vitro studies showed that TYK2is prevented IFNα-induced β cell HLA class I up-regulation, endoplasmic reticulum stress, and chemokine production. In co-culture studies, pre-treatment of β cells with TYK2i prevented IFNα-induced antigenic peptide presentation and alloreactive and autoreactive T cell degranulation. In vivo administration of BMS-986202 in two mouse models of T1D (RIP-LCMV-GP and NOD mice) reduced systemic and tissue-localised inflammation, prevented β cell death, and delayed T1D onset. Transcriptional phenotyping of pancreatic islets, pancreatic lymph nodes, and spleen highlighted a role for TYK2 inhibition in modulating signalling pathways associated with inflammation, translational control, stress signalling, secretory function, immunity, and diabetes. Additionally, TYK2i treatment changed the composition of innate and adaptive immune cell populations in the blood and disease target tissues. These findings indicate that TYK2i has beneficial effects on both the immune and endocrine compartments in models of T1D, thus supporting a path forward for testing TYK2is in human T1D.

While naked exRNAs can be spontaneously internalized by certain cells, functional cytosolic delivery has been rarely observed. Here, we show that extracellular ribonucleases (RNases)-primarily from cell culture supplements-have obscured the study of exRNA functionality. When ribonuclease inhibitor (RI) is added to cell cultures, naked exRNAs can trigger pro-inflammatory responses in dendritic cells and macrophages, largely via endosomal Toll-like receptors (TLRs). Moreover, naked exRNAs can escape endosomes, engaging cytosolic RNA sensors. In addition, naked extracellular mRNAs can be spontaneously internalized and translated by various cell types in an RI-dependent manner. In vivo, RI co-injection amplifies naked-RNA-induced activation of splenic lymphocytes and myeloid leukocytes. Furthermore, naked RNA is inherently pro-inflammatory in RNase-poor compartments like the peritoneal cavity. These findings demonstrate that naked RNA is bioactive without requiring vesicular encapsulation, making a case for nonvesicular-exRNA-mediated intercellular communication.",,,msegovia@pasteur.edu.uy.

More recently, GBA1 mutations have been identified as the most prevalent genetic risk factor for Parkinson's disease (PD), associated with more pronounced symptoms characterized by earlier onset and accelerated cognitive decline. In these GBA-associated PD patients the α-synuclein pathology is more prominent, and recent data suggest a link between α-synucleinopathies and GBA1 mutations. Here, we explored the effect of GBA1 gene supplementation on the GD phenotypes and α-synuclein pathology by using the adeno-associated virus (AAV) system. We have compared two AAV serotypes, AAV5 and AAV9, and two different ubiquitous promoters, and demonstrate that both promoters work efficiently albeit not the same in vitro and in vivo. GBA1 overexpression reduces the accumulation of glucosylsphingosine (GlcSph) and restores motor dysfunction in a GD mouse model. We further demonstrate that GBA1 overexpression can dissolve phospho-α-synuclein aggregation induced by the addition of α-synuclein pre-formed fibril (PFF) in a mouse primary neuron model suggesting the direct effect of β-Glucocerebrosidase (GCase) on α-synuclein accumulation. In vivo, we show that GCase inhibition can induce insoluble high-molecular-weight α-synuclein aggregation and that delivery of GBA1 achieves robust reduction of the α-synuclein aggregates in the mouse brain. In summary, GCase expression not only reduces GlcSph, but also restores GD motor dysfunction and removes α-synuclein aggregates which are the hallmark for PD and α-synucleinopathies. AAV delivery of GBA1 is a powerful approach to restore glucocerebrosidase function and to resolve misfolded α-synuclein protein, with applications for GD and PD.",Okai T; Hioki T; Tanaka M,Neuroscience Drug Discovery Unit,

This systematic review covers the literature between 2013 and 16 November 2024 in the Scopus, Web of Science, IEEE Xplore, and Wiley databases, focusing on carbon-based sensor materials, structural design, and fabrication technologies that contribute to maximizing the sensor performance and scalability with particular emphasis on food and pharmaceutical product packaging applications. After being subjected to the inclusion and exclusion criteria, 164 studies were included in this review. The results show that most humidity sensors are made using graphene oxide (GO), though there is some progress toward cellulose and cellulose-based materials. Graphene and carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are predominant in temperature and mechanical sensors. The application of composites with structural design (e.g., porous and 3D structures) significantly improves sensitivity, long-term stability, and multifunctionality, whereas manufacturing methods such as spray coating and 3D printing further drive production scalability. The transition from metal to carbon-based electrodes could also reduce the cost. However, the scalability, long-term stability, and real-world validation remain challenges to be addressed. Future research should further enhance the performance and scalability of carbon-based sensors through low-energy fabrication techniques and the development of sustainable advanced materials to provide solutions for practical applications in dynamic transportation environments.",Stoeva Z,DZP Technologies Limited,

40332747,Amylin: From Mode of Action to Future Clinical Potential in Diabetes and Obesity.,,"Diabetes therapy : research, treatment and education of diabetes and related disorders",10.1007/s13300-025-01733-8,"Precision diabetology is increasingly becoming diabetes phenotype-driven, whereby the specific hormonal imbalances involved are taken into consideration. Concomitantly, body weight-favorable therapeutic approaches are being dictated by the obesity pandemic, which extends to all diabetes subpopulations. Amylin, an anorexic neuroendocrine hormone co-secreted with insulin, is deficient in individuals with diabetes and plays an important role in postprandial glucose homeostasis, with additional potential cardiovascular and neuroprotective functions. Its actions include suppressing glucagon secretion, delaying gastric emptying, increasing energy expenditure and promoting satiety. While amylin holds promise as a therapeutic agent, its translation into clinical practice is hampered by complex receptor biology, the limitations of animal models, its amyloidogenic properties and pharmacokinetic challenges. In individuals with advanced β-cell dysfunction, supplementing insulin therapy with pramlintide, the first and currently only approved injectable short-acting selective analog of amylin, has demonstrated efficacy in enhancing both postprandial and overall glycemic control in both type 2 diabetes (T2D) and type 1 diabetes (T1D) without increasing the risk of hypoglycemia or weight gain. Current research focuses on several key strategies, from enhancing amylin stability by attaching polyethylene glycol or carbohydrate molecules to amylin, to developing oral amylin formulations to improve patients' convenience, as well as developing various combination therapies to enhance weight loss and glucose regulation by targeting multiple receptors in metabolic pathways. The novel synergistically acting glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist combined with the amylin agonist, CagriSema, shows promising results in both glucose regulation and weight management. As such, amylin agonists (combined with other members of the incretin class) could represent the elusive drug candidate to address the multi-hormonal dysregulations of diabetes subtypes and qualify as a precision medicine approach that surpasses the long overdue division into T1DM and T2DM. Further development of amylin-based therapies or delivery systems is crucial to fully unlock the therapeutic potential of this intriguing hormone.Graphical abstract available for this article. Diabetes is a chronic disease with many faces, and persons affected by diabetes are continuously confronted with challenges, with injecting insulin and fighting obesity being the most recent. Current research is focused on designing drug candidates that would simultaneously address different mechanisms of high glucose in an individual and contribute to satiation, body weight control and patient convenience. Amylin is a hormone that is, similar to insulin, secreted by the pancreas. Its clinical use is currently limited to a single product, known as pramlintide, which is approved as an adjunct therapy in persons with insulin-treated diabetes. While the use of amylin is efficient, patients have to inject it with each meal and in a separate injection from insulin. Consequently, improving amylin-based medicines focuses on enabling longer action, resulting in weekly use, possibly even oral use and, most importantly, combining the functions of more than one hormone known for being involved in glucose control and the promotion of satiety. Similarly to other medicines primarily used in persons with diabetes, amylin-based medicines might eventually be used to address different diseases of the metabolic spectrum, namely obesity and its complications.",Muzurović E,Endocrinology Section,dremir@t-com.me.

40332665,Societal Versus Healthcare Perspectives on the Cost Effectiveness of Ocrelizumab for Treatment of Primary Progressive Multiple Sclerosis in Aotearoa New Zealand.,,PharmacoEconomics,10.1007/s40273-025-01486-z,"Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a progressive, degenerative, autoimmune neuronal disease. This study compares the impact of a societal versus a healthcare perspective on the cost effectiveness of treatment of primary progressive MS (PPMS) with ocrelizumab (OCR) versus best supportive care (BSC) in New Zealand. The analysis utilises a lifetime cohort Markov model based on ten Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) states, plus death. It has two structurally identical arms, with forward transition probabilities in the treatment arm obtained by multiplying forward transition probabilities (converted to rates, and back to probabilities) in the control arm by the 12-week disability progression hazard ratio in the clinical trial ORATORIO. Direct and indirect costs of MS were estimated from a 2017 Australian survey and converted to 2024 NZ dollars using purchasing power parity and the NZ consumer price index. Future costs and benefits were discounted at 3.5% per annum. The model is calibrated to NZ mortality for PPMS, and therapy ends when wheelchair dependence (EDSS7) is reached. For a modelled cohort 40 years of age starting at the ORATORIO distribution of EDSS, at 50% of the list price (viz. 50% rebate on $NZ37,384 per patient per annum), the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of OCR versus BSC is $NZ114,427 per QALY ($US64,651) from a societal perspective or $NZ146,711 ($US82,892) from a healthcare perspective. From a societal perspective, at Treasury's willingness to pay (WTP) criterion of $NZ120,200, an acquisition cost up to 56% of list price ($NZ20,935; 44% rebate) is justifiable. From a healthcare payer perspective, at Treasury's implied WTP of $NZ43,313, an acquisition cost up to 10% of list price ($NZ3738; 90% rebate) is justifiable. Based on this metric, a 5.6-fold higher investment in OCR can be justified from a societal perspective compared with a healthcare perspective. Alternatively, an acquisition cost up to 37.9% of list price (viz. 62.1% rebate or $NZ14,169) could be justified if the criterion of one GDP per capita ($NZ83,011) is used as a societal funding threshold. These results are sensitive to the cost of BSC from a societal perspective but not from a healthcare perspective. From both perspectives the cost effectiveness is sensitive to the acquisition cost and efficacy of OCR, potential waning of efficacy, the age and EDSS state when therapy begins, the cost and timing of entry of a biosimilar pharmaceutical and the discount rate. Treatment of PPMS with OCR is more cost effective from a societal than a healthcare perspective, therefore prioritisation of public funding of novel pharmaceuticals for MS and other resource intensive chronic health conditions will depend critically upon the study perspective.",Milne RJ; Schousboe C,Roche Singapore Pte Ltd; Health Outcomes Associates Ltd,richard.milne@hoa.co.nz.

While pharmacological mechanisms suggest that ACEIs may provide better cardiovascular protection than ARBs, this potential benefit has not been fully established in previous observational studies of patients with diabetes. An active-comparator new-user design within target trial emulation framework was implemented using Yinzhou Regional Health Care Database (YRHCD). We compared risks of major cardiovascular events (MACE) between older patients (age ≥ 65 years) with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) newly exposed to ACEIs and ARBs from January 1, 2010 to May 31, 2023. The primary outcomes were 3-point MACE, including hospitalized myocardial infarction, hospitalized stroke, and all-cause mortality (a proxy for cardiovascular mortality). We also assessed 4-point MACE, which further included hospitalized heart failure. Propensity scores were calculated to balance 44 identified confounders. Marginal structure models were applied to estimate per-protocol hazard ratios. A total of 18,558 individuals were included, with 1,641 initiating ACEIs and 16,917 initiating ARBs. Their median age was 72 years and 45% were male. The adjusted hazard ratio for ACEIs vs. ARBs was 0.86 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.68-1.10) for 3-point MACE and 0.83 (95% CI 0.69-0.99) for 4-point MACE. The 1-year absolute risk differences were - 0.30% (95% CI - 1.80-1.21%) for 3-point MACE and - 1.16% (95% CI - 2.97-0.66%) for 4-point MACE. Results were consistent across subgroup analyses (stratified by age, sex, as well as baseline major atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, heart failure, other antihypertensive therapy, insulin therapy, and calendar year) and sensitivity analyses. Among older patients with T2DM, the initiation of ACEIs was associated with a trend toward lower risk of MACE compared to ARBs, implying the potential cardiovascular benefits of ACEIs in this population.",,,xuyang_pucri@bjmu.edu.cn.

It includes recall periods of 24 h for symptoms and 7 days for impacts. The PAH-SYMPACT for use in Clinical Practice (SYMPACT-CP) is an adaptation of the PAH-SYMPACT in which the recall period for symptoms has been revised to 7 days, a timeframe more appropriate for clinical practice settings. The PAH-SYMPACT was psychometrically validated previously. As such, this study focused on assessing whether patients with PAH can use the SYMPACT-CP appropriately to rate their symptoms over the 7-day range, and it explored their perspectives on the utility and feasibility of completing the questionnaire as part of routine clinical assessments. This was a cross-sectional, noninterventional, qualitative study involving one-on-one telephone interviews with English-speaking adults (≥ 18 years) living in the US diagnosed with PAH. Participants were provided copies of the SYMPACT-CP to review, and interviews were subsequently conducted using a semi-structured guide including concept elicitation and cognitive interviewing sections. Transcripts were coded using a coding framework based on the interview guide. Fifteen participants were interviewed (mean age, 49.9 years; n = 13 female, n = 13 White). Most (n = 12) stated that they thought about the last 7 calendar days or the ""last week"" when asked to interpret the 7-day recall period and all but one (n = 14) could easily remember their symptoms over this period.

Domains nominated by TRM-SLE Taskforce members were rated in a two-stage modified Delphi study. Each stage comprised two online survey rounds separated by a structured discussion meeting. In Stage 1, expert lupus clinicians and patient representatives rated domain 'importance' (impact on symptoms, function or survival). In Stage 2, clinicians rated 'important' domains on three characteristics relevant to RCT utility: 'appropriateness' for evaluating change in disease activity, 'representation' in patients with active SLE and 'measurability' in an RCT context. Consensus for domain inclusion was prespecified as all four characteristics achieving a rating ≥7 on a 1-9 scale by ≥70% of participants. Domain nominations from 36/59 (61%) TRM-SLE Taskforce members yielded 34 potential domains which were rated in the modified Delphi study. At least one Delphi round was completed by 87 clinicians and 13 patient representatives. In Stage 1, 14 domains met consensus on 'importance' in both clinician and patient groups, and 11 domains met consensus among patients only. After Stage 2, eight of these domains also reached consensus on 'appropriateness', 'representation' and 'measurability': alopecia, arthritis, haemolytic anaemia, nephritis, mucosal ulcers, rash, serositis and thrombocytopenia.

However, the steep cost of targeted therapy poses significant financial burden for individuals and health systems. We aimed to determine the trends in Medicare and Medicaid spending on CFTR modulators between the years 2015 and 2022 through retrospective analysis of the Medicare and Medicaid claims data. The outcome measures included total dosage units prescribed, number of claims, spending per claim, and total spending on CFTR modulators for Medicare and Medicaid between 2015 to 2022. Average annual percentage changes (AAPC) were calculated for all outcome measures. Our results show that from 2015 to 2022, Medicaid consistently had higher total dosage units prescribed, number of claims, spending per claim, and overall spending on CFTR modulators compared to Medicare. Total spending for both Medicaid [AAPC 38.9, 95 % confidence interval [CI] 27.2-51.6, p < 0.01] and Medicare [AAPC 39.2, 95 % CI 30.2-55.1, p < 0.01] increased significantly during this period. Increases in CFTR spending was accelerated beginning in 2019, when the triple combination CFTR modulator therapy, elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor, was introduced to the US market. This increase has been accompanied by a reduction in spending and use of other CFTR agents. This study evaluated the increases in spending for CFTR modulators over the years and the main drivers behind them, which may help inform future negotiations between healthcare systems and pharmaceutical companies, as well as policy makers and stakeholders.",,,secongly@ucalgary.ca.

The introduction of EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) has fundamentally changed the treatment landscape for such patients by improving both progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). Among EGFR-TKIs, third-generation agents such as osimertinib have shown marked efficacy and favorable safety profiles and have become the standard of care in the first-line setting. The combination of osimertinib with platinum-based chemotherapy has recently been shown to improve PFS compared with osimertinib monotherapy in the FLAURA2 trial. Similarly, the MARIPOSA trial demonstrated clinical benefit of the combination of the EGFR-MET bispecific antibody, amivantamab, with the third-generation EGFR-TKI, lazertinib, further supporting the use of combination therapies as first-line treatment for EGFR-mutated NSCLC. Despite these advances, however, challenges such as brain metastases remain substantial barriers to successful treatment outcomes. Management of patients with such metastases often requires a multidisciplinary approach that integrates systemic treatment with local interventions such as radiation therapy. Finally, circulating tumor DNA has emerged as a promising biomarker for real-time monitoring of treatment response and evolution of drug resistance mechanisms. Analysis of such biomarkers can facilitate dynamic and personalized therapeutic adjustments, potentially improving outcomes. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the latest clinical evidence supporting therapeutic advances in the management of EGFR-mutated NSCLC, emphasizing the importance of tailoring treatment strategies based on tumor biology, patient-specific factors, and evolving therapeutic options.",,,hidet31@med.kindai.ac.jp.

This may perpetuate barriers to care and reduce treatment generalizability, especially in populations with elevated rates of STB, such as body dysmorphic disorder (BDD). We conducted a cohort study of randomized controlled trial (RCT) participants (N=80) who received a smartphone-based cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) treatment for BDD that allowed for most forms of past STB, except for past-month active suicidal ideation. This study had two objectives: (1) to characterize the sample's lifetime prevalence of STB and (2) to estimate and predict STB incidence during the trial. We completed secondary analyses on data from an RCT of smartphone-delivered CBT for BDD. The primary outcomes consisted of STB severity and suicide attempt assessed at baseline with the Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS) and weekly during the trial via one item from the Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology-Self Report (QIDS-SR item #12; 1043 observations). We computed descriptive statistics (n, %) and ran a series of bi- and multivariate linear regressions predicting STB incidence during the 3-month trial. At baseline, 40% of participants reported a lifetime history of active suicidal thoughts and 10% reported lifetime suicide attempts. During the 3-month trial, 42.5% reporting thinking about death or suicide via weekly assessment. No participants reported frequent or acute suicidal thoughts, plans, or attempts. Lifetime suicide attempt (odds ratio 11, 95% CI 2.14-59.14; P<.01) and lifetime severity of suicidal thoughts (odds ratio 1.76, 95% CI 1.21-2.77; P<.01) were significant bivariate predictors of death- or suicide-related thought incidence reported during the trial. Multivariate models including STB risk factor covariates (eg, age, and sexual orientation) modestly improved prediction of death- or suicide-related thoughts (eg, positive predictive value=0.91, negative predictive value=0.75, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve=0.83). Although some participants may think about death and suicide during a DMHI trial, it may be safe and feasible to include participants with most forms of past STB. Among other procedures, researchers should carefully select eligibility criteria, use frequent, ongoing, low-burden, and valid monitoring procedures, and implement risk mitigation protocols tailored to the presenting problem.",,,

A range of clinical chemical parameters were measured in 7-day toxicology studies for 86 toxins eliciting a range of organ- and mechanism-specific effects. Additionally, 21 surgical or physiological stressors were evaluated to identify physiological or metabolic responses that might confound the interpretation of observed toxicity profiles. From these studies on a total of 3473 rats measured at six pharmaceutical companies, we provide a set of 12 serum and 5 urine physical and clinical chemistry parameters. Samples were collected at 24 h, 48 h and 168 h post-dose for each animal and are presented as a downloadable database file. We also summarise the main observations based on the group response at the level of the individual toxin. We demonstrate that correlations between parameters, such as serum bilirubin and aspartate aminotransferase (AST), provide a more nuanced profile of organ-specific toxicity than consideration of individual parameters alone. In addition, we highlight the variability in the measured parameters across the dataset attributable to inter-laboratory differences, and the heterogeneity of metabolic responses to particular compounds or differences in temporal patterns of response. This clinical chemistry atlas of toxicity serves as a valuable reference tool for evaluating the potential toxicity of novel drug candidates.",Reily MD; Robertson D; Lehman-McKeeman L; Car BD; Cantor GH,Formerly Pfizer Global R&D; Formerly Bristol-Myers-Squibb Company,Jeremy.Nicholson@murdoch.edu.au.

Studies have shown that PCOS is associated with poor quality of life, anxiety, sadness, dissatisfaction with one's appearance, and sexual dysfunction. This study was conducted to determine whether a strong psycho-pathological personality is related to PCOS and whether this personality is related to the hyperandrogenic state. Anthropometric, metabolic, hormonal, clinical, and psychological characteristics were examined in 90 Bahraini women with PCOS. After confirming the diagnosis of PCOS via Rotterdam criteria, including ovarian ultrasound, each patient was evaluated via the following questionnaires: 1) the GAD-7 (General Anxiety Disorder-7) to measure the severity of anxiety; 2) the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) to confirm and measure the severity of depression; 3) the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale (BIS-11) to measure aggression; and 4) the McLean Screening Instrument to identify borderline personality disorders (MSI-BPDs). The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board. Compared to controls, PCOS patients exhibited significantly higher rates of severe depression (8% vs. 0%, p < 0.001), severe anxiety (7% vs. 0%, p < 0.001), impulsivity (BIS-11: 39.43 ± 9.69 vs. 26.64 ± 2.92, p < 0.001), and borderline personality traits (McLean: 2.41 ± 2.44 vs. 1.2 ± 0.94, p < 0.001). Metabolic comorbidities, including obesity (BMI 28.88 vs. 20.27, p < 0.001) and hypothyroidism (48% vs. 0%, p < 0.001), were prevalent in PCOS. Hyperandrogenism correlated weakly with psychiatric outcomes (all p > 0.05). Women with PCOS demonstrate markedly elevated psychiatric and medical burdens compared to healthy controls. While hyperandrogenism showed limited direct associations, metabolic dysfunction (e.g., obesity) may mediate psychiatric risk. These findings underscore the need for multidisciplinary care integrating psychological and endocrine management, particularly in populations where cultural norms exacerbate PCOS-related distress.",,,mariwan.husni@nosm.ca.
40325417,Public health impact and cost-effectiveness of introducing MenACWY vaccination strategies in Germany.,2025-05-06,BMC public health,10.1186/s12889-025-21491-3,"The invasive meningococcal disease (IMD) routine immunization recommendation in Germany is a meningococcal serogroup C (MenC) conjugate vaccine for toddlers aged 12 months with a catch-up for unimmunized up to 17 years. However, there are no recommendations for routine meningococcal serogroups A, C, W, Y (MenACWY) vaccination or for adolescent vaccinations; this differs from other European countries. This analysis aimed to understand the benefits of implementing adolescent MenACWY vaccination in Germany. A static population-cohort model evaluating IMD burden and related health outcomes (e.g., cases, cases with long-term sequelae, deaths) was developed to compare any two meningococcal vaccination strategies. We compared hypothetical vaccination strategies that included different approaches to adolescent vaccination in Germany, such as vaccinating at 13-year olds versus 16-year olds and vaccinating with MenC versus MenACWY. Additional strategies considered the benefit that could be provided by switching the current MenC vaccine recommendation in toddlers to MenACWY. All strategies that included MenACWY vaccine were effective in decreasing the number of cases, preventing mortality and offered good value for money. The greatest benefit was observed in individuals vaccinated with MenACWY at 12 months and 16 years of age (2,978 IMD cases averted; 563 IMD deaths prevented). Compared with the current strategy of MenC vaccination at 12 months of age, two-dose strategies that included MenACWY reported incremental cost-effectiveness ratios <€13,205 per quality-adjusted life year. Adolescent strategies of MenC or MenACWY vaccine at 16 years old (with no vaccination at 12 months) dominated current vaccination strategies. Adolescent vaccination at 16 years old versus 13 years old offered slightly better value for money. With recent increases in IMD cases and outbreaks occurring globally following the COVID-19 pandemic, there is a greater urgency to proactively implement a MenACWY vaccine recommendation to protect adolescents in Germany. This recommendation would provide direct protection to a group at increased risk and offer indirect protection to other population groups. Implementation of a school-based immunization program could increase vaccine uptake and overcome hurdles in adolescent vaccination.",Schley K; Janßen S; Sullivan SM; Tichy E; Findlow J,Pfizer Limited; Evidera/PPD; Pfizer Pharma GmbH,Katharina.Schley@Pfizer.com.

Variable temperature ion mobility-mass spectrometry (VT-IM-MS) can measure the effect of temperature on conformational landscapes. To delineate collision effects from structural change we report measurements using molecules with different degrees of rigidity namely: poly (L-lysine) (PLL) dendrimer, ubiquitin, β-casein and α-synuclein from 190-350 K. The CCS of PLL dendrimer varies with temperature consistent with collision theory, by contrast, the structure of each protein alters with notable restructuring at 350 K and 250 K, following predicted in vitro stability curves. At 210 K and 190 K we kinetically trap unfolding intermediates. For alpha-synuclein, the 13+ ions present two distinct conformers and VT-IM-MS measurements allow us to calculate the transition rate and activation energies of their conversion.

Over the past decade, first-, second-, and third-generation EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have substantially improved clinical outcomes, although acquired resistance inevitably emerges. In particular, the third-generation TKI osimertinib has demonstrated superior progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) compared to earlier-generation TKIs in the frontline setting, yet median OS remains approximately three years in pivotal trials. Efforts to extend disease control have led to various upfront intensification strategies, including combining EGFR TKIs with antiangiogenics or chemotherapy (e.g., the FLAURA-2 trial), and pairing novel bispecific antibodies such as amivantamab with third-generation TKIs. Upon progression on third-generation EGFR TKIs, platinum-based chemotherapy remains the standard second-line treatment, albeit with modest response rates. Emerging therapies targeting MET amplification (e.g., savolitinib plus osimertinib), leveraging antibody-drug conjugates (e.g., patritumab deruxtecan), or adding immunotherapy and antiangiogenics have shown preliminary promise in overcoming resistance. Ongoing trials are assessing optimal treatment sequencing and the use of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) to guide therapy escalation or de-escalation.

Data sources included semistructured interviews of individuals affiliated with the commercial health data industry from May 2022 to May 2023 and publicly available documents. Data were analyzed from May 2022 to May 2024. Individual semistructured interviews and relevant publicly available documents were analyzed to gain an understanding of data collection and commercialization practices in the primary care record industry. The analysis involved a continuous and iterative process of data collection and analysis, theoretical sampling, data-driven coding, and creation of theoretical concepts.

Since COPD patients are often faced with difficult decisions, an assessment was made of their desire for disease education. Our aim was to identify patients understanding of their disease and what their attitudes are towards different treatment options and whether this correlates to demographic factors. The COPD-Assessment-Test (CAT) was used to measure subjective disease burden. The COPD-Questionnaire (COPD-Q) was used to assess subjects' own knowledge of their disease. In addition, a specifically designed questionnaire was used to assess patient's subjective level of desire to be educated on COPD-specific topics. A multiple linear regression analysis was performed to identify the demographic factors associated with a greater desire for disease-specific information. 127 patients (67.2±8.8 years) were prospectively enrolled. Mean CAT score was 21.3±8.9 (95% CI:1-40). The desire for medical consultation was highly individual. In terms of vaccination, 31.5% of patients wished for more information while 34.6% wished for less. This also held true for information on long-term pharmacological therapy (29.1% vs 30.7%, respectively). Information on behaviour in case of emergencies as well as smoking cessation were wished for 38% and 42% of patients, respectively. Results of the COPD-Q showed that subjects were well-informed about specific topics (vaccination, etiology, emergency-inhaler) and less informed about long-term pharmacotherapy. In linear regression analyses, age (p=0.086), sex (p=0.906), education (p=0.833), health literacy (p=0.336) and burden of disease (p=0.296) did not influence patients´ desire for disease-specific information. Based on our cohort, COPD patients wish for more medical information related to behaviour in emergency situations and smoking cessation. The desire for education on disease-specific topics did not naturally correlate with demographic characteristics. The provision of medical information to patients remains a highly individualized and essential part of patient care.

Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is emerging as a novel non-invasive treatment for bipolar depression. We developed a home-based protocol for tDCS which has demonstrated efficacy in unipolar and bipolar depression. We sought to explore the acceptability of home-based tDCS in bipolar depression. Participants were 35 (26 women) with bipolar disorder (mean age 47.37 years, SD ± 13.78) in a current depressive episode of at least moderate severity. tDCS was provided in a bifrontal montage 2 mA for 30 minutes in sessions over 6 weeks with real-time supervision. Acceptability was assessed in a questionnaire and individual interviews, conducted at two timepoints: baseline and post treatment. Individual interviews were analysed by thematic analysis. Six main themes were found: helpfulness, side effects, burden, gratitude, ethicality and comparison to medications. The themes of gratitude and comparison with medications were novel in this group compared to unipolar depression. Themes reflected high acceptability of tDCS treatment in bipolar depression and indicated strong interest in novel treatments in this population. Qualitative analysis can provide novel insights into individual experiences, understanding barriers to treatment, and offer guidance for improving clinical treatments.

Single-arm, exploratory phase IIIb trial conducted at 12 sites in the United States. Eligible adults with rCDI received one administration of RBL consisting of one 150-mL dose of RBL, delivered via colonoscopy to the right side of the colon. The primary endpoint assessed RBL-related treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) within 8 weeks of RBL administration or until confirmed treatment failure. Secondary endpoints included treatment success (absence of CDI recurrence for 8 weeks following RBL administration), physician experience administering RBL via colonoscopy, and physician perception of participant benefit. Of 54 participants screened, 41 were enrolled and received RBL via colonoscopy; 39 participants completed the 8-week visit. Five TEAEs in four participants (9.8%) were assessed as related to RBL, all of which were gastrointestinal and mild in severity. Overall, 18 participants (43.9%) experienced 33 TEAEs within 8 weeks, most of which were of mild (25/33; 75.8%) or moderate (5/33; 15.2%) severity. No TEAEs led to intensive care unit admission or death. Overall, 39 participants (95.1%) experienced treatment success; 2 participants (4.9%) withdrew consent and had an indeterminate outcome.

This study evaluated a novel ingestible medical device (MD) for SI luminal sample collection. A monocentric interventional trial (NCT05477069) was conducted on 15 healthy subjects. Metagenomics, metabolomics and culturomics assessed the MD's effectiveness in characterizing the healthy SI microbiome and identifying potential biomarkers. The SI microbiota differed significantly from the fecal microbiota, displaying high inter-individual variability, lower species richness, and reduced alpha diversity. A combined untargeted and semi-targeted LC-MS/MS metabolomics approach identified a distinct SI metabolic footprint, with bile acids and amino acids being the most abundant classes of metabolites. Host and host/microbe-derived bile acids were particularly abundant in SI samples. The application of a fast culturomics approach to two SI samples enabled species-level characterization, resulting in the identification of 90 bacterial species, including five potential novel species.

One way to accelerate the development of pro-cognitive therapies for schizophrenia is to evaluate compounds using biomarker approaches tailored to relevant neural mechanisms. While D1/D5 receptor (D1R/D5R) agonism has been extensively studied in neuroscience, its therapeutic potential for cognitive impairment in schizophrenia remains untapped. The Translational Neuroscience & Computational Evaluation of a D1R Partial Agonist for Schizophrenia (TRANSCENDS) clinical trial tests this mechanism using a 'target engagement' approach. Multiple, double-blind doses of a D1/D5R partial agonist were administered in advance of a functional neuroimaging (fMRI) session that deployed a cognitive paradigm explicitly designed to capture a translational micro-circuit mechanism underlying spatial working memory in patients with schizophrenia. Specifically, this study will assess whether the D1R/D5R partial agonist CVL-562 induces a dose-dependent engagement of spatial working memory circuits in schizophrenia using fMRI. This design, and the use of spatial working memory neural circuits as a dependent measure, was selected on the basis of a translational and computational understanding of prefrontal micro-circuitry and a mechanistic understanding of the role of D1R/D5Rs in schizophrenia. To enhance data integration and scalability, TRANSCENDS employs an automated informatics framework for seamless neuroimaging data sharing and electronic clinical data capture. This ensures high-standards for regulatory compliance, data quality, and data sharing across sites, improving aspects of current clinical trial data management.

Retrospective cohorts of working women from the beginning to the end of pregnancy in three public hospitals and one pharmaceutical company, between 2015 and 2019. We measured the frequency and duration of absences, by age and occupational variables, and cumulative absence days, classifying work status as at work, on SL and on POR absence. Differences between groups for each variable were analysed through the Kruskal-Wallis rank test followed by Dunn's Pairwise Comparisons. Sequence analysis was used to identify pregnancy trajectories. Among 1116 pregnant workers, absence days due to SL ranged from 9.9% to 28.6% of total possible working days, from 9.2% to 38.4% due to POR, while only 3.9% did not take any absence. Nurse aides and nurses used benefits most often and for the longest duration with respect to other occupational categories (p value<0.001). Age had no statistically significant difference (p value=0.245). Three pregnancy trajectories were identified, characterised by mostly active work, active work combined with POR and active work with SL, with differences by workplace, occupation and work area (p value<0.001). The total time in days during which pregnant women were actively working ranged between 56% and 64% depending on the organisation. This study in four organisations shows a very similar pattern regarding total time absent from work during pregnancy. Women were actively working for two-thirds of their pregnancy. Of the remaining time, while in two organisations, absences were mainly due to SL, in other two were due to POR. Organisational variations in the management of pregnant women could be an explanation.

40321182,TRAP: a contrastive learning-enhanced framework for robust TCR-pMHC binding prediction with improved generalizability.,,Chemical science,10.1039/d4sc08141b,"The binding of T cell receptors (TCRs) to peptide-MHC I (pMHC) complexes is critical for triggering adaptive immune responses to potential health threats. Developing highly accurate machine learning (ML) models to predict TCR-pMHC binding could significantly accelerate immunotherapy advancements. However, existing ML models for TCR-pMHC binding prediction often underperform with unseen epitopes, severely limiting their applicability. We introduce TRAP, which leverages contrastive learning to enhance model performance by aligning structural and sequence features of pMHC with TCR sequences. TRAP outperforms previous state-of-the-art models in both random and unseen epitope scenarios, achieving an AUPR of 0.84 (a 22% improvement over the second-best model) and an AUC of 0.92 in the random scenario, and an AUC of 0.75 (almost 11% higher than the second-best model) in the unseen epitope scenario. Furthermore, TRAP demonstrates a noteworthy capability to diagnose potential issues of cross-reactivity between TCRs and similar epitopes. This highly robust performance makes it a suitable tool for large-scale predictions in real-world settings. A specific case study confirmed that TRAP can discover hit TCRs with binding free energies comparable to referenced experimental results. These findings highlight TRAP's potential for practical applications and its role as a powerful tool in developing TCR-based immunotherapies.",Deng Y,CarbonSilicon AI Technology Company,kimhsieh@zju.edu.cn

This study aims to address the contribution of 17q gain to neuroblastoma malignancy. We analyzed the genetic and transcriptional landscape of 417 neuroblastoma patients across various risk groups and clinical stages using multi-omic approaches. Single-cell RNA/DNA sequencing and SNP arrays were combined to characterize genomic aberrations, while evolutionary trajectories were mapped to explore the accumulation of genetic changes in patients with neuroblastoma. Additionally, DNA and RNA sequencing were used to assess mutational burden and gene expression patterns. Our findings suggest that chromosome 17 gain is an early genetic event acquired during neuroblastoma development, correlating with the accumulation of additional chromosomal aberrations and poor prognosis. Increased segmental gains of chromosome 17q were observed during clonal evolution, relapse disease and metastasis. We identified PPM1D, a p53-inducible Ser/Thr phosphatase located on chr17q22.3, as a key player activated by segmental 17q-gain, gene-fusion, or gain-of-function somatic and germline mutations, further promoting neuroblastoma development/progression.

This study aimed to examine the therapeutic effects of FLWXF on ""Qi-Yin deficiency"" arrhythmia and elucidate the underlying mechanisms involved. The therapeutic effects of FLWXF were assessed using isoproterenol (ISO)-induced arrhythmia models and models indicative of ""Qi-Yin deficiency."" To elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying the effects of FLWXF in ""Qi-Yin deficiency"" arrhythmia, proteomics and metabolomics techniques were used for predictive analysis, which was subsequently validated through reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) and Western blotting. Our findings demonstrated that FLWXF could ameliorate electrical signal abnormalities, atypical serum indicators, and myocardial damage induced by ISO. Moreover, FLWXF effectively mitigated electrical signal irregularities and abnormal serum markers associated with ""Qi-Yin deficiency"" and exhibited therapeutic efficacy in treating ""Qi-Yin deficiency"" arrhythmia. We identified significant enrichment of dilated cardiomyopathy and adrenergic signaling pathways in cardiomyocytes through integrated proteomics and metabolomics analyses. Additionally, our study revealed that FLWXF can normalize the aberrant elevation of cyclic adenosine monophosphate levels. RT-qPCR and Western blotting assays validated that FLWXF restored the expression of genes and proteins associated with dilated cardiomyopathy and the adrenergic signaling pathway in cardiomyocytes, including ADRB1, GNAS, ADCY1, PKA, CACNA2D1, RYR2, TNNC1, TNNI3, TNNT2, TPM1, ACTC1, and MYL7.

In the current study, we examined whether the positivity offset is relevant to explaining anhedonia and liability for psychosis among individuals at clinical high-risk for psychosis (CHR) (i.e., individuals exhibiting attenuated hallucinations or delusions that cause distress and functional decline). Mathematical modeling approaches from Cacioppo's Evaluative Space Model were applied to six days of digital phenotyping data collected in daily life among 100 individuals at CHR and 57 healthy controls (CN). Participants reported levels of positive emotion, negative emotion, and arousal throughout the day via ecological momentary assessment (EMA) surveys while accelerometry was passively recorded. EMA surveys were used to calculate the positivity offset and examine associations with real-world motivated behavior. Results indicated that the positivity offset was present among individuals at CHR, but diminished compared to CN. Importantly, smaller positivity offset scores were associated with greater clinically rated anhedonia, particularly among CHR cases with comorbid mood disorder diagnoses. Findings suggest that reductions in the positivity offset are a mechanism underlying anhedonia across phases of psychotic illness and represent a novel treatment target that is relevant for the treatment of negative symptoms and prevention of psychotic disorders.",,,gstrauss@uga.edu.

All patients were classified into non-SLD, MASLD, or MetALD groups. The effect of MASLD on gallstone development was evaluated using multivariate Cox regression analysis. Age, male sex, and MASLD were identified as independent risk factors for gallstone development. MASLD was associated with a significantly higher risk of developing gallstones than non-SLD (hazard ratio [HR] 1.7112; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.4294-2.0486; p < 0.0001) and MetALD (HR 1.3516, 95% CI 1.0130-1.8033, p = 0.0406). However, the risk of MetALD did not significantly differ between the SLD and non-SLD groups. Hypertension was the only significant independent cardiometabolic risk factor for gallstone development in the MASLD group (HR 1.4350, 95% CI 1.0545-1.9528; p = 0.0216). Random forest analysis and directed acyclic graphs identified hypertension as the most important direct factor affecting gallstone development in patients with MASLD. MASLD was an independent risk factor for gallstone development, whereas MetALD presented a similar risk as non-SLD. Moderate alcohol consumption may reduce the risk of gallstone formation in patients with MASLD. Hypertension may be the most significant cardiometabolic risk factor for gallstone development in patients with MASLD.",Yoshinaga S,Medical Examination Section,
40317387,Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of Nirsevimab for the Prevention of Respiratory Syncytial Virus among Italian Infants.,,Clinical drug investigation,10.1007/s40261-025-01437-8,"Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a major global cause of childhood respiratory infections, globally linked to significant morbidity and mortality, particularly leading in hospitalizations and death among infants below 1 year of age. A cost-effectiveness analysis was conducted to estimate the economically justifiable price (EJP) of nirsevimab, a new prophylaxis strategy protecting all infants against RSV lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs), compared with a strategy consisting of palivizumab, protecting only high-risk infants and no preventive intervention for others. A static decision tree model previously published to evaluate the clinical and economic burden of RSV in Italy was used to determine the EJP of nirsevimab for the prevention of RSV medically attended lower respiratory tract infections (RSV-MA-LRTIs) in all infants experiencing their first RSV season, to become a cost-effective alternative compared with palivizumab only in high-risk infants and no preventive intervention for others. The EJP was estimated considering three different willingness-to-pay (WTP) thresholds. The National Health Service (NHS) perspective was considered in the base-case. Direct costs considered in the analysis were acquisition and administration costs of prophylaxis, costs of managing RSV infection (inpatient and outpatient care, and emergency department visits) and costs of handling complications following hospitalization per RSV event. Indirect costs were evaluated in the scenario analysis as productivity loss due to premature death for RSV infection. A discount rate of 3.0% was applied only to mid-long-term costs and outcomes. From the NHS perspective, over the first RSV season, nirsevimab in an all-infants population could be a cost-effective approach compared with palivizumab only in high-risk infants, with an EJP equal to €267, €365, and €400 considering a WTP threshold of €0, €22,000, and €30,000 per QALY saved, respectively. Considering only the palivizumab-eligible population, the model estimated that nirsevimab could be a cost-effective approach with an EJP equal to €3,467, €3,633, and €3,694 considering a WTP threshold of €0, €22,000, and €30,000 per QALY saved, respectively. A prophylaxis strategy against RSV infection targeting all infants with nirsevimab could represent a cost-effective option for both NHS and societal perspectives, and supports the implementation and the equity of RSV prevention for all infants.",Muzii B; Soudani S,Sanofi,chiara.bini@uniroma2.it.
40317371,Perinatal risk factors and disordered eating in children and adolescents.,2025-05-03,Eating and weight disorders : EWD,10.1007/s40519-025-01751-2,"Studies have reported associations between perinatal factors (obstetric and neonatal factors) and later eating disorder risk. However, previous findings have been partly conflicting. Here, we analyzed associations between perinatal factors and disordered eating in a large cohort of Finnish children and adolescents. The participants were 8- to 14-year-old children and adolescents (N = 11,357) from The Finnish Health in Teens study. Disordered eating was assessed using the Children's Eating Attitudes Test (ChEAT). Perinatal data were obtained from the Finnish Birth Registry. Perinatal variables were initially analyzed using Chi-square analyses and linear regressions. Variables associated with disordered eating (p < .10) were entered into a multinomial logistic regression model. The regression analysis was conducted both including and excluding maternal BMI, as this information was missing for > 80% of the participants. Of the participants, 56.6% reported disordered eating (ChEAT score ≥ 11) or partial disordered eating (1-10) symptoms. Including maternal BMI in the analyses (n = 1921), higher levels of disordered eating were independently associated with maternal pre-pregnancy BMI (OR 1.07, 95% CI [1.02, 1.12]), maternal smoking during pregnancy (OR 2.64, 95% CI [1.49, 4.68]), urgent or emergency cesarean birth (OR 2.16, 95% CI [1.10, 4.05]). Assisted reproduction was associated with lower levels of disordered eating (OR 0.39, 95% CI [0.20, 0.76]). The results suggest that pregnancy and childbirth are vulnerable developmental periods, associated with later eating pathology. Further studies disentangling genetic and environmental mechanisms of associations between perinatal factors and later eating pathology are needed.

40317286,"Predicting perioperative risk of persistent paraplegia from preoperative factors in patients who undergo elective, open thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm repair.",,The Journal of thoracic and cardiovascular surgery,10.1016/j.jtcvs.2025.04.001,"Spinal cord injury is a risk for patients undergoing thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm (TAAA) repair, the most substantial deficit being persistent paraplegia (PP). Adequately estimating patients' risk of PP is vital for patient counseling and postoperative risk stratification. Patients who underwent open, elective TAAA repair (1986-2024; N = 2827) at a single practice were categorized into 4 groups: those with PP (n = 68) at discharge or death, those with persistent paraparesis (n = 55) at discharge or death, those with transient paraplegia or paraparesis (n = 132), and those without any spinal cord deficit (SCD, n = 2572); 4 cohorts were created comprising combinations of these groups. Several models were evaluated, including logistic regression and machine-learning approaches, to better understand predictors of PP and other SCDs in key cohorts. Regarding prediction of PP, the gradient boosting machine was best (C = 0.79 [0.75-0.81]); however, the multivariable logistic regression model was similar (0.78 [0.74-0.81]) and was converted into a nomogram to highlight the predictive value of diabetes (odds ratio, 2.48; P = .009), previous percutaneous coronary intervention (OR, 3.04; P < .001), chronic kidney disease (OR, 2.48; P < .001), tobacco use (OR, 13.25; P = .01), symptomatic aortic disease (OR, 1.96; P = .01), and Crawford extent of TAAA repair (II: OR, 4.00; P < .001). Predictors of PP and SCD in key cohorts were similar. For patients undergoing elective, open TAAA repair, the risk of PP can be estimated from preoperative characteristics and explained by an intuitive nomogram to aid personalized preoperative counseling, with greater-risk patients prioritized perioperatively for rigorous blood pressure monitoring, increased cerebrospinal fluid drainage, or a lower threshold for transfusion.",,,jcoselli@bcm.edu.
40317073,Cephalosporin-based combination therapies for combating ESKAPE pathogens: a patent review.,2025-05-10,Journal of applied microbiology,10.1093/jambio/lxaf107,"ESKAPE (namely Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Enterobacter) pathogens pose a major threat to global health. The World Health Organization highlights the need for new antimicrobial strategies, including combination therapies, to address their resistance. Cephalosporins, due to their broad-spectrum activity and safety profile, are widely used in hospitals and serve as strong candidates for such regimens. While many studies explore cephalosporin combinations, there is a lack of systematic reviews focused on patent literature. This study analyses patent filings related to cephalosporin-based combination therapies targeting ESKAPE pathogens. The Espacenet database was thoroughly searched using the keywords ""combination,"" ""antibiotics,"" and ""cephalosporin"" yielding 666 patent applications filed up to June 2024. Based on the inclusion criteria, 30 patents were selected for further analysis. Notably, most patents were filed in China and the USA, accounting for up to 30% and 17%, respectively. Most patents were filed by private companies and classified under the International Patent Classification code A61K, indicating their pharmaceutical applications. Additionally, in 2022, the highest number of patents were filed in this area. However, clinical data were included in only two patents, reflecting a broader challenge: the high cost of development limits real-world validation of these combinations. Despite this, the patent landscape offers valuable insights into emerging strategies for combating ESKAPE pathogens with cephalosporin-based therapies.",,,

This study investigates senescence-mediated inflammation as a novel mechanism of action for PARP inhibitors in HRP cancers. Transcriptome analyses were performed in olaparib-treated HeLa cells as a HRP model. Interferon regulatory factor-Lucia luciferase (IRF-Luc) reporter activity was assessed. The effects of PARP inhibitors on senescence-like phenotypes were assessed in seven HRP cancer cell lines, based on morphological changes, senescence-associated β-galactosidase (SA-β-GAL) activity, cellular granularity, and senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP)-related gene expression. Peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) migration assays were also performed with the conditioned medium in treatment with the PARP inhibitor. Transcriptome analyses revealed numbers of inflammatory cytokine- and chemokine-related pathways were significantly upregulated in olaparib-treated HeLa cells, which were confirmed by IRF-Luc reporter assays. The PARP inhibitors induced senescent phenotypes in HRP cancer cell lines: flattened and enlarged morphology, increased SA-β-GAL activity, elevated cellular granularity, and upregulated expressions of SASP-related genes (e.g., IL1B, IL6, and CXCL10). Furthermore, in vitro migration assays revealed that PARP inhibitor-treated HRP cancer cells attracted PBMCs more abundantly, suggesting the potential for recruiting immune cells to HRP cancer cells through senescence-mediated immunological activation. Our findings suggest that PARP inhibitors recruit immune cells to HRP cancer cells, potentially activating immune responses in the tumor microenvironment, providing new insights into the clinical benefits of PARP inhibitors in immunotherapy for patients with HRP OC.",,,rykamat@east.ncc.go.jp.

In the ARISE-HF trial, the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ), cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET), Physical Activity Scale for the Elderly (PASE) score, echocardiographic, and laboratory assessments were performed at baseline in 691 persons with DbCM. Study participants with lower KCCQ-Clinical Summary Score (CSS) were predominantly women, had poorer kidney function, higher body-mass index and natriuretic peptides, and lower hemoglobin levels. Lower KCCQ-CSS scores were associated with shorter CPET duration, lower peak exercise oxygen consumption (VO₂) and lower PASE scores, but the correlations were weak (CPET duration: r = 0.14, 95 % CI: 0.07-0.22; peak VO₂: r = 0.21, 95 % CI: 0.14-0.28; PASE score: r = 0.19, 95 % CI: 0.11-0.26), indicating that although worse health status was linked to poorer function and activity, the strength of these relationships was limited. No meaningful associations were observed between KCCQ-CSS and echocardiographic measurements, cardiac biomarkers, or kidney function.

This INTERASPIRE study determined the frequency of HTG and residual combined dyslipidemia and their related factors in patients with coronary heart disease (CHD) from 13 countries across six World Health Organization (WHO) regions. Participants with CHD underwent a standardized study interview and examination, including a centralized analysis of fasting blood samples. Elevated triglyceride (TG) and LDL-cholesterol were defined as ≥ 1.7 mmol/L and 1.8 mmol/L, respectively. Elevation in both was considered combined dyslipidemia. Lipid profiles were available for 4069 patients. The mean age was 60.1 years (21.1 % women, 12.6 % smokers, 24 % obesity by body mass index [BMI], 61 % hypertension, and 44 % self-reported diabetes). Participants were evaluated 1.05 (0.76-1.45) years after their index CHD hospitalization. Overall, 12.7 % used no lipid-lowering therapies (LLT), 50.0 % used high-dose statins, and 11.8 % used combination therapies. Specific TG-lowering therapies were used by 2.3 %. One-third of patients had HTG, and 24.6 % had combined dyslipidemia. HTG was seen in all countries, but median TG values varied, with higher values among those not using LLT. HTG was independently associated with female sex, smoking, BMI, blood pressure, and LDL-cholesterol. HTG was inversely associated with HDL-cholesterol.

This process usually involves two phases: first, collecting inexpensive variables from all samples, and second, selecting a subset for expensive measurements, for example, sequencing-based biomarkers. Common two-phase designs include nested case-control and case-cohort designs. Additional designs include sampling subjects based on follow-up time, like extreme case-control designs. Recently an optimal two-phase design using a maximum likelihood-based method was proposed, which could accommodate arbitrary sample selection in the second phase. However, direct comparisons of this optimal design with others in terms of power and computational cost is lacking. This study performs a direct evaluation of typical two-phase designs, including Tao's optimal design, on type I error, power, effect size estimation, and computational time, using both simulated and real data sets. Results show that the optimal design had the highest power and accurate effect size estimation under the Cox regression model. Surprisingly, logistic regression achieved similar power with much lower computational cost than a more sophisticated method. The study further applied these methods to the MP2PRT study, reporting hazard ratios of cancer subtypes on relapse risk. Recommendations for selecting two-phase designs and analysis methods are regarding power, bias of estimated effect size, and computational time.",Chen W,Department of Health Sciences Research,

This study aimed to quantify longitudinal changes in Unified Huntington's Disease Rating Scale (UHDRS) scores and evaluate their susceptibility to placebo response, enhancing our understanding of disease progression and ability to optimize future trials. We used data from the Enroll-HD natural history study (NCT01574053) and the GENERATION HD1 phase 3 clinical trial (NCT03761849) to model disease progression and placebo response for UHDRS scores, which are commonly used to evaluate disease progression in clinical trials. We included 8,071 Enroll-HD participants (mean baseline age: 51.4 years, 51.5% female) to develop a natural history progression model using baseline characteristics as predictive covariates. This model was then used to predict natural history progression of 260 participants from the GENERATION HD1 placebo arm (mean baseline age: 48.7 years, 43.5% female).The progression measured by Total Functional Capacity (TFC) in the GENERATION HD1 placebo arm aligned with predicted natural history (within 95% CI), indicating no significant placebo response. However, significant improvements (outside the 95% CI of the model) were observed after baseline for Total Motor Score (TMS), Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT) score, and Stroop Word Reading (SWR) score. The improvement in TMS persisted until the end of the dosing period (week 69), converging to natural history predictions at subsequent follow-up visits (weeks 85 and 101), suggesting a placebo effect. By contrast, cognitive scores (SDMT and SWR) showed sustained significant improvement (outside the 95% CI) up to the final follow-up visit at week 101, likely due to practice effects from the more frequent testing schedule in GENERATION HD1 compared with the annual assessments in Enroll-HD. Consequently, the composite UHDRS (cUHDRS) score, a linear combination of TFC, TMS, SDMT, and SWR, is influenced by both placebo and practice effects. Our results suggest that clinical scores in Huntington disease trials are susceptible to long-term placebo responses. These effects should be considered in future trial designs, especially when comparing trial data with natural history studies. Although based on the largest Huntington's trial, our results rely on limited placebo data and may not generalize to other trials with different populations, treatments, and designs.",Boareto M; Yamamoto Y; Sampaio C; McColgan P; Diack C; Ducray PS,Roche Pharma Research and Early Development (pRED); CHDI Management,

However, a greater understanding of stakeholder, including user, perspectives on JITAIs is needed. Focus groups with UK-based adult smokers (three groups; N = 19) and smoking cessation professionals (one group; N = 5) were conducted January-June 2024. Topic guides addressed the integration of a JITAI into users' lives, preferred content and features, and data and privacy. Transcripts were analysed using inductive and deductive Framework Analysis; deductive codes were derived from the Theoretical Domains Framework and the Technology Acceptance Model. Four co-equal major themes, ""Smoking Cessation Process"", ""JITAI Characteristics"", ""Perceived Value of the JITAI"", and ""Relationship with the JITAI"", and 16 subordinate themes were identified. The smoking cessation process was described as a challenging and idiosyncratic, non-linear journey during which a JITAI should provide consistent support. Preferences for specific JITAI characteristics varied. However, participants consistently expressed that a JITAI should be highly personalised and offer both immediate, interruptive support and ambient, in-depth content. The perceived usefulness and ease of use of a JITAI were described as central to its perceived value. Participants stressed that a JITAI would need to be convenient enough to easily integrate into users' daily lives, yet disruptive enough to facilitate behaviour change. Smokers expressed that they would want their relationship with a JITAI to feel supportive and non-judgmental. They also felt a JITAI should promote their autonomy. Smoking cessation professionals stressed the importance of privacy and data protection, whereas smokers appeared more ambivalent and had mixed opinions about this topic. JITAIs need to balance aspects of competing demands in their design, such as optimising for both convenience and sufficient disruption, promoting autonomy, and integrating interruptive and ambient content while also meeting stakeholder needs and expectations in terms of privacy.",,,

Infants eligible for nirsevimab immunization (born between 1 April, 2023, and 30 March, 2024) who were hospitalized due to RSV-related LRTI between September 25, 2023, and April 15, 2024, in a hospital from the Galician Public Health system were included. Clinical and demographic characteristics of RSV-related LRTI hospitalizations were analyzed, with comparisons made between breakthrough cases (those immunized with nirsevimab) and non-breakthrough cases. During the study period, 69 RSV-related LRTI hospitalizations were recorded, with a median hospital stay of 4 (interquartile range (IQR) 3-6) days; 65.2% (N = 45) were breakthrough cases. The median age was 2.7 (IQR 1.5-5.2) months, and more than half of them (N = 39, 56.5%) were male. The incidence of cases was parallel to the RSV epidemic curve, suggesting no waning of nirsevimab efficacy. Of the total hospitalizations, 16 infants (23.2%) had a high-risk condition, 44 (63.8%) needed oxygen support, 15 (21.7%) were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU), and 11 (15.9%) received non-invasive mechanical ventilation (NIMV). No statistically significant differences were observed in these characteristics when comparing breakthrough and non-breakthrough cases.

Many of these valuable molecules originate from traditional botanical pharmacopeias, repositories of centuries-old knowledge that are often underappreciated in modern research. This review highlights the medicinal plants identified in Sabah from 1922 to 2024, analyzing their taxonomical distribution, uses, utilization among ethnic groups, and their potential for clinical uses. The data for this review were gathered from Google Scholar, PubMed, ScienceDirect, Web of Science, PubMed, the Internet Archive, and Google Books. A keyword combination of ""Medicinal"" and ""Plants"" and ""Sabah"" yielded 21,700 results. Each result was examined, and articles that did not contain information relevant to the topic or came from non-peer-reviewed journals were excluded. Each of the remaining 87 selected articles was critically reviewed to extract pertinent information. A review of the available data indicates that 696 plant species are used in Sabah, including 412 angiosperms. These plants are primarily utilized to treat diseases or symptoms related to infections, digestive issues, injuries, and pains. Notably, 156 species employed by local Sabahan Dusunic, Murutic, and Kelabit ethnic groups remain unstudied in terms of their phytochemical and pharmacological properties, highlighting their potential for further investigation.

Chloroplasts are often chosen as attractive targets for the introduction of new agronomic traits because they have their own genome and protein synthesis machinery. Certain valuable traits have been genetically engineered into plastid genomes to improve crop yield, nutritional quality, resistance to abiotic and biotic stresses, and the production of industrial enzymes and therapeutic proteins. Synthetic biology approaches aim to play an important role in expressing multiple genes through plastid engineering, without the risk of pleiotropic effects in transplastomic plants. Despite many promising laboratory-level successes, no transplastomic crop has been commercialized to date. This technology is mostly confined to model species in academic laboratories and needs to be expanded to other agronomically important crop species to capitalize on its significant commercial potential. However, in recent years, some transplastomic lines are progressing in field trials, offering hope that they will pass regulatory approval and enter the marketplace. This review provides a comprehensive summary of new and emerging technologies employed for plastid transformation and discusses key synthetic biology elements that are necessary for the construction of modern transformation vectors.

Identifying distinct subphenotypes and understanding potential personalized modifications remain critical unmet needs. We applied unsupervised learning techniques to electronic medical records from UCSF to identify distinct Alzheimer's disease subphenotypes based on comorbidity profiles. We conducted enrichment analyses to determine cluster-specific comorbidities. Based on the observed sex-based differences, we subsequently conducted sex-stratified analyses to assess differences in disease manifestations between males and females. Findings were validated using an independent UC-Wide dataset. Among 8,363 patients, we identified five Alzheimer's disease subphenotypes, characterized by comorbidities related to cardiovascular conditions, gastrointestinal disorders, and frailty-related conditions such as pneumonia and pressure ulcers. Sex-stratified analyses revealed significant differences in comorbidity distributions across clusters. Notably, in Cluster 2, circulatory diseases were more prevalent among males, whereas in Cluster 3, bladder stones were more common among females. Key results were consistent across the UCSF and UC-Wide datasets. Our study identifies clinically meaningful Alzheimer's disease subphenotypes and highlights sex-specific variations, suggesting potential underlying biological factors such as Apolipoprotein E and gut microbiome alterations contributing to Alzheimer's disease heterogeneity. These findings underscore the need for further research into the biological mechanisms driving these differences and may inform the development of individualized therapeutic regimens.

Is the work of professionals in these fields subject to what some have called at recent industry conferences a failure of imagination? Are the tried-and-true methods and activities serving practitioners as well as they always have, or does today's world demand something different? The more important question is: In these conditions, how can crisis leaders do the most good? To answer that question, crisis management professionals may consider shifting their emphasis from planning, training and exercising alone and introducing more explicit focus on the delivery of good decision making - in other words, a transition of emphasis from response planning to more strategic programme management. All crises - whether fast burning, slow burning or creeping - require decision making. Ultimately in the aftermath, organisations and their leaders are judged not only on the outcomes of a crisis response, but on the decisions they made. Furthermore, this judgment is made not only on whether the decisions were right or wrong alone, but also whether they were defensible based on the best available information at the time. In confrontation with these realities, there is a unique role for enterprise crisis teams to define a value proposition along a set of guiding principles. From there, operational execution may be bridged through an integrated crisis management framework. This paper proposes a way forward along these lines.

In this systematic review we searched various databases (Clarivate Web of Science, EMBASE and Ovid Medline, Google Scholar, and PubMed) for publications containing the term ""clinical study report/s"", without restrictions. In the first part of this review we discussed the history of CSRs, their contents and structure, definitions, and relevant terminology. In this second part we discuss the uses of CSRs, concentrating on the individual benefits and harms of pharmacological interventions, and thus the benefit to harm balance. We also discuss adherence to interventions, prepublication of protocols of clinical trials, and how CSRs are written, factors that can all affect estimation of the benefit-harm balance. When clinical trial data from CSRs are compared with the data in published trial reports, the apparent benefits of pharmacological interventions are less impressive, and more information emerges about harms they can cause. Both of these effects change how the benefit-harm balance of a pharmacological intervention is estimated, generally making it less favourable than was otherwise thought. For more accurate assessment of the benefit-harm balance of an intervention, full, not abbreviated or synoptic, clinical study reports should continue to be made publicly available by regulatory authorities and manufacturers. Authorities that do not currently make them available should do so. CSRs should be introduced for assessment of surgical operations, therapeutic devices, and other non-pharmacological interventions in clinical trials.",,,jeffrey.aronson@phc.ox.ac.uk.

The imbalance between excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmissions may be implicated in the mechanism of action of ketamine. This study aimed to evaluate whether the ratio of glutamate and glutamine (Glx) to GABA levels at baseline in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) could predict ketamine response in patients with TRD. This exploratory study analyzed data from a double-blind randomized clinical trial with an open-label extension study (jRCTs031210124). Fifteen participants in the ketamine group and 15 of 16 participants in the placebo group received repeated intravenous ketamine during the double-blind and open-label extension periods, respectively. We measured Glx and GABA levels in the dACC before and after treatment during the double-blind period using proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS-17) was measured for depressive symptomatology. General linear models were used to examine the relationship between baseline Glx/GABA ratio and HDRS-17 score changes. Changes in HDRS-17 scores (mean (±SD)) following ketamine treatment were -4.9 (6.5) and -4.9 (5.2) in the double-blind and open-label periods, respectively. A higher baseline dACC Glx/GABA ratio was correlated with greater improvement in HDRS-17 (β = -0.42, p = 0.040). In the ketamine group, a reduction in the dACC Glx/GABA ratio was correlated with greater HDRS-17 improvement (β = 0.74, p = 0.009) with no such association in the placebo group. These results suggest that excitatory-inhibitory imbalance in the dACC may predict the efficacy of ketamine in TRD.",,,htani@keio.jp.

Disruption of redox homeostasis exacerbates ROS levels and instigates inflammation. Hypoxia-inducible factor 1 alpha (HIF-1α), essential for maintaining redox balance, is expressed in keratinocytes and plays a protective role in preserving the skin barrier. Stabilization of HIF-1α presents a potential therapeutic approach for UVR-induced sunburn. Our observations indicate that diosmetin inhibits the hydroxylation and ubiquitination of HIF-1α in UVR-induced sunburn. However, the precise mechanisms remain unclear. This study aims to elucidate the role and underlying mechanisms of diosmetin in the context of UVR-induced skin sunburn. In vivo UVR-induced sunburn mice models and in vitro UVR-exposed HaCaT cell models were established. We employed histopathological grade, oxidative stress assessment, ROS production measurement, and immunofluorescence staining of inflammatory markers to evaluate the activity of diosmetin. Additionally, RNA sequencing assay and co-immunoprecipitation assays were conducted to elucidate the underlying mechanisms. To verify the role of Rho Binding BTB Protein 3 (RhoBTB3), we performed intradermal injection rAAV-RhoBTB3-GFP to overexpress of RhoBTB3in mice. Diosmetin effectively inhibits the hydroxylation and ubiquitination of HIF-1α, resulting in significant antioxidative and anti-inflammatory effects in UVR-induced sunburn. RNA sequencing analysis and co-immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated that diosmetin reduces the formation of the RhoBTB3/PHD2 complex, thereby modulating the ubiquitination of HIF-1α and mitigating oxidative stress. Immunohistochemical analysis conducted on the wild-type and RhoBTB3-overexpressing mice revealed an enrichment of RhoBTB3, Prolyl Hydroxylase Domain protein 2 (PHD2), and HIF-1α in the epidermis. Notably, diosmetin stabilizes the HIF-1α protein and reduces oxidative stress by limiting the formation of the RhoBTB3/PHD2 complex in the epidermis of mice. Our study suggests that diosmetin acts as a regulator of the RhoBTB3/PHD2/HIF-1α axis to alleviate oxidative stress in sunburn, providing novel insights into potential treatments and mechanisms for sunburn.",,,zbs360@swu.edu.cn.

To date, none of the KIF5A variants was linked with dystonia. This study presents the first family with autosomal-dominant dystonia exhibiting incomplete penetrance, potentially linked to a KIF5A variant. Seven family members were recruited between 2017 and 2024. Detailed medical history and neurological examination were conducted for all. Genetic screening, including Sanger sequencing, MLPA analysis of SGCE, and PCR RFLP/BseRI for the common dystonia TOR1A mutation (c.907-909del), followed by whole exome sequencing, was performed on the proband and one affected relative. The genetic status of the remaining five individuals was assessed with Sanger sequencing. A missense variant in the KIF5A c.118G > A was found in four affected and one asymptomatic individual, while it was absent in two non-affected individuals. The variant is rare in the general population (0.00001 in gnomAD 4.0), affects a highly conserved amino acid, and in silico models (M-CAP) indicates it is pathogenic. It was classified as likely pathogenic per ACMG criteria (PM1, PM2, PP2, PP3). Our study suggests that KIF5A could represent a potential dystonia gene and sheds light on the broader role of motor proteins in human health and disease. This further expands the phenotypes associated with KIF5A and highlights the importance for clinicians to include this variant in their screening panels, as it tends to be underrepresented in current databases.",Wszolek ZK,Department of Neurology,Wszolek.Zbigniew@mayo.edu.

We report post-hoc analyses of pooled EGFR mutation tissue testing across osimertinib clinical trials, highlighting testing challenges and supporting best practice. Pooled central Cobas® EGFR Mutation Test data from nine global osimertinib NSCLC clinical trials were analyzed by specimen type, disease stage, and geographical region for specimen adequacy for testing and valid test results. Across 4,864 biopsies and 2,402 resections, 91% were adequate for testing, of which 95% of biopsies and 99% of resections had valid test results. Of biopsies, 12% were inadequate for testing (mainly due to insufficient tumor content [42%] and insufficient tissue volume [35%]) and 3% of resections were inadequate (insufficient tumor content [55%] and incorrect specimen preparation [12%]). Inadequacy varied by disease stage, from 3% in resectable stage IA2-IIIA to 10%-15% in first and second/later-line advanced/metastatic settings, and 16% in unresectable stage III. Test success rates among adequate specimens ranged from 93% (unresectable stage III) to 99% (resectable stage IA2-IIIA). Data were similar by geography. Most tissue specimens were adequate for EGFR testing. Inadequacy was commonly due to insufficient tissue volume or tumor content and higher in biopsies versus resections, and unresectable stage III and first-line advanced/metastatic versus other disease stages. Based on these controlled trial data, pre-analytic variables of tissue specimens are a major driver of testing success; hence maintaining optimal conditions from sample collection to biomarker analysis, as well as improving tissue-sampling techniques is critical to increase testing success rates.

40311117,Identification of Major Bleeding Events in Postoperative Patients With Malignant Tumors in Chinese Electronic Medical Records: Algorithm Development and Validation.,2025-05-02,JMIR formative research,10.2196/66189,"Postoperative bleeding is a serious complication following abdominal tumor surgery, but it is often not clearly diagnosed and documented in clinical practice in China. Previous studies have relied on manual interpretation of medical records to determine the presence of postoperative bleeding in patients, which is time-consuming and laborious. More critically, this manual approach severely hinders the efficient analysis of large volumes of medical data, impeding in-depth research into the incidence patterns and risk factors of postoperative bleeding. It remains unclear whether machine learning can play a role in processing large volumes of medical text to identify postoperative bleeding effectively. This study aimed to develop a machine learning model tool for identifying postoperative patients with major bleeding based on the electronic medical record system. This study used data from the available information in the National Health and Medical Big Data (Eastern) Center in Jiangsu Province of China. We randomly selected the medical records of 2,000 patients who underwent in-hospital tumor resection surgery between January 2018 and December 2021 from the database. Physicians manually classified each note as present or absent for a major bleeding event during the postoperative hospital stay. Feature engineering involved bleeding expressions, high-frequency related expressions, and quantitative logical judgment, resulting in 270 features. Logistic regression (LR), K-nearest neighbor (KNN), and convolutional neural network (CNN) models were developed and trained using the 1600-note training set. The main outcomes were accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) for each model. Major bleeding was present in 4.31% (69/1600) of the training set and 4.75% (19/400) of the test set. In the test set, the LR method achieved an accuracy of 0.8275, a sensitivity of 0.8947, a specificity of 0.8241, a PPV of 0.2024, an NPV of 0.9937, and an F1-score of 0.3301. The CNN method demonstrated an accuracy of 0.8900, sensitivity of 0.8421, specificity of 0.8924, PPV of 0.2807, NPV of 0.9913, and an F1-score of 0.4211. While the KNN method showed a high specificity of 0.9948 and an accuracy of 0.9575 in the test set, its sensitivity was notably low at 0.2105.

40309771,Chronic kidney disease enhances alternative pathway activity: a new paradigm.,2025-05-01,The Journal of clinical investigation,10.1172/JCI188353,"Reduced kidney function is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease in addition to kidney disease progression. Kidney disease is considered an inflammatory state, based on elevated levels of C-reactive protein and inflammatory cytokines. A key mediator of cardiovascular and kidney disease progression in the setting of reduced kidney function is systemic and vascular inflammation. However, the exact pathways that link chronic kidney disease (CKD) with inflammation remain incompletely understood. For decades it has been known that factor D, the main activator of the alternative complement pathway, is increased in the plasma of patients with reduced kidney function. Recent biomarker evidence suggests alternative pathway activation in this setting. CKD, therefore, seems to alter the balance of alternative pathway proteins, promoting inflammation and potentially exacerbating complement-mediated diseases and CKD-associated complications. In this manuscript, we review the impact of reduced kidney function on biomarkers of the alternative complement pathway and the implications of alternative pathway activation on cardiovascular disease and kidney disease progression. Importantly, we highlight the need for ongoing research efforts that may lead to opportunities to target the alternative pathway of complement withx the goal of improving kidney and cardiovascular outcomes in persons with reduced kidney function.",,,

In addition, diabetes is associated with a higher risk of developing chronic kidney disease, which is considered to be one of the strongest risk factors for CVD and mortality. To address the increased cardiovascular risk of patients with diabetes, dedicated screening strategies for CVD are necessary; conversely, screening for diabetes needs to be performed in all patients with CVD to allow timely identification. Once diabetes is diagnosed, rapid implementation of treatment with therapies to reduce cardiovascular risk on top of standard of care is necessary.

In recent years, there has been a shift toward incorporating patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) and patient-reported experience measures (PREMs) to capture service users' perspectives on treatment outcomes and experiences. The OMER-BE (Outcome Measurement and Evaluation as a Routine Practice in Alcohol and Other Drug Services in Belgium) study evaluates the acceptability and feasibility of PROMs and PREMs in different SUD treatment services, using the recently developed International Consortium for Health Outcomes Measurement Standard Set for Addictions. This paper presents the design and baseline characteristics of the study, indicators of attrition at 45-day follow-up, and the feasibility of the implementation of PROMs and PREMs in residential and outpatient services. A convenience sample of 189 treatment-seeking individuals with SUD from different inpatient (therapeutic communities and psychiatric centers) and outpatient treatment services was followed for six months. Sociodemographic characteristics; clinical factors; and PROMs including recovery strengths, quality of life, and global health were assessed at baseline and within 3 weeks after starting treatment. Additionally, PROMs and PREMs were measured 45, 90, and 180 days later. Comparisons were made between treatment modalities, and indicators of attrition at the 45-day follow-up were assessed using ANOVA and chi-square tests. Baseline differences were observed between the three treatment modalities regarding education, SUD treatment history, primary substance, and Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder Self-Report scores. Overall, patients in psychiatric treatment centers had a higher education level and less polysubstance use, while outpatients had fewer previous SUD treatments but received relatively more often opioid agonist treatment. Inpatients reported more attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder symptoms and higher SUD severity than outpatients. Additionally, recovery strength scores were significantly lower in the outpatient group compared to the other groups, particularly in the subdomains of ""Substance Use,"" ""Self-care,"" and ""Outlook on Life."" At the 45-day follow-up assessment, the attrition rate was 36.6%. Comparisons between participants who completed the 45-day follow-up and those who dropped out revealed that completers were significantly older, had a higher level of education, were more likely to live alone, and were more likely to have a mother born in Belgium. They also had higher average scores on the ""Material Resources"" domain of the Substance Use Recovery Evaluator, which includes questions about stable housing, a steady income, and effective financial management. Evaluating PROMs and PREMs appears to be feasible in a diverse group of treatment-seeking patients with SUD in Belgium. However, challenges remain for structural implementation in practice, especially in outpatient services. Routine monitoring of PROMs and PREMs has the potential to empower patients, service providers, and policy makers by providing a comprehensive understanding of service users' needs and treatment effectiveness.",Migchels C; Fernandez K; Antoine J; Matthys F; Crunelle CL,Department of Epidemiology and Public Health; Department of Psychiatry,

Eosinophils, which play a critical role in the pathophysiology of EGPA, require interleukin (IL)-5 for maturation in the bone marrow and migration to tissues. Glucocorticoids and immunosuppressants have been the cornerstone of treatment; however, their side effects have imposed a significant burden on many patients. Mepolizumab, an antibody that binds to and neutralizes IL-5, demonstrated efficacy in controlling disease activity in EGPA in the MIRRA trial conducted in 2017. In 2024, benralizumab, an IL-5 receptor alpha antagonist, was shown to be non-inferior to mepolizumab in efficacy against EGPA in the MANDARA trial. Both drugs were originally used for severe asthma and have benefited EGPA by reducing eosinophil counts. Due to differences in pharmacological structure and pharmacokinetics, the degree of eosinophil suppression varies between the two agents, and recent studies suggest that they may also affect inflammatory and homeostatic eosinophils differently.

Many models predicting bioactive peptide function or structure rely on their intrinsic properties, including the influence of amino acid composition, sequence, and chain length, which impact stability, folding, aggregation, and target interaction. Homology modelling predicts peptide structures based on known templates. Peptide-protein interactions can be explored using molecular docking techniques, but there are challenges related to the inherent flexibility of peptides, which can be addressed by more computationally intensive approaches that consider their movement over time, called molecular dynamics (MD). Virtual screening of many peptides, usually against a single target, enables rapid identification of potential bioactive peptides from large libraries, typically using docking approaches. The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) has transformed peptide discovery by leveraging large amounts of data. AlphaFold is a general protein structure prediction tool based on deep learning that has greatly improved the predictions of peptide conformations and interactions, in addition to providing estimates of model accuracy at each residue which greatly guide interpretation. Peptide function and structure prediction are being further enhanced using Protein Language Models (PLMs), which are large deep-learning-derived statistical models that learn computer representations useful to identify fundamental patterns of proteins. Recent methodological developments are discussed in the context of canonical peptides, as well as those with modifications and cyclisations.

This study aims to assess measles population immunity levels in China and investigate factors contributing to age-specific heterogeneities. We conducted a cross-sectional population-based serological study in southern China between June and October 2021. We determined the population mean antibody concentration and seroprevalence by age and over time, along with their associated determinants. Moreover, we estimated the contact-adjusted immunity levels by considering both age-specific immunity levels and population contact rates. Among the 1015 study participants (aged 0-95 years), the overall seroprevalence was estimated at 80.9% (95% confidence interval [CI], 78.3-83.3). When adjusting for the age-specific contact rates, the contact-adjusted immunity was estimated at 66.8% (95% CI, 56.6-75.1). Individuals younger than age 30 years showed significantly lower antibody concentration and seroprevalence (mean log concentration: 5.9, seroprevalence: 73.6% [95% CI, 69.9-77.3]) compared to those older than age 50 years (mean log concentration: 6.8, seroprevalence: 96.8% [95% CI, 94.7-98.9]). In particular, individuals born after the last SIA (2010) showed a significantly faster waning of immunity. Our findings highlight that immunity levels in the general population remain below the 95% threshold, underscoring the need for continued monitoring of immunity dynamics, especially for individuals born in a near-elimination setting and without subsequent SIAs.",,,

Demographic data and premonitory symptoms in cluster headache and migraine patients were analysed. The primary focus was on premonitory symptom presence and phenotype in cluster headache patients, with secondary analysis exploring associated factors and comparing spontaneous and nitroglycerin-triggered symptoms in cluster headache and migraine cohorts.ResultsAmong 164 cluster headache patients, 122/164 (74%) males, aged 45.9 ± 13.8 years (mean ± SD), 66/164 (40%) had chronic cluster headache and 32/164 (20%) had also comorbid migraine. Among them, 85% exhibited premonitory symptoms for which the presence was associated with oxygen treatment. No significant differences were found in symptom frequency between cluster headache and migraine cohorts or within spontaneous and nitroglycerin-triggered symptoms.ConclusionsThis study highlights recognizable spontaneous and nitroglycerin-triggered premonitory symptoms in cluster headache and factors potentially impacting cluster headache management, which may aid in tailoring treatment strategies for both conditions through the use of treatment prediction and early intervention.",,,
40302034,"Heparan-6-O-endosulfatase 2, a cancer-related proteoglycan enzyme, is effectively inhibited by a specific sea cucumber fucosylated glycosaminoglycan.",2025-05-07,Glycobiology,10.1093/glycob/cwaf025,"Heparan-6-O-endosulfatase 2 (Sulf-2) is a proteoglycan enzyme that modifies sulfation of heparan sulfate proteoglycans. Dysregulation of Sulf-2 is associated with various pathological conditions, including cancer, which makes Sulf-2 a potential therapeutic target. Despite the key pathophysiological roles of Sulf-2, inhibitors remain insufficiently developed. In previous work, a fucosylated chondroitin sulfate from the sea cucumber Holothuria floridana (HfFucCS) exhibited potent Sulf-2 inhibition. This study investigates the structural basis of HfFucCS-mediated Sulf-2 inhibition, examines the binding profile of HfFucCS to Sulf-2, and explores the mode of inhibition. Additionally, a structurally diverse library of sulfated poly/oligosaccharides, including common glycosaminoglycans and unique marine sulfated glycans, was screened for Sulf-2 inhibition. Results from a high-throughput arylsulfatase assay and specific 6-O-desulfation assay have proved that HfFucCS is the most potent among the tested sulfated glycans, likely due to the presence of the unique 3,4-disulfated fucose structural motif. HfFucCS demonstrated non-competitive inhibition, and inhibitory analysis of its low-molecular-weight fragments suggests a minimum length of ~7.5 kDa for effective inhibition. Surface plasmon resonance analyses revealed that Sulf-2 binds to surface heparin with high affinity (KD of 0.817 nM). HfFucCS and its derivatives effectively disrupt this interaction. Results from mass spectrometry-hydroxyl radical protein footprinting and repulsive scaling replica exchange molecular dynamics indicate similarities in the binding of heparin and HfFucCS oligosaccharides to both the catalytic and hydrophilic domains of Sulf-2. These findings reveal the unique inhibitory properties of a structurally distinct marine glycosaminoglycan, supporting its further investigation as a selective and effective inhibitor for Sulf-2-associated cancer events.",,,

The NADPH oxidase dual oxidase 2 (DUOX2) is upregulated in patients with IBD, yet its role in driving the disease remains unclear. We interrogated the functional consequences of epithelial DUOX2 activity for the host and microbiome. DUOX2 function was studied in mice with epithelial-specific DUOX2 overactivation (vTLR4), inactivation (vTLR4 DUOXA IEC-KO) and wild-type controls. We assessed the effect of dysbiosis on DUOX2 signalling and intestinal permeability (FITC-dextran, serum zonulin, bacterial translocation) with germ-free (GF) mice engrafted with IBD or healthy microbiota. RNA sequencing of colonic mucosa and microbiota and faecal metabolomics were used to characterise the host-microbe interface. Mechanistic studies were conducted in mouse colonoids, IBD biopsies and patient serum samples. DUOX2 activity increased permeability and bacterial translocation and induced subclinical inflammation in vTLR4 mice. GF vTLR4 mice had increased DUOX2 activity and permeability but no subclinical inflammation. In patients with IBD, DUOX2 expression was positively associated with plasma zonulin levels and negatively associated with ZO-1 expression. Engraftment of GF mice with IBD stool increased DUOX2 activity and triggered low-grade inflammation and permeability defects in mice. DUOX2 activity functionally altered the microbiome, reduced butyrate metabolism and promoted proinflammatory and pro-oncogenic bacterial metabolites. Butyrate and histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors blocked DUOX2 activation and reversed its effects. Elevated DUOX2 signalling contributes to epithelial barrier dysfunction, microbiome alterations and subclinical inflammation. Butyrate and HDAC inhibitors reversed these effects, indicating that DUOX2 may be a therapeutic target in IBD.",,,maria.abreu@cshs.org.
40300810,"Worldwide Regulatory Reliance: Results of an Executed Chemistry, Manufacturing and Control Post Approval Change Pilot.",,PDA journal of pharmaceutical science and technology,10.5731/pdajpst.2024-003023.1,"Post-approval changes (PACs) are integral to pharmaceutical product lifecycle management ensuring that the product remains safe, effective, and compliant with evolving standards. However, managing these changes across multiple regulatory jurisdictions remains a challenging endeavor due to diverse regulatory requirements and timelines across national regulatory authorities (NRAs). This results in delays obtaining approval from NRAs, impacting global supply chains, and ultimately jeopardizing timely access of essential medical products to patients. In 2021, the WHO issued the Good Reliance Practices (GReIP) guidance to encourage streamlined PAC review and approval process while maintaining access to quality-assured, safe, and effective medicinal products. NRAs are encouraged to rely on the assessment completed by a reference authority that agrees to provide the outcomes of its regulatory expertise. The ultimate objective of this guidance is to accelerate the overall process for PACs, ultimately fostering more equitable and timely access of medical products to populations who need them. This approach was tested in a CMC PAC pilot to determine the feasibility of using the principles of regulatory reliance based on the recommendations outlined in the GReIP with the goal of establishing a predictable, 6-month approval timeframe across multiple NRAs. The design and management of this pilot is described in Gastineau et al.This paper describes the outcomes of the pilot which demonstrates that regulatory reliance is feasible. Of the 21 Regulatory NRAs that agreed to participate, 55% were able to complete the review within 6 months; within 10 months, 95% of approvals were received and, after 16 months, all participating countries had approved the PAC. The use of a Q&A SharePoint Tool allowed for visibility of the questions raised and company responses amongst NRAs. Feedback on this reliance pilot was solicited from the participating NRAs and provides further support for future CMC PAC reliance cases.",Ban C; Graham J; Le Palaire L; Persaud P; Brehme F; Faure O; Rameau A; Silva AL,Sanofi,Cynthia.ban@sanofi.com

This modeling approach can assist with biopharmaceutics risk assessment and the establishment of patient centric, clinically relevant drug product specifications. However, the variability of possible model strategies and the existence of gaps in scientific knowledge associated with the lack of standardized regulatory expectations for model parametrization, data requirements for model development, and criteria for fit-for-purpose model validation leads to varied acceptance rates and frequent requests for additional information and deficiencies in PBBM submissions across regulatory agencies. During the 2023 Maryland Center of Excellence in Regulatory Science and Innovation (M-CERSI) PBBM Best Practices for Drug Product Quality: Regulatory and Industry Perspectives workshop, it was identified that a PBBM report template summarizing model considerations and proposing a structure for presenting question(s) of interest, model context, input data, a modeling plan, and validation would be beneficial for both industry and regulatory agencies. The present work is not a regulatory guideline but rather a summary of current best practices and considerations for PBBM submissions.

Industrial extraction of antibiotics from fermentation broth using organic solvents raises various environmental and health concerns. In this study, a thermosensitive polymer, NPE-108, was used to construct an aqueous two-phase system (ATPS) for the extraction of spiramycin. We used Gromacs software to develop a molecular dynamics simulation model to reveal the distribution mechanism of spiramycin molecules in the NPE-108/water ATPS from a microscopic perspective. Additionally, we examined the effects of volume ratio, temperature, and pH on extraction through experimentation. Under the optimal conditions for forward extraction, the distribution coefficient and extraction efficiency were 25.3 and 89.9%, respectively. Under the optimal conditions for back extraction, the distribution coefficient and extraction efficiency were 6.8 and 81.5%, respectively. Optimization of crystallization conditions resulted in a crystal yield of 88.1% and a purity of 98.4%.

MRIs are historically performed post-operatively and/or at treatment planning. Continuous interfractional changes during CRT have not been adequately characterized. MR-guided radiation therapy (MRgRT) allows for detailed imaging of tumor volumes during the course of treatment. This is a preliminary initial report evaluating temporal and spatial changes that occur in GBM, in order to model tumor dynamics. Five GBM patients enrolled onto an institutional biorepository registry underwent treatment with our 0.35T MRgRT workflow. Target volumes were delineated based on T2/FLAIR (GTV_46Gy) and T1 gadolinium-enhanced MR (GTV_14Gy) sequences. Weekly post-contrast MRIs were performed during CRT with the 0.35T magnet to monitor target volume dynamics. Thirty-five MR scans were evaluated. The median time from surgery to CRT was 32 days (range: 28-40), with a median of 13 days (range: 12-14) from simulation to CRT. We found median volume reductions of 40.0% (range: 8.3-86.5%), and 37.1% (range: 15.0-67.5%) for GTV_46Gy and GTV_14Gy, respectively. The bulk of these changes occurred early, within the first 3 weeks of the 6-week treatment, with significant reductions observed between baseline and week 1 -32.6% for GTV_46Gy and 17.9% for GTV_14Gy. Separately, statistically significant volume reductions for the cavity volume (F = 59.43, p < 0.05) were observed. Compared to baseline, centroid migrations of the target volumes were also noted: the median GTV_46Gy centroid migration was 7.4 mm (range: 2.0-10.8 mm) and the median GTV_14Gy centroid migration was 3.6 mm (range: 1.3-8.8 mm). Our pilot study suggests that weekly MRgRT imaging for GBM patients undergoing long course CRT reveals significant GTV reductions and centroid migrations, especially during the first 3 weeks of treatment. A more detailed understanding of which patients are at highest risk for tumor change and migration is needed to best apply these imaging parameters to clinical practice.",,,rupeshk@baptisthealth.net.

First line therapies for localized GA include topical and intralesional corticosteroids. Systemic corticosteroids have been used for generalized; however, rates of partial and complete resolution are disappointing. Recent advances in understanding the pathophysiology of macrophage activation and granuloma formation have led to Janus Kinase (JAK) inhibition as a therapeutic target for GA. The objectives of our study were to provide insight into the pathophysiology of GA and describe the clinical course and findings in patients with GA on JAK inhibitor therapy. This is a retrospective case series of 9 adults (age ≥ 18 years) with a diagnosis of GA and concomitant use of an oral JAK inhibitor. All patients on oral JAK inhibitor therapy (upadacitinib or abrocitinib) had improvement and/or clearance of their GA lesions within the first three months of therapy. Few adverse events commonly implicated in JAK inhibitor therapy (e.g., URI symptoms, malaise, acne) were reported. This study is limited by small sample size. JAK inhibitor therapy can be used in patients with GA, especially if they failed other treatments. Furthermore, JAK inhibitor therapy resulted in faster clearance time compared to other conventional treatments (e.g., antimicrobials, antimalarials, apremilast, methotrexate, and anti-tumor necrosis factor inhibitors). Depending on extent of GA involvement and patient-provider preferences, oral JAK inhibition therapy can be used off-label.

However, trial protocols vary in their completeness and often do not address key elements of design and conduct. The SPIRIT (Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Interventional Trials) statement was first published in 2013 as guidance to improve the completeness of trial protocols. Periodic updates incorporating the latest evidence and best practices are needed to ensure that the guidance remains relevant to users. Here, we aimed to systematically update the SPIRIT recommendations for minimum items to address in the protocol of a randomized trial. We completed a scoping review and developed a project-specific database of empirical and theoretical evidence to generate a list of potential changes to the SPIRIT 2013 checklist. The list was enriched with recommendations provided by lead authors of existing SPIRIT/CONSORT (Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials) extensions (Harms, Outcomes, Non-pharmacological Treatment) and other reporting guidelines (TIDieR). The potential modifications were rated in a three-round Delphi survey followed by a consensus meeting. Overall, 317 individuals participated in the Delphi consensus process and 30 experts attended the consensus meeting. The process led to the addition of two new protocol items, revision to five items, deletion/merger of five items, and integration of key items from other relevant reporting guidelines. Notable changes include a new open science section, additional emphasis on the assessment of harms and description of interventions and comparators, and a new item on how patients and the public will be involved in trial design, conduct and reporting. The updated SPIRIT 2025 statement consists of an evidence-based checklist of 34 minimum items to address in a trial protocol, along with a diagram illustrating the schedule of enrollment, interventions and assessments for trial participants. To facilitate implementation, we also developed an expanded version of the SPIRIT 2025 checklist and an accompanying explanation and elaboration document.

However, protection has eroded over time due to the emergence of antigenically diverse viral variants, especially the Omicron subvariants. One successful platform for the generation of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines are recombinant spike protein vaccines, of which two are licensed in the United States and Europe. Typically, purified recombinant protein antigens are poorly immunogenic and adjuvants must be included in the formulation. Here, we adjuvanted recombinant ancestral SARS-CoV-2 Wuhan-Hu-1 spike proteins with an emulsion formulation combined with synthetic Toll-like receptor (TLR) 4 and 7/8 agonists. This combination led to the induction of a Th1-skewed immune response that included high titers of antibodies against Wuhan-Hu-1 spike. These serum antibodies included neutralizing and cross-reactive antibodies that recognized the spike from multiple SARS-CoV-2 variants, as well as the receptor binding domain (RBD) from SARS-CoV-1. Despite an absence of robust cross-neutralization, vaccination against Wuhan-Hu-1 spike in the context of TLR-containing emulsions provided complete cross-protection against disease from a lethal challenge with XBB.1 in a stringent K18-hACE2 mouse model. We believe that the combination of recombinant spike antigens with TLR agonist-based emulsion formulations could lead to the development of next-generation SARS-CoV-2 vaccines that provide significant protection from future emerging variants.",,,jay.evans@mso.umt.edu.

To investigate the risk of PMR after COVID-19 vaccination using self-controlled case series (SCCS) analysis METHODS: We used the National Health Insurance Database, linked with the COVID-19 registry between February 2021 and August 2023, to identify adults aged 50 years or older who received at least one dose of COVID-19 vaccine and subsequently diagnosed with PMR within the observation period, defined as 240 days after the first dose of vaccine. The risk window was defined as 28 days after each dose of COVID-19 vaccination, and the control window encompassed the remainder of the observation period. Incidence rate ratios (IRRs) were estimated using conditional Poisson regression with 95% CIs, stratified by dose and vaccine type. Among 44 818 078 COVID-19 vaccine recipients, 376 patients were diagnosed with PMR. The analysis indicated that COVID-19 vaccination was not associated with an increased risk of PMR (IRR, 0.74; 95% CI 0.59 to 0.94). Rather, the risk of PMR was slightly reduced after the first dose (0.52; 0.34 to 0.79), with no significant association with other doses of COVID-19 vaccine (0.83; 0.59 to 1.16 for second dose, 0.77, 0.48 to 1.25 for third dose). In this nationwide SCCS, there was no association with the increased risk of PMR following COVID-19 vaccination.

We used the 2016-2019 US National Inpatient Sample data that contain all hospitalisation data. In people with a diagnosis of SLE, we assessed the multivariable adjusted ORs (aORs) to examine the association of rural patient residence with MI hospitalisation, while adjusting for demographics, payer, income, hospital characteristics and the Deyo-Charlson Comorbidity Index. We found that the crude rates of patients hospitalised with MI per 100 000 area specific SLE hospitalisations were higher in rural versus urban residents with SLE, 2265 versus 1435 (p value<0.001). In the multivariable-adjusted model that accounted for demographics, insurance payer, household income, comorbidities and hospital characteristics including geographical location, we found that rural residence was associated with an aOR of 1.98 (95% CI, 1.71 to 2.29; reference category, urban residence) of MI hospitalisations in people with SLE. Other factors significantly associated with the risk of MI were male sex, Medicaid or private insurance, urban not teaching or urban teaching hospital, Midwest region and a private hospital control, either for profit or not for profit. Rural residence doubled the risk of MI hospitalisation in people with SLE independent of demographics, payer status, social determinants of health and hospital characteristics. Our study highlights the disproportionate effect of rurality on health outcomes in people with SLE within the USA and a clear rural-urban gap disparity.

QST results complied with Aẟ- und C-fiber damage, including increased cold, warmth and mechanical detection thresholds, higher thermal sensory limen and allodynia. Intraepidermal nerve fiber densities were low in 7 / 17 children. This resulted in a great impact on physical quality of life and pain scales but not on social life. Five children showed heterozygous variants of unknown significance (VUS) in genes encoding VGSC (SCN9A, n=2; SCN10A, n=3) with maternal or paternal inheritance in two and one patient, respectively. Three further patients showed likely disease-associated variants in the HUWE1, TRIO and PYGM genes. Despite a high disease burden and small fiber damage indicated by QST and skin histology, only VUS in VGSC and additional monogenic causes of pain symptoms outside of VGSC genes were identified. Genetic studies in affected children should therefore be comprehensive, not restricted to VGSC variants and be supplemented by a detailed clinical workup. In silico modelling and future functional studies might help to identify VUS that play a role in altered pain perception.",Quade A; Hageb Z; Rolke R; Dohrn M; Schacht G; Weis J; Häusler M,Department of Pediatrics; Department of Palliative Medicine; Department of Neurology; Department of Neuropathology,

We analyzed the coagulation potential of emicizumab combined with warfarin in a simulated model of PwHA. Nineteen samples were collected from ten patients taking warfarin, and the prothrombin time-international normalized ratio (PT-INR) was used to define near-normal (INR 1.2-1.48; n = 4), subtherapeutic (INR 1.56-1.9; n = 7) and therapeutic (INR > 2.0; n = 8) groups. Factor (F)VIII activity (FVIII:C) was neutralized using an anti-FVIII inhibitor antibody (termed FVIII-depleted) before the addition of emicizumab (50 µg/mL). Coagulation potential was measured using Ca2 + -triggered rotational thromboelastometry, and was compared with that in emicizumab-treated PwHA. The average PT-INR in the near-normal, subtherapeutic, and therapeutic groups was 1.3 ± 0.1, 1.7 ± 0.1, and 2.4 ± 0.3, respectively. The hemostatic potential in FVIII-depleted samples mixed with emicizumab in the near-normal group was comparable to that in emicizumab-treated PwHA. The coagulation potential in FVIII-depleted samples after addition of emicizumab in the subtherapeutic and therapeutic groups were lower than that in emicizumab-treated PwHA.

With increasing economic growth, rising life expectancy, and rapid technological advancements, the healthcare needs of the population have surged. This is particularly evident with the rise in chronic diseases, growing healthcare awareness, and the growing demand for personalized care and treatment. Medical devices, which encompass a wide range of machines, instruments, apparatus, and even software, play a vital role in diagnosing, treating, preventing, monitoring, and providing palliative care for various health conditions. Examples include X-ray machines, pacemakers, hip implants, ultrasound machines, glucose metres, prosthetics, and defibrillators. These devices are indispensable in the healthcare continuum across India. However, the development of India's medical device industry faces significant challenges, including limited infrastructure, outdated regulatory frameworks, and an inability to support sustainable growth. The Johnson & Johnson hip implant scandal highlighted the gaps in the existing regulatory system. The current Drugs and Cosmetics Act of 1940 (DCA, 1940) is inadequate in defining medical devices, regulating their import and manufacture, ensuring patient safety, managing adverse event reporting, and holding medical device companies accountable. To address these issues, the Medical Device Rules was introduced by the Government of India in 2017 (MDR, 2017). However, there has been a long-standing need for a more comprehensive legislative framework specifically for medical devices. To this end, the new Drugs, Medical Devices, and Cosmetics Bill of 2022 was proposed to substitute the outdated 1940 Act. This doctrinal research critically examines the shortcomings of the current DCA,1940 vis-à-vis the case study of Johnson & Johnson hip implant issue and provides a comparative analysis of this Act with the newly proposed Drugs, Medical Devices, and Cosmetics Bill of 2022.",,,ashishbaldi@mrsptu.ac.in.

Naproxen (NAP), a poorly water-soluble drug, was selected as a model compound to assess the drug-loading capacity of the synthesized CDNSs. The effect of each reaction parameter on NAP integration into the CDNSs was examined at varying weight ratios. The optimal reaction conditions were determined to be a solubilization time of 6 h, an ECH/CD molar ratio of 8/1, and an NaOH concentration of 33%. Under these conditions, the NAP loading efficiency of α-CDNSs was calculated as 67.12%. Comparative analysis revealed that α-CDNSs outperformed β-CDNSs in terms of drug-loading capacity.

One promising approach to address these challenges is the dietary supplementation of non-digestible oligosaccharides (NDOs). NDOs, including human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs), play a vital role in shaping and sustaining a healthy gut microbiota. Beyond stimulating the growth and activity of beneficial gut bacteria, NDOs can also interact directly with pathogenic bacteria and viruses. Their antiviral and antibacterial properties arise from their unique interactions with pathogens and their ability to modulate the host's immune system. NDOs can function as decoy receptors, inhibit pathogen growth, bind to bacterial toxins, stimulate the host immune response, exhibit anti-biofilm properties, and enhance barrier protection. However, a notable gap exists in the comprehensive assessment of in vivo and clinical data on this topic. This review aims to provide an in-depth overview of the in vivo evidence related to the antiviral and antibacterial effects of various NDOs and HMOs, with a focus on discussing their possible mechanisms of action.",Nauta A; Groeneveld A,FrieslandCampina,

Its pathogenesis may be related to T cell-mediated autoimmune attack on hair follicles. Its clinical manifestations are mostly round or oval patches of AA, which can progress to Alopecia Totalis (AT) and Alopecia Universalis (AU). In severe cases, it affects the psychological health and quality of life of patients. In the past, the treatment of AA mainly relied on intra-lesional or systemic application of glucocorticoids, minoxidil or immunomodulators, which had problems such as limited efficacy and high recurrence rate. Some studies have also found that JAK inhibitors have improved effects on many autoimmune diseases, including AA. This case report presents a patient with AA who achieved significant therapeutic effects from treatment with Tofacitinib Citrate Sustained-Release Tablets, manufactured by Qilu Pharmaceutical Company in China. Due to the recurrence rate of AA, patients are likely to need long-term medication. The resulting economic burden cannot be ignored. We therefore investigated the mechanisms and economic benefits of various JAK inhibitors in the treatment of AA, in order to provide better guidance to patients with recurring disease who need long-term medication, and to their doctors in choosing a more rational therapeutic agent according to the patient's condition and economic status.",,,

Levodopa (l-dopa) is a mainstay of therapy and is typically followed by the addition of a catechol- A medical research summary on how use the drug safinamide in Asian patients with Parkinson’s disease Parkinson’s disease is a growing problem in Asia as populations age. The treatment approach in Asia is similar to other parts of the world, even though Parkison’s disease might affect Asian patients differently. A common treatment is Levodopa (L-dopa), often combined with other drugs to address ‘wear-off’ effects, which occur when L-dopa stops working before the next dose. This article focuses on safinamide, a drug used with L-dopa to manage Parkinson’s disease. Asian neurologists reviewed studies to find the best ways to use safinamide in Asian patients. Research shows that safinamide helps reduce wear-off effects, improves movement, and eases some non-movement symptoms like bladder issues and sleep problems. Safinamide is well tolerated, works well for older patients, and may lower the risk of unwanted movements (dyskinesias) in long-term treatment. The authors recommend safinamide as an option for managing Parkinson’s disease in Asian patients. However, they call for more research on its effects on pain, the right doses, and how it works for younger patients with Parkinson’s disease.",,,

This framework, in addition to the crystalline structure of cellulosic fibers and the rigidity of lignin, makes lignocellulosic biomass (LCB) highly recalcitrant to degradation. Xylanases are glycoside hydrolases that cleave the β-1,4-glycoside linkages in the xylan backbone and have attracted increasing attention due to their potential uses in various industrial sectors such as pulp and paper, baking, pharmaceuticals, and lignocellulosic biorefining. For decades, the measurement of xylanase activity was based on reducing sugar quantification methods like DNS or Nelson/Somogyi assays, with numerous limitations in terms of specificity and interference from other enzymatic activities. A better alternative is the colorimetric Azo-Xylan assay, which specifically measures the endo-1,4-β-D-xylanase activity. In this study, the Azo-Xylan protocol was adapted from the company Megazyme to determine the enzymatic activity of thermostable xylanases produced by microbial consortia (i.e., microbiomes), aiming to determine biochemical features such as temperature and pH optima, thermostability, and shelf life. This modified approach offers a rapid, cost-effective, and highly specific method for the determination of xylanase activity in complex mixtures, helping the development of a xylanase-based method for the hydrolysis of hard-degrading substrates in bio-based industries.

Consequently, high quality evidence for anticancer drug dosing in reduced kidney function is limited and no internationally agreed guidelines exist to inform prescribing decisions in this population. A methodology for guideline development was applied which did not require availability of RCTs but used critical appraisal of existing observational literature and group consensus. An international multidisciplinary working group (n = 38) established consensus recommendations in two parts to form the International Consensus Guideline on Anticancer Drug Dosing in Kidney Dysfunction (ADDIKD). The approach enabled virtual participation worldwide. In Part 1 we developed a standardised approach for assessment and classification of kidney function in patients with cancer using global nephrology standards and working group expertise. Part 2 involved a comprehensive literature search of 59 anticancer drugs followed by a critical appraisal of the evidence certainty through the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) process and development of dosing recommendations in reduced kidney function. Key external stakeholders (n = 9) invited expert contributors (n = 25), and the working group participated in virtual interactive workshops to vote on the acceptability of these recommendations. The participants were provided with evaluation of the literature, and they engaged in several rounds of virtual discussion (involving robustness of the evidence behind recommendations and their real-world application) and anonymous consensus voting. Adapting the ADDIKD guideline development process to a virtual format enabled engagement with a very broad base of specialised international experts especially during the global pandemic. Combining GRADE methodology with consensus-building approaches was an effective method of producing recommendations (in an area lacking RCTs) by merging critical review of the literature with expert opinion and clinical practice.

KDIGO guidelines have been adopted by most internal medicine specialities for the assessment and classification of kidney function, but not by cancer medicine. The development of the International Consensus Guideline on Anticancer Drug Dosing in Kidney Dysfunction (ADDIKD) aims to overcome the perceived challenges with KDIGO recommendations by describing their utility in patients with cancer. Two virtual, consensus building workshops were held consecutively, involving international, multidisciplinary participants (Part 1 of ADDIKD development). During these workshops, three consensus recommendations were agreed upon based on KDIGO's principles; to standardise kidney function assessment, classify kidney function, and determine a uniform approach to dose anticancer drugs in patients with reduced kidney function. Cancer clinicians attending the workshops identified issues regarding the adoption of KDIGO's recommendations. These issues were addressed by nephrologists, clinical pharmacologists, and other clinicians with extensive experience in the contemporary assessment of kidney function. The key concern for cancer specialists was a hesitancy to move away from the familiar and long-standing practice of using the Cockcroft-Gault equation to estimate creatinine clearance. The consensus building within the two multidisciplinary workshops allowed a thorough assessment of the evidence and clarified how directly measured GFR and eGFR, rather than creatinine clearance, could be optimally utilised in cancer care. The development of Part 1 of the ADDIKD guideline represents a standardised, contemporary approach to the assessment, classification, and utility of kidney function in the setting of cancer care and it harmonises with the approach used in other areas of medicine internationally.

Of 183 patients with informed consent, 164 were treated with brexpiprazole 1 or 2 mg/day for 14 weeks (prior brexpiprazole subgroup: 102 patients, prior placebo subgroup: 62 patients), and the overall study completion rate was 71.3%. The overall incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events was 90.2% (in each subgroup, 90.2% and 90.3%, respectively). Most treatment-emergent adverse events were mild or moderate in severity, and no new safety signals were observed. Regarding the Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory total score at Week 14 (last observation carried forward), the mean change from baseline (standard deviation) was -4.0 (9.8). The extended 14-week treatment with brexpiprazole 1 or 2 mg/day after 10-week treatment was generally well tolerated in Japanese patients with agitation associated with dementia due to Alzheimer's disease, and the efficacy was maintained.",Adachi J; Hirota N; Iba K; Shimizu K; Nakai M; Mori N; Takahashi K,Department of Medical Affairs; Headquarters of Clinical Development,
40290585,Quantifying the Unknowns of Plaque Morphology: The Role of Topological Uncertainty in Coronary Artery Disease.,,Mayo Clinic proceedings. Digital health,10.1016/j.mcpdig.2025.100217,"This article aimed to explore topological uncertainty in medical imaging, particularly in assessing coronary artery calcification using artificial intelligence (AI). Topological uncertainty refers to ambiguities in spatial and structural characteristics of medical features, which can impact the interpretation of coronary plaques. The article discusses the challenges of integrating AI with topological considerations and the need for specialized methodologies beyond traditional performance metrics. It highlights advancements in quantifying topological uncertainty, including the use of persistent homology and topological data analysis techniques. The importance of standardization in methodologies and ethical considerations in AI deployment are emphasized. It also outlines various types of uncertainty in topological frameworks for coronary plaques, categorizing them as quantifiable and controllable or quantifiable and not controllable. Future directions include developing AI algorithms that incorporate topological insights, establishing standardized protocols, and exploring ethical implications to revolutionize cardiovascular care through personalized treatment plans guided by sophisticated topological analysis. Recognizing and quantifying topological uncertainty in medical imaging as AI emerges is critical. Exploring topological uncertainty in coronary artery disease will revolutionize cardiovascular care, promising enhanced precision and personalization in diagnostics and treatment for millions affected by cardiovascular diseases.",Singh Y; Erickson B; Lopez-Jimenez F,Department of Cardiovascular Medicine; Department of Radiology,

The secondary objective was to assess the stability of TTs and the effect of management advice on changes in traits and health outcomes. Data from the Dutch asthma/COPD service (2007-2023) were studied retrospectively. Patients ≥18 years with asthma, COPD, or Asthma-COPD overlap (ACO) were included. The prevalence of eight TTs were assessed: 1) insufficient inhaler technique, 2) poor medication adherence, 3) blood eosinophilia, 4) smoking, 5) obesity, 6) physical inactivity, 7) reversible airflow limitation, and 8) anxiety and/or depression. The effect of management advice on TTs was evaluated for patients with a follow-up visit scheduled within 1-2 years. In total, 15246 patients (COPD n=4822; ACO n=1761, asthma n=8663) were included. The highest proportions of TTs were insufficient inhaler technique: 43.6% (95% CI: 42.9-44.4), followed by poor medication adherence: 40.3% (95% CI: 39.2-41.4) and blood eosinophilia: 36.9% (95% CI: 35.8-38.1). Overall, 83.3% of patients had ≥ 1 TTs, and 48.9% of patients ≥ 2 TTs. Among patients with blood eosinophilia, a significant reduction of the trait at follow-up (OR: 0.61, 95% CI: 0.39; 0.96) and improved health status were observed when the pulmonologist advised the general practitioner to initiate or increase the dose of ICS. No significant association was found between management advice and the exacerbation rate at follow-up. The TTs assessed in this study are common in primary care patients, with nearly half of the patients showing a combination of at least two TTs. These TTs coexist in many different combinations. A personalized approach targeting these traits may be effective in achieving better control of these heterogeneous diseases.",Meijer RJ,Ommelander Ziekenhuis Groningen (OZG),

Americas,10.1016/j.lana.2025.101090,"Chagas disease, caused by the protozoan parasite  We used RNA sequencing to analyse the gene expression changes in the peripheral blood of six patients with Chagas disease with early structural heart disease, four patients with Chagas disease without any signs or symptoms of disease, thirteen patients without Chagas disease with early structural heart disease, and ten patients without Chagas disease or signs of heart disease. Pathway analyses and immune cell deconvolution were employed to further elucidate the biological processes underlying early CCC development. Our analysis suggests that early CCC is associated with a downregulation of various peripheral immune response genes, including changes suggestive of reduced antigen presentation and T cell activation. Notably, these genes and processes appear to be distinct from those of non-Chagas cardiomyopathies. This work highlights the potential importance of the immune response in early CCC, providing insight into the early pathogenesis of this disease and how it may differ from other cardiomyopathies. The changes we have identified may serve as biomarkers of early CCC and could inform future longitudinal cohort studies of markers of disease progression and strategies for the treatment of CCC in its early stages.

Using a new statistical methodology, we explored the link between an inactivated quadrivalent influenza vaccine's impact on HI antibody titers and its effectiveness against A/H1N1-associated influenza illness. We utilized data from a phase 3, observer-blind, randomized, controlled trial in children aged 6-35 months to assess HI antibody titers as an immune CoP. The assessment used a statistical method developed within a causal inference framework and a new information-theoretic metric of surrogacy, the so-called individual causal association (ICA). The 75% and 85% uncertainty intervals of the ICA are 0.5511-0.8282 and 0.3632-0.8684, respectively, indicating a substantial reduction in the uncertainty about the vaccine's effect on the absence of infection when its impact on the HI antibody titers is known.

The full value of this approach will be realized by taking these processes to the production scale; however, achieving this goal will require a better understanding of the influence of mass transport on reaction behavior and the interactions between reactive species and electrodes inherent to organic electrosynthesis. The limited options for cell geometries used on small scale limit elucidation of these features. Here, we show how advanced cell geometries allow us to control the interplay between reaction mechanism and mass transport, leading to improved performance of three modern organic electrosynthetic reactions.

Thanks to its different techno-functional characteristics, such as solubility, emulsification, gelling and foaming, it has been widely exploited in food manufacturing. Also, advances in processing technologies have enabled the industrial production of a variety of whey-based products exerting biological activities. The beneficial properties of whey proteins (WPs) include their documented effects on cardiovascular, digestive, endocrine, immune and nervous systems, and their putative role in the prevention and treatment of non-communicable diseases (NCDs). In this regard, research on their application for health enhancement, based on the optimization of product formulation and the development of pharmaceuticals, is highly relevant. Beyond the health and nutritionally relevant effects as in in vivo animal studies, the allergenicity of WPs and WP hydrolysates is also herein tackled and discussed, as well as their potential role as therapeutics for immune tolerance and so-called tolerogenic effects. Grounded on the WPs' health-promoting functions, this paper presents the latest research showing the potential of whey-derived peptides as an alternative strategy in NCD treatment. This work also reports a careful analysis of their current use, also revealing which obstacles limit their full exploitation, thus highlighting the future challenges in the field.

40289640,Expansion of a Pharmacokinetic Model for Diazepam to Characterize Real-World IV and Oral Data in Children With and Without Obesity.,,Journal of clinical pharmacology,10.1002/jcph.70027,"Diazepam is a benzodiazepine approved for use in adults and children. The label incorporates recommended dosing for status epilepticus in children. Published population pharmacokinetic (PK) modeling recommends an intravenous bolus dose of 0.2 mg/kg capped at 8 mg to reach the suggested target exposure of 200-600 ng/mL at 10 min post dose in children up to 17 years of age. This model was developed for children generally without obesity based on IV data, and it is unclear how increased body weight may affect exposure or target attainment given capped dosing. Diazepam concentrations after IV or oral administration for 61 children aged 2.5 to 20.6 years were used to externally evaluate the model including the addition of fixed oral absorption parameters. Then, PK parameters were re-estimated with the external population alone and again in combination with the original population. Re-estimated parameters from the combined population were used to simulate recommended dosing for children with and without obesity. The external dataset included 88 plasma concentrations from 61 children (54 with obesity) receiving diazepam per standard of care. The external evaluation resulted in 34.5% of predicted values within 30% of the observed concentration. Parameter re-estimation resulted in increased central volume of distribution (26% increase from a previous model), reduced peripheral volume of distribution and intercompartmental clearance, and similar clearance estimates. Simulations demonstrated that dosing caps may prevent children with obesity from reaching the suggested target exposure that is recommended for the treatment of status epilepticus. Further study is needed to evaluate the target exposure range in this population.",Anderson SG; Payne EH; Turdalieva S; ,; The Emmes Company,

Potassium-competitive acid blockers (P-CABs) are novel acid-suppressive drugs that have emerged as potential alternatives. We evaluated the effectiveness of P-CAB in reducing the risk of UGI bleeding in patients receiving DAPT after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). This retrospective cohort study included patients with PCI on DAPT between January 2019 and January 2023 using the Korean nationwide health claims database. The primary outcome was admission for UGI bleeding within 6 months of PCI. A multivariate Cox regression model was used to evaluate UGI bleeding risk based on PPIs and P-CAB use. Of the 210 447 patients who underwent PCI on DAPT (mean age, 65.5 years; 74.7% men), 4.6% and 47.5% patients were prescribed P-CABs and PPIs, respectively. Overall, 0.3% of patients experienced UGI bleeding within 6 months of PCI. P-CAB users had a reduced risk of UGI bleeding (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.59; 95% confidence interval, 0.38-0.92; p = 0.019) compared with patients not receiving P-CAB or PPI. No significant difference was observed between the P-CAB and PPI users (p > 0.05). Among Korean patients undergoing PCI with DAPT, P-CABs reduced UGI bleeding comparably to PPIs. These findings suggest that P-CABs are potential alternatives to PPIs for preventing UGI bleeding.",,,

This study aims to determine the barriers/facilitators to PDAC genetics care/surveillance among Black and Latino/a populations. This is a concurrent mixed-methods study that utilized electronic surveys and semi-structured focus groups/in-depth interviews (02/14/2022-12/21/2022). This was a volunteer sample of Black or Latino/a general participants with a personal or family history of PDAC and community leaders serving these groups. Participants discussed barriers/facilitators to PDAC cancer genetics care/surveillance. Health literacy, cancer worry, medical trust, and inherited cancer risk were assessed using electronic surveys. Discussions were recorded, transcribed, and analyzed using a content analysis approach. Chi-square tests, two-sample t-tests, and one-way analysis of variance were used to evaluate survey data using R v4.3.2. 55 participants (n = 27 general participants, 28 leaders) completed surveys. 27 (49%) self-identified as Black and 23 (42%) as Latino/a. Leaders (74%) reported higher levels of perceived medical mistrust among their communities than general participants (Trust in Physician Scale mean/SD 29.9/4.2 vs. 38.4/5.2, p < 0.001; Medical Mistrust Index = 18.8/4.2 vs. 24.4/3.6; p < 0.001, respectively). General participants self-reported higher digital health seeking capabilities than leaders' perception of that skillset (p < 0.001). 24 of these participants completed a focus group/in-depth interview, emphasizing informed discussions with a trusted/established provider. Individuals impacted by PDAC are open to genetics care and desire resources to promote PDAC surveillance.

A cost-utility analysis consisting of a decision tree and Markov cohort designed to calculate the difference in costs and health outcomes between two scenarios: (1) disease-modifying treatment (DMT) for SMA after diagnosis through NBS, and (2) DMT for SMA after diagnosis as symptoms appear. A population of 295,906 newborns was modeled, based on the total number of live births in Australia in 2023. Inputs included screening parameters, epidemiology inputs, SMA natural history data and DMT parameters (nusinersen and onasemnogene abeparvovec), costs, and health-related quality of life parameters. Assumed participation in NBS was 100%. A one-way sensitivity analysis and probabilistic sensitivity analysis were conducted to examine the impact of parameter uncertainty. There were 30 patients identified with SMA, of whom 25 patients would be eligible for presymptomatic treatment. NBS for SMA was dominant compared with no NBS for SMA. On a population level, NBS demonstrated a lifetime gain of 267 quality-adjusted life years (QALY) and incremental costs of -AUD$3,983,263 (i.e., cost savings). Every dollar invested in NBS would save hospitals $3.69. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses demonstrated the robustness of the base-case results. NBS for SMA was dominant compared with no NBS for SMA in Australia from a state and territory payer perspective.

Severe RIL has been associated with worse prognosis and survival, and recent studies suggested that RIL also affects immunotherapy efficacy. We aimed to develop murine grade 2 (≥20 % decrease in absolute lymphocyte counts (ALC)) RIL models and to examine the effects of RIL on progression-free survival upon radiotherapy-immunotherapy treatment. C57BL6/J mice received heart, large blood vessels (LBV) or thoracic vertebrae irradiation (10 Gy) and ALC were monitored weekly. In tumour-bearing animals, Lewis Lung Carcinoma cells were injected subcutaneously one day prior to RIL induction. When tumours reached 212 ± 45 mm Radiation treatment plans targeting lymphocyte-rich organs were optimized to achieve maximal target coverage while minimal dose to normal tissues. In naïve animals, LBV and vertebrae irradiation led to grade 2 RIL, however heart irradiation induced only grade 1 RIL. In tumour-bearing animals, RIL induction was confirmed by a 16 % and 20 % drop in ALC upon LBV and vertebrae irradiation, respectively. Grade 2 RIL did not negatively influence progression-free survival upon radiotherapy. Radiation combined with L19-IL2 induced a tumour growth delay compared to radiotherapy only (p < 0.0005). LBV or vertebrae irradiation did not affect radiotherapy-immunotherapy outcome, explained by the restored and increased lymphocyte and eosinophil counts upon L19-IL2 administration (p < 0.05). L19-IL2 increased inducible regulatory and CD8 Collectively, utilizing the developed murine RIL models, we observed that RIL did not negatively affect radiotherapy treatment outcome.

In Phase 3 trials, daridorexant significantly reduced polysomnography-determined wake after sleep onset (WASO) versus placebo, and rates of daytime somnolence were similar to placebo. This analysis examines the effect of daridorexant on WASO in each 2-h quarter (Q) of the night (8-h recording), and on next-morning sleepiness, daytime alertness and ability to function (assessed daily using visual analog scales [VAS]), and the correlation between these night and day assessments. Data from 930 patients with insomnia disorder randomized to daridorexant 50 mg (n = 310), 25 mg (n = 310) or placebo (n = 310) for 3 months were analyzed. At Month 1, daridorexant 25 mg and 50 mg significantly decreased WASO versus placebo in Q2 (least-square mean difference [LSMD] 25 mg: -4.7 min p < 0.0001; 50 mg: -7.1 min p < 0.0001), Q3 (LSMD 25 mg: -3.3 min p = 0.0086; 50 mg: -7.2 min p < 0.0001) and Q4 (LSMD 25 mg: -4.3 min p = 0.0055; 50 mg -8.5 min p < 0.0001). Results were similar at Month 3. VAS scores for next-morning sleepiness, daytime alertness and ability to function improved from Day 1 in all groups and continued to improve over time, with treatment numerically ranked as daridorexant 50 mg > 25 mg > placebo.

40288237,Quantifying temporal differences in the induction of interferon-mediated signalling observed in a dengue virus 1 human infection model: insights from longitudinal proteome analysis.,2025-05-16,EBioMedicine,10.1016/j.ebiom.2025.105728,"According to WHO, dengue is one of the top ten global health threats, with almost half of the world's population at risk of being infected. Most of the annual 400 million dengue virus (DENV) infections manifest asymptomatically or in a mild form, causing symptoms such as fever and headache. Nevertheless, every year 500,000 dengue cases require hospitalization and up to 25,000 patients die. Despite the high incidence, the DENV-elicited proteome response remains insufficiently understood. Therefore, we evaluated the proteome dynamics of nine dengue-naïve individuals experimentally infected with the underattenuated DENV-1 strain 45AZ5 via the Proximity Extension Assay technology of Olink®. Using Olink Explore, a total of ∼3000 proteins were quantified simultaneously in serum samples at 8, 10, 14, and 28 days after the viral inoculation. We identified the top ten significant proteins via linear mixed effects models, i.e., interferons (IFNs), IFN-related proteins, and members of the CCL and CXCL chemokine family. In all participants, an increase in IFN-λ1 levels was observed after peak viral load, whereas in one participant an IFN-γ response was not detected. Interestingly, both the onset and peak viral load of this participant were, on average, delayed 4 days compared to other participants. To gain a detailed kinetic overview of the DENV-elicited proteome response, we designed a smaller, targeted Olink® panel to evaluate serum protein levels at multiple time points throughout the infection. Here, we revealed that type I/III IFN response precedes the type II IFN response. In conclusion, our analyses provided detailed insights into the temporal dynamics of the different IFN responses upon a primary DENV-1 infection. These insights might aid in better understanding dengue pathogenesis.

Although the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries have relatively lower TB incidence rates, they face unique challenges, particularly with a large migrant workforce from TB-endemic regions. Understanding trends in TB burden in these countries is essential for guiding public health strategies. We analyzed TB trends in GCC countries from 1990 to 2021 using data from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study. Joinpoint regression assessed temporal trends, and ARIMA modeling was used to forecast future TB incidence, mortality, and DALYs. The metrics considered age-standardized mortality rates (ASMR), DALYs rate (ASDR), and incidence rates (ASIR). Data visualizations, including choropleth maps and trend graphs, were also created using R and MS Excel. From 1990-2021, TB incidence, mortality, and DALYs showed a steady decline across the GCC countries. The age-standardized mortality rate (ASMR) decreased by an average annual percentage change (AAPC) of -5.39 %, while the age-standardized DALYs rate (ASDR) decreased at a slightly higher rate of -5.50 %. Forecasting through 2031 predicts a continued decline: the age-standardized incidence rate (ASIR) will fall from 28.4 per 100,000 in 2022-5.4 by 2031, and mortality is expected to decline from 3.87 per 100,000 to 2.39 over the same period. DALYs are projected to decrease from 103.5 in 2022-62 by 2031. Countries like Qatar and Saudi Arabia showed significant improvements, with Qatar achieving a 95.56 % reduction in mortality. However, the UAE with a 61.18 % reduction in incidence and DALYs, showed a 26.71 % increase in mortality. TB control in GCC countries shows positive trends, reflecting successful public health interventions. However, challenges remain, particularly the high prevalence of TB among migrant populations. Continued efforts and tailored interventions are essential to sustain progress toward TB elimination.",,,akanand96@gmail.com.
40288221,Latest Advances in Perioperative care for Resectable Non-small lung cancer.,,Respiratory investigation,10.1016/j.resinv.2025.04.001,"Resectable non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has a relatively poor prognosis owing to the risk of developing local or distant metastatic recurrence, even at stage I. To overcome the high recurrence rate, perioperative therapies have been rapidly developed through the combination of existing cytotoxic chemotherapies with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) and molecular targeted therapies. These new therapeutic strategies have significantly improved the prognosis of patients with stage II-III NSCLC and have been approved for clinical use. However, new challenges have emerged in the selection of the optimal perioperative treatment in clinical practice. First, it is currently difficult to determine which perioperative treatment is superior, preoperative or postoperative. Additionally, since surgery alone is curative in some patients, the addition of anticancer agents such as ICIs raises concerns regarding toxicity, as serious side effects during preoperative treatment may lead to an inability to perform the surgery itself. Moreover, because various perioperative treatments are still being developed, treatment options for perioperative care are expected to increase soon. To summarize the increasingly complex perioperative treatment of resectable NSCLC, this review provides a comprehensive summary of the clinical efficacies of current perioperative therapies and future directions based on basic background, patient selection, ongoing trials, and enhancing immunotherapy.",,,yuko.oya.710@gmail.com.

Given CSL112's potential anti-inflammatory properties, we conducted an exploratory post hoc analysis to determine if its efficacy is influenced by baseline neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), a marker of systemic inflammation, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). The purpose of this study was to investigate the association of baseline NLR and cardiovascular events and explore whether NLR and LDL-C modify CSL112's efficacy in post-AMI patients. A total of 18,219 participants with AMI, multivessel coronary artery disease, and additional cardiovascular risk factors were randomized to 4 weekly infusions of 6 g CSL112 or placebo. The primary endpoint was a composite of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, or stroke (major adverse cardiovascular events [MACE]). Cox proportional hazards models evaluated risk by dichotomized baseline NLR (>median vs ≤median). Treatment interactions with NLR and LDL-C (≥100 vs <100 mg/dL) were assessed. Among 15,966 participants, those with baseline NLR >median (>3.3) had a significantly greater risk of MACE at 90 days (HR: 1.40; 95% CI: 1.21-1.63), persisting at 180 and 365 days. CSL112 reduced MACE at 90 days among participants with elevated NLR and LDL-C ≥100 mg/dL (HR: 0.63; 95% CI: 0.42-0.93), with sustained benefits at 180 and 365 days. Significant interactions were observed between treatment and NLR (P Baseline elevated NLR predicts MACE in post-AMI patients, and CSL112 showed an associated reduction in MACE in patients with elevated NLR and LDL-C ≥100 mg/dL.",Duffy D; Anschuetz G; Kingwell BA; Harrington RA; ,; Weill Cornell Medicine; CSL Behring; CSL Limited,charlesmichaelgibson@gmail.com.
40287365,Brain photobiomodulation: a potential treatment in Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases.,,The journal of prevention of Alzheimer's disease,10.1016/j.tjpad.2025.100185,"Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and Parkinson's Disease (PD) are common neurodegenerative diseases, characterized by the progressive loss of synapses and neurons, leading to cognitive and motor decline. Their pathophysiology includes cerebral lesions, oxidative stress, neuroinflammation as well as brain-gut axis microbiota dysbiosis. Preclinical investigations demonstrated that brain photobiomodulation (bPBM) reduces oxidative stress and inflammation, increases cerebral blood flow and enhance neurogenesis and synaptogenesis, which makes bPBM a promising treatment in AD and PD. This review focuses on the clinical application of bPBM in AD and PD. It aims to provide a scientific overview of the current clinical knowledge, review recent clinical studies findings, and describe future directions and upcoming clinical studies. So far, several clinical studies investigated bPBM therapy, at various parameters, both in patients with AD and related dementia, and PD. All demonstrate bPBM safety and bring valuable clinical information regarding efficacy, with particularly promising results in AD. However, their exploratory design and inconsistent quality lead to a low level of evidence, which currently does not support the widespread use of bPBM in clinical practice. Future clinical research should address two gaps: the need for robust double-blinded RCTs vs sham with a higher number of patients and a longer follow-up, and the need for research focusing on dosimetry to determine which bPBM parameters are optimal. The ongoing or unpublished clinical studies on bPBM should fill in this gap.",Blivet G; Touchon B; Guillemin S; Moro C,CEA-Clinatec; RCTs; REGEnLIFE SAS,blivet_guillaume@yahoo.fr.
40287074,Quality by digital design to accelerate sustainable medicines development.,,International journal of pharmaceutics,10.1016/j.ijpharm.2025.125625,"We present a shared industry-academic perspective on the principles and opportunities for Quality by Digital Design (QbDD) as a framework to accelerate medicines development and enable regulatory innovation for new medicines approvals. This approach exploits emerging capabilities in industrial digital technologies to achieve robust control strategies assuring product quality and patient safety whilst reducing development time/costs, improving research and development efficiency, embedding sustainability into new products and processes, and promoting supply chain resilience. Key QbDD drivers include the opportunity for new scientific understanding and advanced simulation and model-driven, automated experimental approaches. QbDD accelerates the identification and exploration of more robust design spaces. Opportunities to optimise multiple objectives emerge in route selection, manufacturability and sustainability whilst assuring product quality. Challenges to QbDD adoption include siloed data and information sources across development stages, gaps in predictive capabilities, and the current extensive reliance on empirical knowledge and judgement. These challenges can be addressed via QbDD workflows; model-driven experimental design to collect and structure findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable (FAIR) data; and chemistry, manufacturing and control ontologies for shareable and reusable knowledge. Additionally, improved product, process, and performance predictive tools must be developed and exploited to provide a holistic end-to-end development approach.",Cottini C; Henson M; Hidber P; Langston M; Mantanus J; Quist PO; Reynolds GK; Rowland M; Thorat AA,F.

We aimed to assess the risk and describe the characteristics of children with recurrent IPD over a 12-year period covering the introduction of the 7-valent (PCV7), followed by the 13-valent (PCV13) pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) in the national childhood immunisation programme in England. We used enhanced national surveillance data for England and included all laboratory-confirmed IPD cases in children (<15 years) during 2006/07-2017/18. We assessed the risk and rate of recurrent IPD, the serotypes responsible and the demographics, comorbidity status and prevalence, vaccination status, clinical presentation and outcomes in children with recurrent IPD compared to those with a single IPD episode. There were 5158 IPD episodes reported in 5033 children over 12 years and 2.2% (105/4814) of those surviving their first IPD had at least one recurrence. Recurrence risk decreased with increasing age and over time. During 2015/16-2017/18, five years after PCV13 replaced PCV7, IPD recurrence rate was 229.0 (95% CI 154.8-339.0) per 100,000 person-years, with all recurrent cases caused by non-PCV13 serotypes. Where serotype information was available, recurrence was due to the same serotype in 25 cases, with a shorter median (IQR) interval of 88 (57-177) days between recurrent episodes, and in 60 cases due to different serotypes, with a median (IQR) interval of 223 (125-574) days (p=0.001). Compared to healthy children (103.0; 95%CI 63.1-168.1), recurrence rate per 100,000 person-years was 10 times higher in children with any comorbidity (1061.0; 95% CI 827.2-1360.9; 62/78 [79.5%] with available information had comorbidities), and almost 30 times higher in immunosuppressed children (2788.5; 95%CI 2029.0-3832.2; 38/78 [48.7%] were immunosuppressed). The 30-day case-fatality rate after recurrent IPD was 2.9% (3/105) compared to 4.4% (219/4928; p=0.63) after single-episode IPD. Recurrent IPD is rare in children and occurs mainly in children with comorbidities, especially immunosuppression.

Understanding the clinical characteristics of drug-induced IP in Japan will facilitate accurate diagnosis of the disease. The aim of this study was to analyze and report the clinical characteristics of drug-induced IP in Japan. We analyzed the characteristics of drug-induced IP diagnosed between 2009 and 2022 in Japan. Case data were collated with the cooperation of pharmaceutical companies, as requested by the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare. We identified 285 patients with drug-induced IP diagnosed in medical institutions. The most common causative drugs identified were antineoplastic agents (56.1 %). Common subjective symptoms included dyspnea (158 patients [55.4 %]), cough (132 patients [46.3 %]), and fever (115 patients [40.4 %]). In addition, 177 patients (73.1 % of those measured) showed elevated serum KL-6, SP-D, or SP-A levels. Approximately 60 % of the patients developed IP within 90 days from the initiation of drug therapy, whereas 15 % developed the disease after >1 year. Regarding imaging findings, 249 patients (87.4 %) showed bilateral shadows. Corticosteroid therapy was administered to 222 patients (77.9 %). The treatment outcomes of drug-induced IP in Japan were favorable, with improvement observed in 273 patients (95.8 %). Dyspnea, cough, and fever after administration of a drug; elevated serum KL-6, SP-D, and SP-A levels; and bilateral shadows were identified as clinical features of drug-induced IP in Japan.

Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is a potential therapeutic option for DLB, but its efficacy and safety remain uncertain. We systematically reviewed articles on ECT for DLB, including those published in Japanese-language journals, and surveyed institutions certified by the Japanese Psychogeriatric Society. Of 41 peer-reviewed articles, 32 were from Japan. The proportion of prodromal DLB cases was significantly higher in Japan (34.8 %) than in other countries (9.5 %) (p = 0.044). Cardiac [123I]-metaiodobenzylguanidine scintigraphy and/or striatal dopamine transporter imaging were significantly more frequently in Japan (71.8 %) than in other countries (5.5 %) (p < 0.001). ECT has shown effectiveness in treating depression, catatonia, agitation and psychosis. It was generally considered safe, with transient delirium being the most common side effect, occurring in 16.1 % of Japanese cases. However, current evidence is limited to case studies and lacks randomized controlled trials. The survey confirmed that ECT is widely performed for DLB in Japan, although the number of cases treated varied greatly across institutions. These findings underscore the need for standardized ECT guidelines for DLB. Multicenter studies with standardized assessments and longitudinal follow-up are essential to further research on ECT for DLB, including psychiatric-onset prodromal DLB.",,,fujishiro17@hotmail.co.jp.

Enzymatic hydrolysis is particularly noteworthy because of its mild conditions and its efficacy in producing peptides with various biological activities. This study focused on creating whey protein hydrolysates using three enzymes: pepsin, trypsin, and papain. The degree of hydrolysis and the antioxidant properties of the resulting peptides were evaluated, and papain demonstrated the highest degree of hydrolysis, leading to its selection for further investigation. LC-MS was employed to identify peptide sequences from the papain-derived hydrolysate, resulting in the identification of 107 distinct peptide sequences These peptides were predicted to exhibit a range of potential biological activities, including antihypertensive, antidiabetic, antioxidant, antimicrobial, and immunomodulatory effects, as well as roles in regulating glucose homeostasis, maintaining cardiovascular health, and supporting overall metabolic function. In vitro tests revealed the significant antioxidant and antibacterial properties of the hydrolysate, confirming the potential of papain-derived peptides for use in functional food and pharmaceutical applications.

However, it is unclear which neurophysiological processes contribute to impairments in implementing various strategies to down-regulate negative emotion. The current study used electroencephalography (EEG) to determine whether individuals at CHR have difficulty implementing reappraisal and distraction. Participants included individuals at CHR (n = 25) and healthy controls (CN: n = 36) who completed an EEG task while unpleasant or neutral stimuli were presented and they were required to either passively view or down-regulate negative emotion using reappraisal or distraction. The late positive potential (LPP) event related potential component was calculated from the EEG data and used as an objective neurophysiological indicator of emotion regulation effectiveness. CN effectively decreased the amplitude of the LPP for both reappraisal and distraction compared with unpleasant passive viewing; however, CHR did not differ in LPP amplitude for unpleasant passive viewing, reappraisal, and distraction, suggesting an implementation abnormality. Difficulty implementing distraction was associated with greater severity of attenuated positive symptoms. Collectively, these findings suggest that CHR display neurophysiological patterns of emotion regulation impairment that are similar to those that have been identified among individuals with schizophrenia in past studies. Interventions have been developed to target these mechanisms. It may be beneficial to apply these interventions to psychosis-spectrum populations where they would have relevance for both treatment of established symptoms and prevention of illness among those at CHR.",,,gstrauss@uga.edu.

As a glucocorticoid, BUD prevents the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines/chemokines and the recruitment of immune cells into the inflamed mucosa. However, emerging evidence indicates that BUD, unlike classical glucocorticoids, is also a potent modulator of stem and cancer cell behavior/plasticity. Certainly, BUD stabilizes cell-cell adhesions, preventing embryonic stem cell differentiation and inhibiting the development of 3D gastruloids. In addition, BUD inhibits the motile/invasive propensity of different cancer cells, including breast, lung, and pancreatic cancer. Finally, it prevents the infection of positive single-stranded human-infecting RNA viruses such as SARS-CoV-2. At a molecular level, BUD induces epigenetic changes and modifies the transcriptome of epithelial, stem, and cancer cells, providing molecular support to the immune cell-independent activity of BUD. Here, we performed an in-depth review of these unexpected activities of BUD, identified by unbiased drug screening programs, and we emphasize the molecular mechanisms modulated by this efficacious drug that deserve further research.",,,

This study explores enhancing membrane protein production in these cells by deleting the C-terminal of the ATF6B gene using CRISPR-Cas9 technology. The objective of this research is to investigate the effect of C-terminal deletion of the ATF6B gene on membrane protein production in HEK293T cells using CRISPR-Cas9 technology. To identify effective gene targets, sgRNAs were initially designed against multiple UPR-related genes, including ATF6A, IRE1A, IRE1B, PERK, and ATF6B. Among them, ATF6B was selected as the primary target for further investigation due to its superior editing efficiency. The efficiency of sgRNAs was evaluated using the T7E1 assay, and sequencing was performed to verify gene editing patterns. Membrane proteins were extracted from both ATF6B C-terminally deleted (ATF6B-ΔC) and wild-type (WT) cell lines for comparison. Flow cytometry was employed to assess membrane protein production by analyzing GFP expression in Membrane-GFP-expressing cells. HEK293T cells with C-terminally deleted ATF6B (ATF6B-ΔC) significantly increased membrane protein production by approximately 40 ± 17.6% compared to WT cells (",Kim BR,Translational Research Team,
40281717,In Vitro-In Silico Approach in the Development of Clopidogrel Solid Dispersion Formulations.,,"Bioengineering (Basel, Switzerland)",10.3390/bioengineering12040357,"The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of solid dispersion (SD) formulation factors on improvement of the bioavailability and pharmacokinetic profile of clopidogrel after peroral administration using an in vitro-in silico approach. A clopidogrel-specific, physiologically based biopharmaceutical model (PBBM) was developed and validated to predict absorption and distribution of clopidogrel after peroral administration of the tested formulations. Clopidogrel solid dispersions were prepared using two polymers (poloxamer 407 and copovidone) and a drug-to-polymer ratio of 1:5 and 1:9. The results of the in vitro dissolution test under pH-media change conditions showed that the type and ratio of polymers notably influenced the release of clopidogrel from the SDs. It can be observed that an increase in the polymer content in the SDs leads to a decrease in the release of clopidogrel from the SDs. The predictive power of the constructed clopidogrel-specific PBBM was demonstrated by comparing the simulation results with pharmacokinetic data from the literature. The in vitro dissolution data were used as inputs for the PBBM to predict the pharmacokinetic profiles of clopidogrel after the peroral administration of SDs. SDs with copovidone (1:5) and poloxamer (1:9) showed the potential to achieve the highest drug absorption and bioavailability, with an improvement of over 100% compared to an immediate-release (IR) tablet. The sample with poloxamer (1:9) may have the potential to reduce inter-individual variability in clopidogrel pharmacokinetics due to absorption in the cecum and colon and associated lower first-pass metabolism in the liver. This suggests that distal intestine may be the targeted delivery site for clopidogrel, leading to improved absorption and bioavailability of the drug. This study has shown that an in vitro-in silico approach could be a useful tool for the development and optimization of clopidogrel formulations, helping in decision making regarding the composition of the formulation to achieve the desired pharmacokinetic profile.",,,
40281504,Qualitative analysis and exploration of anti-inflammatory and antibacterial effects of a Thai traditional medicine formula from Wat Pho beyond its use for COVID-19 treatment.,2025-04-26,BMC complementary medicine and therapies,10.1186/s12906-025-04873-3,"Ya-Kao (YK) is a traditional Thai medicine used to relieve fever and consists of 14 crude drugs. It has been recommended by Thai folk healers and the Department of Thai Traditional and Alternative Medicine for COVID-19 treatment, with clinical studies conducted to assess its efficacy. However, scientific evidence on its biological properties remains limited. This study aims to explore the quality aspect of YK and evaluate its antibacterial and anti-inflammatory effects. The quality aspect of the YK formula was assessed using high-performance thin-layer chromatography (HPTLC). Agar disc diffusion and TLC bioautography were used for antibacterial activity, while anti-inflammatory effects were evaluated by measuring nitric oxide (NO) production in LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 macrophages. The HPTLC method, utilizing a developing system of toluene, ethyl acetate, and formic acid (70:30:1, v/v/v), was successfully developed for the authentication of YK crude drugs. This method provides the most distinct fingerprint pattern of the components within the YK formulation, enabling clear visualization of its constituent. Additionally, it enables preliminary identification of phenolics, terpenes, and steroids, providing valuable insight into the formulation's chemical composition. The antibacterial activity of YK was evaluated using the disk diffusion assay, and it was found that the lime juice extract of the YK formula (LYK) exhibited the largest zone of inhibition against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial strains, particularly those pathogenic to the respiratory tract. Additionally, the antibacterial activity was evaluated using TLC bioautography, and the results indicated that the methanolic extract of YK (MYK) exhibited an inhibition zone against Streptococcus pyogenes and Klebsiella pneumoniae. It was found that several compounds displayed an inhibition zone. Furthermore, the YK extract with methanol, water, and lime juice exhibited significant anti-inflammatory properties by suppressing NO accumulation in LPS-stimulated macrophage cells (p < 0.05). This study is the first to standardize YK raw materials using HPTLC and evaluate the biological properties of each crude drug and the combined formula. The developed HPTLC method ensures accurate identification of YK raw materials, preventing the use of incorrect ingredients. Additionally, the pharmacological findings confirm YK's anti-inflammatory and antibacterial activities, particularly against respiratory pathogens linked to COVID-19.",Sanookpan K,Nabsolute Company Limited,sornkanok.v@pharm.chula.ac.th.

The control of its dosage in conventional release tablets requires the analytical validation of its method to ensure accurate quantification and provide confidence in the reliability of the results for informed decision-making. This study aims to validate an innovative method for Azithromycin quantification using the accuracy profile. Additionally, a comparison is made between the uncertainty measurements calculated from the validation data using two formulas proposed by Feinberg et al. and Saffaj & Ihssane and contrasted with the ISO GUM approach. A liquid chromatography system intended for Azithromycin analysis equipped with a reversed-phase C18 stationary phase consisting of octadecyl silyl vinyl polymer in a UV detector operating at 210 nm at a temperature of 40 °C in isocratic elution using a mobile phase of acetonitrile and dipotassium hydrogen phosphate buffer (6.7 g/L), in the fraction of (60:40, v/v) at pH = 8. The various accuracy profiles are illustrated to ensure that a known quantity of anticipated findings acquired through the method stand inside the tolerance interval of 95% and remain within the previously set acceptance limits of ± 5%. Measurement uncertainty provides comparable values using both formulas of the total error approach. However, it was observed that the ISO-GUM approach tends to overestimate the expanded uncertainty. Specifically, while the ISO-GUM approach provides a rigorous framework, the use of the validation data offers a more empirical uncertainty estimation. The approach based on the total error grants the ability to accurately close the routine uncertainty, emphasizing a complete validation. The proposed method is robust for pharmaceutical application, demonstrating good accuracy, with 95% of tolerance and uncertainty limits falling within the predefined acceptance limits of ± 5%.",Bamou NI,Dioma Pharmaceutical Manufacturing Company,

We investigated whether validated scales measuring apathy severity capture the three dimensions of the DCA-NCD (diminished initiative, diminished interest, diminished emotional expression). Degree of mapping (""not at all"", ""weakly"", or ""strongly"") between items on two commonly used apathy scales, the Neuropsychiatric Inventory-Clinician (NPI-C) apathy and Apathy Evaluation Scale (AES), with the DCA-NCD overall and its 3 dimensions was evaluated by survey. Survey participants, either experts (n = 12, DCA-NCD authors) or scientific community members (n = 19), rated mapping for each item and mean scores were calculated. Interrater reliability between expert and scientific community members was assessed using Cohen's kappa. According to experts, 9 of 11 (81.8%) NPI-C apathy items and 6 of 18 (33.3%) AES items mapped strongly onto the DCA-NCD overall. For the scientific community group, 10 of 11 (90.9%) NPI-C apathy items and 7 of 18 (38.8%) AES items mapped strongly onto the DCA-NCD overall. The overall mean mapping scores were higher for the NPI-C apathy compared to the AES for both expert (t (11) = 3.13, p = .01) and scientific community (t (17) = 3.77, p = .002) groups. There was moderate agreement between the two groups on overall mapping for the NPI-C apathy (kappa= 0.74 (0.57, 1.00)) and AES (kappa= 0.63 (0.35, 1.00)).

We used the 2016-2019 U.S. Nationwide Readmissions Database (NRD) to examine the association between RA diagnosis and 90-day readmission and in-hospital mortality risk during the 90-day readmission after index HF hospitalization. We performed multivariable-adjusted logistic regression, adjusting for patient demographics, Deyo-Charlson comorbidity index, median household income for patient's ZIP code, primary expected payer, patient state residency status, teaching status of hospital, hospital control, and hospital bed size. We calculated adjusted odds ratios (aOR) and 95 % confidence intervals (95 % CI).

Advances in MRI and genetic diagnostics now allow most patients to receive a genetic diagnosis, and emerging treatments are shifting the field from therapeutic nihilism to cautious optimism. Allogenic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), used since the 1980s, has shown efficacy in specific leukodystrophies, such as adrenoleukodystrophy and metachromatic leukodystrophy, when administered early. Gene therapy has become a viable option, with ex vivo approaches like atidarsagene autotemcel providing promising outcomes for early-onset MLD. Trials for gene replacement and antisense oligonucleotide therapies are ongoing for several leukodystrophies, including Canavan disease and Alexander disease. Certain treatments, such as guanabenz for Vanishing White Matter, target disease-specific dysregulated molecular pathways. Despite these advances, challenges remain, including the ultrarare nature of most leukodystrophies, limited natural history data, high treatment costs, and barriers to accessibility. Future developments, including newborn screening and close international collaboration, aim to enhance early diagnosis, refine treatment timing, and expand access to innovative therapies.",,,n.wolf@amsterdamumc.nl.
40279576,The Role of Digital Opinion Leaders in Dengue Prevention Through Health Promotion and Public Health Collaboration: Qualitative Semistructured Interview Study.,2025-04-26,Journal of medical Internet research,10.2196/70997,"Dengue fever is a significant public health concern. The advent of social media has introduced digital opinion leaders (DOLs), health care professionals with substantial online followings who play a pivotal role in disseminating health information and combating misinformation. We aimed to investigate the role of DOLs in dengue prevention and explore their preferences for collaboration with health sector entities to strengthen dengue prevention initiatives. A qualitative study was conducted using semistructured interviews with 37 purposively selected DOLs from 8 countries in Latin America and Southeast Asia. They were selected based on their active online presence, dissemination of dengue-related content, and substantial social media followings. Interviews took place either in person or online, according to the participants' chosen languages. Each session, lasting approximately 60 minutes, was audio recorded, transcribed verbatim, and subjected to thematic analysis to identify recurring themes. The thematic analysis led to several key findings. First, DOLs used social media to enhance public health communication, focusing on raising awareness (16/37, 43%), correcting misconceptions (17/37, 46%), and modeling preventive behaviors (8/37, 22%) for infectious diseases. They educated audiences on disease symptoms and prevention, addressed vaccine hesitancy, and shared personal practices to encourage similar actions among followers. Second, 35% (13/37) of the DOLs reported a widespread lack of public knowledge about dengue and its prevention, with even less awareness of vaccine availability. In addition, 27% (10/37) of them identified challenges due to antivaccination sentiments and misinformation, while 8% (3/37) noted obstacles from perceived inadequate government leadership in dengue prevention. In response, DOLs leveraged their social media influence to educate the public. A significant number (22/37, 59%) of the DOLs emphasized the importance of regular promotion of vector control measures as the cornerstone of dengue prevention and 68% (25/37) highlighted the critical role of vaccines, particularly among vulnerable groups. Finally, collaboration was essential for expanding DOLs' reach and credibility, with 54% (20/37) of them partnering with pharmaceutical companies, 43% (16/37) with government agencies, and 27% (10/37) with nongovernmental organizations. In these collaborations, 38% (14/37) of the DOLs emphasized the importance of adhering to ethical standards, and 57% (21/37) prioritized projects aligning with their personal values and professional standards, avoiding producing content that contradicted their beliefs or goals. DOLs are essential in disseminating dengue prevention information. They recognize their responsibility to raise awareness about dengue vaccines and dispel related misconceptions to combat vaccine hesitancy. Unlike nonmedical social media influencers, whose content may lack medical accuracy and be driven by monetization, DOLs provide evidence-based information, enhancing their credibility. Collaborations between DOLs and health sector stakeholders, although currently limited, hold significant potential for effective dengue prevention, provided they adhere to ethical standards and are supported by credible scientific evidence.",Green A; Wu S; Di Pasquale A,Regional Medical Affairs Vaccines; IQVIA Real World Solutions Asia-Pacific,

Treatment guidance for topical therapy (the mainstay of AD management), with particular consideration of emerging treatments, may further improve patient care. Here, we aim to provide healthcare professionals with AD treatment recommendations from the perspective of 10 Canadian dermatologists with expertise in managing AD. The panel of dermatologists conducted a systematic literature review and leveraged their clinical experience to develop generally accepted principles, consensus statements, and a treatment algorithm using an iterative consensus process. The panel collectively developed six generally accepted principles, 10 consensus statements, and a treatment algorithm. The guidance notes that assessment of disease severity should encompass both physician-rated measures and patient-reported outcomes. Disease education, lifestyle-based strategies (e.g., trigger avoidance), and supportive measures (e.g., moisturizers) can help reduce signs and symptoms of AD. Choice of therapy should consider disease-, patient-, and treatment-related factors. Although topical corticosteroids (TCS) are often used as first-line treatment in AD, they should be limited to intermittent short-term use. Noncorticosteroid topical therapies (e.g., topical calcineurin inhibitors; topical phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitors; and topical Janus kinase inhibitors) can be used for widespread involvement of AD according to approved use. Once treatment goals are achieved, noncorticosteroid topical maintenance therapy should continue to prevent flares and reduce the need for TCS. Guidance reflecting the benefits and limitations of topical AD treatments in conjunction with patient understanding of treatment goals supports robust shared decision-making in the management of AD.",Gooderham MJ; Papp KA; Ringuet J; Turchin I,Probity Medical Research; Centre de Recherche Dermatologique du Québec Métropolitain; SKiN Centre for Dermatology,mgooderham@centrefordermatology.com.

Recent research indicates that RSV may be underdiagnosed, especially in adult populations. This study aims to investigate the burden of RSV in hospitalized adults. A retrospective, matched-control cohort study covering the seasons 2011/2012 to 2021/2022 was performed on the basis of anonymized claims data from 6 million individuals in multiple German statutory health funds. Analyses comprise hospitalized persons aged 18+ years. Patients with RSV were identified using the International Classification of Diseases, tenth revision, German Modification (ICD-10-GM) codes directly related to RSV (narrow approach) and indirectly related to RSV (ICD-10-GM codes covering lower respiratory tract infections, broad approach). Comparing these cohorts can provide a reasonable estimate of upper and lower bounds. For patients with a secondary inpatient diagnosis of RSV, we evaluated mortality rates, lengths of stay (LOS), costs, special fees, intensive care unit (ICU) admission rates, ventilation rates, and use of high-flow oxygen. Cohorts were matched with controls using an 1:1 exact matching approach using age, sex, Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI, excluding age), main inpatient diagnosis, and quarter/year of admission. Mortality rates were between 15.5 (standard deviation, SD 1.031) and 19.8 (SD 0.070) times higher for patients with secondary inpatient diagnosis of RSV compared with their controls. Average LOS was 1.77 (SD 0.007) times longer than in controls, and healthcare costs were between 5600 EUR (SD 132.81) and 8400 EUR (SD 2313.54) higher for patients with RSV. No significant differences were found between patients with RSV and controls with respect to rehospitalization rate, invasive ventilation rate, or high-flow oxygen rate; however, patients indirectly related to RSV were admitted more often to intensive care (10.54% versus 3.25%). Our study provides a deeper understanding of how RSV secondary diagnosis affects hospitalized patients, finding that RSV infection dramatically increases mortality rate, LOS, and inpatient healthcare costs.

Equivalent efficacy and comparable safety of GP2015 to reference etanercept (ref-ETN) was demonstrated in two phase III studies, one in patients with moderate-to-severe chronic plaque-type psoriasis (PsO; EGALITY study) and the other in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA; EQUIRA study). EGALITY also included patients with reported psoriatic arthritis (PsA). Here, patient-reported outcome (PRO) data from both studies are presented. EGALITY included 531 patients with PsO and EQUIRA included 376 patients with RA. In EGALITY, patients who had achieved ≥ 50% improvement in Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) at week 12 either continued the initial treatment or underwent three treatment switches between GP2015 and ref-ETN starting at week 12.

This retrospective study focused on patients treated with complex-free (incobotulinumtoxinA) and complex-containing (onabotulinumtoxinA and abobotulinumtoxinA) BoNT/A formulations over an up to 10-year period. The novel dose-effect parameter ""DEff"" was introduced to quantify the relationship between dose adjustments and clinical outcomes, enabling the identification of partial treatment failures. The primary endpoint was a comparison of a clinically meaningful worsening in DEff in treatment year 7 compared to year 2 between complex-free and complex-containing botulinum neurotoxin type A. The RELY-CD study provides unique insights into long-term treatment patterns, clinical resistance phenomena, and the implications of formulation differences on treatment outcomes, addressing a critical gap in the literature on real-world botulinum neurotoxin type A application.

Evaluating MSL performance is critical for demonstrating their value, yet defining appropriate key performance indicators (KPIs) remains challenging due to the combination of scientific engagement, relationship-building, and other activities that are difficult to measure. This study examines the current and perceived ideal use of quantitative and qualitative metrics for MSL performance evaluation, the difficulties in measuring MSL impact, and the perceived effectiveness of existing KPIs. A global survey of 1023 medical affairs professionals across 63 countries was conducted, gathering data on which KPIs are currently used versus which should be used, the preferred weighting of qualitative vs. quantitative metrics, and opinions on measurement difficulty and KPI effectiveness. The results reveal a strong preference for qualitative metrics (52%) over quantitative metrics (7%), though most organizations primarily use activity-based metrics such as the number of key opinion leader (KOL) engagements (92%). Despite these practices, many respondents believe that MSL KPIs should focus more on impact-based qualitative metrics, such as the quality of KOL/HCP relationships and/or engagements (70%) and the quality of actionable insights gathered (67%). Furthermore, 67% of participants reported it is ""difficult"" or ""very difficult"" to measure MSL performance accurately, and only 3% revealed current KPIs and metrics used to measure MSL performance are ""very effective"". These findings highlight a disconnect between the way MSLs are evaluated and the value they provide. This study demonstrates the need for a balanced KPI framework that integrates both qualitative and quantitative measures. A more refined performance evaluation system (incorporating stakeholder feedback, insight quality, and strategic impact) can ensure fair assessments and drive MSL effectiveness.",Dyer S; Hyder C; Kraemer J,Syneos Health; Medical Science Liaison Society,

Recurrent or metastatic ACC has very limited therapeutic options. Cyclin-dependent kinase 9 (CDK9) is a key factor in the oncogenic transcriptional regulatory network, and inhibition of CDK9 may prove beneficial in MYC-dependent tumors such as ACC. A first-in-human, phase I, two-part dose-escalation and -expansion clinical trial (NCT04718675) enrolled patients with advanced solid tumors reliant on transcription factor activation to receive KB-0742, an oral selective inhibitor of CDK9. The primary endpoint was to establish safety/tolerability while nominating a recommended phase II dose (RP2D). Secondary endpoints included characterization of pharmacokinetics and assessment of preliminary efficacy. Among 19 patients with ACC enrolled in dose expansion at the RP2D (60 mg orally 3 days on and 4 days off each week during a 28-day cycle), the regimen was well tolerated with mild gastrointestinal toxicity and fatigue; a single grade 3 treatment-related adverse event was observed (elevated γ-glutamyl transferase). One patient discontinued for gastrointestinal toxicity. Although no responses were observed, nine of 16 (56%) eligible patients had stable disease, with four experiencing >6 months of stability. Six-month progression-free survival was 37% (95% confidence interval, 14.2-59.8). Most patients had the more indolent type II ACC phenotype and 10 (53%) had MYB alterations. This dose-expansion cohort exploring the novel CDK9 inhibitor KB-0742 in patients with advanced ACC established favorable tolerability at the RP2D. Disease stabilization was observed in some patients despite a limited efficacy signal. A first-in-human, phase I trial explored the safety and preliminary efficacy of the CDK9 inhibitor KB-0742 in patients with advanced, transcription factor-dependent solid tumors including ACC.

Training itself enhances insulin sensitivity in horses, similar to the improvements in performance capacity observed in human athletes. This study aimed to investigate whether aleurone supplementation provides additional benefits to training by modulating insulin metabolism and gut microbiota in Standardbred mares. Sixteen Standardbred mares (aged 3-5 years) participated in a cross-over study with two 8-week training periods separated by 8 weeks of detraining. Each horse received either 200 g/day aleurone supplementation or a control diet. Insulin metabolism was evaluated using oral (OGTT) and intravenous (FSIGTT) glucose tolerance tests, measuring parameters such as Maximum Training alone: Training significantly improved OGTT parameters by decreasing Maximum Aleurone supplementation enhances training-induced improvements in glucose metabolism and fecal microbiota composition, which could offer potential benefits for equine athletes by optimizing metabolic flexibility. It also supports improvements in glucose and insulin dynamics, particularly by further enhancing insulin sensitivity and glucose-mediated disposal.

The impact of the EU HTAR on diverse national HTA frameworks was explored in a three-country case study. Recommendations were developed to leverage strengths and address weaknesses to ensure consistent and cohesive vaccine assessments. The case study revealed potential overlaps between NITAGs and the EU HTAR, particularly regarding horizon scanning and joint scientific consultations. The involvement of NITAGs in national assessments varies, influencing how well joint clinical assessment reports will ultimately align with and be applicable to individual Member States. Stronger consideration of vaccines within the EU HTAR and NITAG involvement can streamline assessments, reduce duplication, and improve alignment between European and national processes.

However, there are few commonly used suicide screeners that also identify other mental health (MH) problems. A new, electronically administered instrument, the K-CAT, screens for suicide and multiple MH problems. We hypothesized that the K-CAT would enhance suicide identification compared with routine screening and identify significant anxiety and depression in youth presenting with non-MH chief complaints. This observational study was conducted in 2 PEDs. Eligible youth were 7 to 17 accompanied by a caregiver without: severe medical concerns, difficult behaviors, limited verbal language, or only a psychiatric complaint. Of the 341 eligible, 241 (70.7%) were screened, and 228 both presented with a non-MH problem and had complete K-CAT data. A Fisher exact test determined whether suicidal behaviors/ideation rates differed between the K-CAT and retrospective chart review data. Seventy-four or 32.46% of youth scored positive for suicide, anxiety, and/or depression on the K-CAT. Females were more likely to screen positive (P<0.001). Compared with the retrospective data, more youth were identified with suicide risk by the K-CAT (3.95% vs. 0%; P=0.004). Youth identified by the K-CAT were 62.5% female and 33.3% 7 to 11 years. The K-CAT increases the identification of suicidal ideation and behaviors overall and in younger children.

A sizable number of patients do not respond to first-line treatments. Non-invasive neuromodulation is a second-line treatment approach, but current methods rely on cortical targets to indirectly modulate subcortical structures, e.g., the amygdala, implicated in MATRDs. Low-intensity transcranial focused ultrasound (tFUS) is a non-invasive technique for direct subcortical neuromodulation, but its safety, feasibility, and promise as a potential treatment is largely unknown. In a target engagement study, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-guided tFUS to the left amygdala was administered during functional MRI (tFUS/fMRI) to test for acute modulation of blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) signal in a double-blind, within-subject, sham-controlled design in patients with MATRDs (N = 29) and healthy comparison subjects (N = 23). In an unblinded treatment trial, the same patients then underwent 3-week daily (15 sessions) MRI-guided repetitive tFUS (rtFUS) to the left amygdala to examine safety, feasibility, symptom change, and change in amygdala reactivity to emotional faces. Active vs. sham tFUS/fMRI reduced, on average, left amygdala BOLD signal and produced patient-related differences in hippocampal and insular responses. rtFUS was well-tolerated with no serious adverse events. There were significant reductions on the primary outcome (Mood and Anxiety Symptom Questionnaire General Distress subscale; p = 0.001, Cohen's d = 0.77), secondary outcomes (Cohen's d of 0.43-1.50), and amygdala activation to emotional stimuli. Findings provide initial evidence of tFUS capability to modulate amygdala function, rtFUS safety and feasibility in MATRDs, and motivate double-blind randomized controlled trials to examine efficacy.ClinicalTrials.gov registration: NCT05228964.",,,gfonzo@austin.utexas.edu.

Of these symptoms, deficits in motivation and pleasure, especially in the domain of avolition, are particularly disabling. Effects of inflammation on motivational deficits in patients with depression are associated with disruptions in corticostriatal reward circuitry involving the inferior ventral striatum (iVS) and ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC). Accordingly, we examined the relationships among inflammation, negative symptoms, and corticostriatal reward circuitry in patients with schizophrenia. Negative symptoms and high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) were obtained in 57 individuals with schizophrenia.

However, metabolic reprogramming has emerged as a key driver of GB progression and invasiveness. This study presents a rare case of recurrent GB with scalp metastasis, exploring how metabolic shifts enable GB cells to evade treatment and adapt to hostile environments, offering insights for developing innovative therapies. Tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) was employed to analyze amino acid profiles in both the recurrent and metastatic stages of GB. Systems biology approaches were used to uncover genetic alterations and metabolic reprogramming associated with the progression from recurrence to metastasis. Our analysis revealed distinct amino acid utilization patterns in a patient with a molecular phenotype of wild-type IDH-1&2, TERT mutation, non-mutated BRAF and EGFR, and non-methylated MGMT. During recurrence and metastasis, significant differences in amino acid profiles were observed between blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples. Additionally, protein-protein interaction (PPI) analysis identified key genomic drivers potentially responsible for the transition from recurrent to metastatic GB. Beyond established risk factors such as craniotomy, biopsies, ventricular shunting, and radiation therapy, our findings suggest that metabolic reprogramming plays a crucial role in the transition from recurrent to metastatic GB. Targeting these metabolic shifts could provide new avenues for managing and preventing extracranial metastasis in GB, making this an important focus for future research.",Jusheghani F,Department of Biotechnology,Ahmadpourrashidi89@gmail.com.

Compared with controls, two neutrophil populations, immature neutrophils and neutrophils with type II interferon signature genes (Neu_T2ISG), are increased in patients with MPA. Trajectory and cell-cell interaction analyses identify Neu_T2ISG as a subset that differentiates from mature neutrophils upon stimulation with IFN-γ and TNF, which synergize to induce myeloperoxidase and Fcγ receptors expression on the neutrophil cell surface and promote ANCA-induced neutrophil extracellular trap formation. Case-by-case analysis indicates that patients with a high proportion of the Neu_T2ISG subset are associated with persistent vasculitis symptoms.

40274769,SOX5 inhibition overcomes PARP inhibitor resistance in BRCA-mutated breast and ovarian cancer.,2025-04-25,Cell death & disease,10.1038/s41419-025-07660-7,"Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors are effective in cells with homologous recombination (HR) deficiency, including BRCA1/2 mutation. However, PARP inhibitors remain a therapeutic challenge in breast and ovarian cancer due to inevitably acquired resistance in most cases. Therefore, strategies to overcome PARP inhibitor resistance are unmet clinical need. SRY-box transcription factor 5 (SOX5) plays a crucial role in development of various cancers but the role of SOX5 in PARP inhibitor resistance is poorly understood. This study identified SOX5 as a potential biomarker associated with PARP inhibitor resistance and addressed potential treatment strategies to overcome PARP inhibitor resistance using the olaparib-resistant preclinical model. We observed that SOX5 was significantly upregulated in olaparib-resistant cells and contributed to PARP inhibitor resistance by upregulating DNA repair pathway genes. Ectopic SOX5 overexpression contributed to PARP inhibitor resistance by suppressing DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) in BRCA-mutated breast and ovarian cancer. SOX5 small interfering RNA combined with olaparib sensitized olaparib-resistant cells and suppressed the growth of olaparib-resistant xenografts in mice via increased DSBs represented by ɣH2AX formation. Mechanistically, SOX5 directly interacted with yes-associated protein 1 (YAP1) and promoted its nuclear translocation by suppressing the Hippo pathway. YAP1, in association with TEA domain family members (TEAD), upregulated HR-related gene expression and conferred PARP inhibitor resistance. Furthermore, the clinical relevance of SOX5 as a therapeutic target was supported by a significant association between SOX5 overexpression and poor prognosis in ovarian cancer on public mRNA microarray data sets. Therefore, we propose SOX5 as a promising therapeutic target for overcoming PARP inhibitor resistance in BRCA1/2-mutated breast and ovarian cancer.",,,ymoon@cha.ac.kr.

Clinical endocrinology & metabolism,10.1016/j.beem.2025.101999,"After diagnosis of craniopharyngioma, patients frequently develop a rapid weight gain leading to morbid hypothalamic obesity due to disease- and/or treatment-associated hypothalamic lesions. Hypothalamic obesity should be diagnosed and treated in the context of hypothalamic syndrome. Hypothalamic syndrome includes neuroendocrine deficiencies, disruption of circadian rhythm, disturbed hunger-satiety and thirst feelings, temperature dysregulation, and neurocognitive, sleep and psychosocial behavioral problems. Long-term prognosis is frequently impaired by increased risk for metabolic syndrome, cardiovascular problems, severe impairments of health-related quality of life, and premature mortality. Treatment of hypothalamic syndrome is challenging. Recently, an algorithm for personalized, risk-specific treatment of hypothalamic syndrome has been published. Dextro-amphetamines and other central stimulating agents as well as glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R) agonists may cause weight loss. Bariatric surgery is effective. However, non-reversible procedures are controversial due to ethical and legal considerations in minors.

However, obtaining FDM pharma-ink (drug-loaded filaments) of consistent diameter may be challenging and time consuming by hot melt extrusion. Additionally, to implement non-destructive quality control methods for 3DP tablets requires producing tablets containing varying levels of active pharmaceutical ingredient for model calibration. Some of these levels may not be possible to manufacture due to impaired formulation processability. Here, vacuum compression moulding (VCM) melt-processing was deployed for assessing two aims for 3DP of personalised oral tablets. First, as a novel small-scale production method for dimensionally accurate pharma-ink, and second, accomplishing non-destructive dose verification in 3DP tablets with a model derived from VCM object samples acting as 3DP tablet surrogates. Tablets containing 10, 20, and 30 mg tamoxifen, a drug currently being progressed in 3DP clinical trials, were accurately printed with the developed pharma-ink, with mass and drug content variations within European and U.S. pharmacopoeia specifications. Release profiles were equal between tablet sizes. For the first time, the feasibility of cylindrical VCM objects as tablet surrogates was demonstrated for non-destructive near-infrared (NIR) dose determination in 3DP tablets.

These delays are largely attributed to complex health technology assessments, extended price negotiations and protracted provincial listing decisions. To address these challenges, in November 2023, Canada's Drug Agency (CDA) introduced its first early access program - the time-limited reimbursement recommendation (TLR) - aimed at accelerating the reimbursement of promising drugs undergoing Health Canada's Notice of Compliance with Conditions (NOC/c) process. In conjunction, the pan-Canadian Pharmaceutical Alliance developed the Temporary Access Process (pTAP) to support price negotiations for drugs that go through CDA's TLR pathway. AbbVie corporation was the first company to participate in the TLR and pTAP processes with EPKINLY (epcoritamab) - a novel treatment for advanced lymphoma. On 18 June 2024, EPKINLY became the first therapy in Canada to receive a positive CDA TLR recommendation and on 19 July 2024, AbbVie and the pan-Canadian Pharmaceutical Alliance successfully concluded pTAP negotiations. As of 1 November 2024, EPKINLY was listed in nine provinces, achieving a 10.7 month faster time-to-patient than the average time for the standard process, which is significant and meaningful to patients. This achievement demonstrates the potential of the TLR and pTAP processes to improve medicine access timelines for patients. However, an analysis of drugs that received NOC/c status from Health Canada between 2020 and 2024 reveals that very few drugs would have met the current strict eligibility criteria required to benefit from the TLR, limiting the potential benefits of these programs. While TLR and pTAP are promising initiatives, refinements are needed to maximize their impact and ensure faster access to life-saving therapies for Canadian patients.",Balijepalli C; Gullapalli L; Prasad S; Roc NP; Rusu A; Price N; Dempster W; Barakat S,3Sixty Public Affairs; AbbVie Corporation; AbbVie Pty Ltd; Pharmalytics Group,

The present study examined the association between CVD and (i) seasonality of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D) and (ii) individual 25(OH)D concentrations. Harmonized 25(OH)D data were obtained from the Biomarkers for Cardiovascular Risk Assessment in Europe (BiomarCaRE) project, including 79,570 participants examined between 1984 and 2010. One 25(OH)D measurement was available per participant. Primary endpoints were CVD incidence (coronary heart disease or stroke; n = 6006) and CVD mortality (n = 2985). To study (i), Poisson regression-derived rate ratios were compared according to two-month categories, ordered by baseline 25(OH)D concentrations. To study (ii), Cox regression-derived hazard ratios were compared according to quarters of baseline 25(OH)D concentrations. With respect to (i), despite a median 25(OH)D concentration ratio of 1:1.79, the trough months of 25(OH)D in March and April had a similar CVD incidence as the peak months of 25(OH)D in August and September (rate ratio: 1.07, 95% CI: 0.98-1.17). CVD mortality was slightly higher in the trough months compared to the peak months (rate ratio: 1.27, 95% CI: 1.12-1.44) but not compared to the other months (despite median 25[OH]D concentration ratios up to 1:1.62; p ≥ 0.077). The CVD mortality peak in January preceded the 25(OH)D trough, not adhering to the temporality criterion of Bradford Hill. With respect to (ii), compared to the lowest quarter, the highest quarter of 25(OH)D was associated with lower CVD incidence (hazard ratio: 0.82, 95% CI: 0.76-0.89) and CVD mortality (hazard ratio: 0.64, 95% CI: 0.57-0.72). The present study does not support the hypothesis that seasonal increases in CVD are driven by short-term reductions in 25(OH)D.

A cross-sectional study was conducted through a retrospective review of electronic medical records from onsite clinics at a South Korean semiconductor company. The study focused on employees who visited the onsite clinics between 2013 and 2016 due to the risk of chronic diseases including hypertension, diabetes, and dyslipidemia. Descriptive statistics assessed clinic utilization and adherence, while multivariable logistic regression identified influencing factors, adjusted for age, sex, work type, work shift, workplace, specific onsite clinic, diagnosis, and disease duration. Out of the 39,073 employees examined, 8,837 sought care at onsite clinics for managing chronic disease risks. The majority of these participants were male (88.2%) and predominantly aged in their 30s and 40s (84.6%). Among these individuals, 33.0% visited the clinics five or more times, and 28.5% filled prescriptions on two or more occasions. Chronic diseases were the second most common reason for onsite clinic visits. The average adherence to prescription as measured by the Proportion of Days Covered (PDC) was 0.61, with 40% of individuals showing a high adherence. Notably, older age and employment at workplaces located outside metropolitan areas were significant factors positively associated with both the utilization of onsite clinic services and adherence to prescribed treatments. This study found that onsite clinics within a semiconductor company were actively utilized for managing chronic diseases, particularly among older employees and those in workplaces located in areas where medical access is limited compared to metropolitan areas. These findings highlight the potential role of onsite clinics in enhancing chronic disease management. Future research across a broader range of workplaces could further support and expand these insights.",,,

It is crucial for the pharmaceutical industry to be clear of the reporting and case management requirements for such issues. The Health Sciences Authority of Singapore used a mixed-methods evaluation strategy, combining an online questionnaire and face-to-face focus group discussions to identify areas for knowledge enhancement and challenges faced by the industry regarding product defect reporting and recall procedures. These findings were used to plan training workshops. A self-administered online survey was emailed to representatives of all pharmaceutical companies with registered medicines and/or vaccines, or cell, tissue and gene therapy products (CTGTPs) in Singapore. The aim was to find out the challenges faced with product defect reporting and recall procedures. Two face-to-face focus group discussions were conducted with selected companies, specifically those that conducted product recalls between September 2022 and August 2024. A two-day online industry training workshop was held in October 2024. Pre- and post-workshop quizzes, including self-rating questions, were conducted to quantify the participants' baseline knowledge and what they gained from the workshop. In total, 136 out of 463 individuals (29.4%) completed the online survey questionnaire for medicines and vaccines, while 24 out of 42 individuals (57.1%) completed the survey for CTGTPs. Seventeen industry professionals were invited for two focus group discussions. Participants provided feedback on existing processes, and requested clearer guidelines and examples on reportable defects, to aid their internal decision-making. The training workshop saw 318 and 271 industry professionals in attendance over two days, respectively, with 160 participating in both pre- and post-workshop quizzes. There was an improvement in average quiz scores ranging from 4.5% to 25.0% post-workshop. Participants' self-ratings also improved from a median of 3 (out of 5) to median of 4 from pre- to post-workshop. The series of evaluations revealed an enhanced understanding of regulatory requirements in industry professionals through a combination of surveys, focus group discussions and tailored training workshops. These initiatives can equip the industry with knowledge to make informed decisions and enhance overall compliance with product defect reporting and recall procedures.

Ruzasvir, a small-molecule NS5A inhibitor, has demonstrated improved anti-HCV activity compared with first-generation NS5A inhibitors. Clinical studies have demonstrated favorable efficacy and safety of bemnifosbuvir and ruzasvir in combination with other NS5A and NS5B inhibitors, respectively. A Phase 1 study in healthy participants was conducted to assess the drug-drug interaction potential between bemnifosbuvir and ruzasvir, as well as food effects following coadministration of both compounds. Under fasted conditions, the peak, trough, and total exposure to bemnifosbuvir and its metabolites were increased upon coadministration with ruzasvir (by a maximum of 33% vs bemnifosbuvir alone), whereas the corresponding values for ruzasvir were decreased upon coadministration with bemnifosbuvir (by a maximum of 26% vs ruzasvir alone). Food delayed peak exposure to both drugs (by up to 2 hours) while increasing their peak and total exposure by up to 63%. No serious adverse events or premature drug discontinuations were reported.

Patients and clinicians were blinded to the index and alerts. Participants were followed for 12 months for site reporting of events. A total of 2,155 patients were enrolled at 103 sites and were monitored remotely (39% implantable cardioverter-defibrillators and 61% cardiac resynchronization therapy-defibrillators). There were 243 hospitalizations for HF, of which 156 (64%) were index hospitalizations. There were 25 (28%) unplanned all-cause readmissions in the 30 days after discharge and 45 (46%) all-cause readmissions within 90 days. Alert sensitivity for outpatient visits and hospitalizations for HF was 78.3%, and the false-positive rate was 1.18/year. The HeartLogic index was higher before index hospitalizations for HF when followed by HF or readmission for all causes. Index hospitalizations for HF were also more likely to be followed by readmission for HF in 90 days if the patient was in an alert state (vs out-of-alert state) 1 or 2 weeks before or 2 weeks after the index admission. HeartLogic index trends were significantly different for patients who were readmitted for HF.

An important supporter of this research has been the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK), most recently through the Accelerating Medicines Partnership Program for Type 2 Diabetes (AMP T2D) and Accelerating Medicines Partnership Program for Common Metabolic Diseases (AMP CMD). These public-private partnerships of the National Institutes of Health, multiple biopharmaceutical and life sciences companies, and nonprofit organizations, facilitated and managed by the Foundation for the National Institutes of Health, were designed to improve understanding of therapeutically relevant biological pathways for type 2 diabetes. On the occasion of NIDDK's 75th anniversary, we review the history of NIDDK support for these partnerships, which saw the convergence of research directions prioritized by academic consortia, the pharmaceutical industry, and government funders. Although the NIDDK was not the sole originator or funder of these efforts, its support and leadership have been pivotal to the partnerships' success and have enabled their research to be broadly accessible through the AMP Common Metabolic Diseases Knowledge Portal (CMDKP) and the AMP Common Metabolic Diseases Genome Atlas (CMDGA). Findings from AMP CMD align with NIDDK's mission to conduct research and share results with the goal of improving health and quality of life.

Once diagnosed, treatment is generally limited to intravenous thrombolysis (IVT), endovascular thrombectomy, or both. Intravenous thrombolysis has theoretical benefits (enhancing reperfusion, dissolving smaller thrombi) and harms (delaying time to endovascular intervention, allergic reaction, increased bleeding risk). To assess the effects of endovascular thrombectomy with IVT versus without IVT on functional independence (defined as a modified Rankin Scale score (mRS) < 3) within 90 days in people with acute ischaemic stroke. We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, Scopus, LILACS, Google Scholar, the International HTA database, and two trial registries to November 2023. We included randomised controlled trials of adults with acute ischaemic stroke who received endovascular therapy and were randomised to either intravenous thrombolysis within 4.5 hours or a control. Outcomes were: functional independence (mRS score < 3), excellent functional outcome (mRS score < 2), mortality, asymptomatic intracranial haemorrhage, symptomatic intracranial haemorrhage, successful revascularisation (thrombolysis in cerebral infarction (TICI) grades 2b to 3), and complete revascularisation (TICI grade 3 only), within 90 days. We used the Cochrane RoB 2 tool to assess the following potential sources of bias for each outcome: bias arising from the randomisation process; bias due to deviations from intended interventions; bias due to missing outcome data; bias in measurement of the outcome; and bias in selection of the reported result. We pooled outcome data using the random-effects model and performed meta-analyses using the Mantel-Haenszel method. We assessed the statistical heterogeneity of pooled data by visually inspecting forest plots to consider the direction and magnitude of effects, and used the Chi We included six studies, with a total of 2336 participants (1166 control and 1170 intervention).

Limitations included: differences in inclusion and exclusion criteria between studies (e.g. age thresholds, pre-existing comorbidities or baseline functional status, time periods, diagnostic imaging, specific vessels); specific endovascular device used; thrombolysis medication and dose; and potential conflict of interest, as multiple study authors reported receiving funding or fees from pharmaceutical companies. For functional independence, assessed as an mRS score < 3 within 90 days, we downgraded the certainty of evidence by one level due to a high I The evidence does not currently support a clear benefit or harm for routine intravenous thrombolysis amongst people receiving endovascular thrombectomy. Amongst participants receiving endovascular thrombectomy, IVT did not demonstrate evidence of a difference in functional independence, excellent functional outcome, mortality, and asymptomatic intracranial haemorrhage, or symptomatic intracranial haemorrhage, when compared with no IVT. However, IVT did result in a higher rate of successful and complete revascularisation when compared with no IVT. Future research should include more high-quality trials to further evaluate the role of intravenous thrombolysis in people receiving endovascular thrombectomy to provide more robust data and further narrow the confidence intervals. Future research should also identify whether time- and person-specific factors influence the effect of IVT amongst those receiving endovascular thrombectomy.

In this study, we examined the usefulness of esophageal SEMS placement as a palliative treatment and evaluated the prognostic factors. Patients who underwent esophageal SEMS placement at three regional base hospitals from December 2007 to June 2023 were included in the study. Of 73 patients, 57 patients who underwent palliative SEMS placement were evaluated after excluding 16 patients in whom postoperative treatment was possible after SEMS placement. Median survival after SEMS placement was 67 days (mean, 96 ± 16 days). Univariate analysis identified age (≤78 years vs. >78 years), performance status (3 or 4 vs. 1 or 2), the cancer location (other sites vs. gastrointestinal cancer), the resumption of oral intake (failure vs. success), and clinical stage (IVA/IVB vs. III) as prognostic factors after SEMS placement. On multivariate analysis, performance status 3 or 4 (odds ratio [OR] = 2.87, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.28-6.45), cancers other than gastrointestinal cancer (OR = 3.75, 95% CI = 1.14-12.3), and failure to resume oral intake (OR = 21.3, 95% CI = 3.40-133.0) were significantly associated with poor prognosis.

The WHO Disability Assessment Schedule (WHODAS) 2.0 and the EuroQol 5-Dimensions 5-Level (EQ-5D-5L) are recommended to assess disability and health-related quality of life (HrQoL), respectively. As they may measure partially overlapping constructs, we assessed their relationship. We conducted a secondary analysis of the multicenter cluster-randomized controlled Enhanced Recovery after Intensive Care (ERIC) trial (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT03671447). At follow-ups scheduled 6 months after ICU discharge, critical illness survivors and caregivers completed the EQ-5D-5L, the patient-reported and the proxy-reported 12-item WHODAS 2.0. We employed local polynomial regressions, correlation coefficients, and linear regressions to analyze the global and domain-specific relationships between the EQ-5D-5L and the WHODAS 2.0. We analyzed 700 patients with a median EQ-5D-5L index value of 0.81 [IQR 0.52 to 0.94], a median patient-reported WHODAS 2.0 sum score of 11 [IQR 3 to 23], and a median proxy-reported WHODAS 2.0 sum score of 16 [IQR 6 to 28]. The EQ-5D-5L index value highly correlated with patient-reported (Spearman: - 0.84 [95% CI - 0.86 to - 0.82]) and proxy-reported (Spearman: - 0.70 [- 0.76 to - 0.64]) WHODAS 2.0 sum scores. Corresponding domains were also highly correlated, with the patient-reported WHODAS 2.0 aligning more closely with the EQ-5D-5L than the proxy-reported WHODAS 2.0. We found ceiling and floor effects for both instruments, indicating limitations for detecting mild disabilities and high HrQoL. In multivariable linear regressions, the patient-reported and proxy-reported WHODAS 2.0 sum scores (both - 0.02 [95% CI - 0.02 to - 0.02], p < 0.01) and WHODAS 2.0 domain scores for mobility, self-care, and life activities were predictors of the EQ-5D-5L index value and respective EQ-5D-5L domain scores. Our results suggest a high correlation between the patient-reported and proxy-reported WHODAS 2.0 and the EQ-5D-5L, particularly in their corresponding domains. To economize post-ICU assessments, there may be no need to use both instruments simultaneously.",Ribet Buse E; Grunow JJ; Spies CD; Weiss B; Paul N,Department of Anesthesiology and Intensive Care Medicine (CCM/CVK),nicolas.paul@charite.de.
40270013,Qualitative changes in clinical records after implementation of pharmacist-led antimicrobial stewardship program: a text mining analysis.,,Journal of pharmaceutical health care and sciences,10.1186/s40780-025-00439-0,"Antimicrobial stewardship programs (ASPs) are essential for optimizing antimicrobial use, but many medium-sized hospitals lack infectious disease (ID) specialists. Ward pharmacists can contribute to ASPs, but the qualitative changes in their practice patterns after ASP implementation remains unclear. We aimed to explore the potential of text mining as a novel methodology to evaluate changes in ward pharmacist antimicrobial management practices after ASP implementation in a medium-sized hospital without ID physicians. We conducted a retrospective observational analysis of data documented in clinical records by ward pharmacists in a 313-bed community hospital from April 2014 to March 2022. The ASP team conducted weekly reviews of targeted patients, provided feedback to physicians, and shared recommendations with ward pharmacists who then collaborated to optimize antimicrobial therapy. Using Python-based text mining with standardized technical terms and compound word extraction, we performed morphological analysis, co-occurrence network analysis, and hierarchical clustering to evaluate documentation patterns before and after ASP implementation in April 2018. Co-occurrence relationships were assessed using Dice coefficients (threshold, ≥ 0.3), and communities were detected using the Louvain algorithm. Changes in documentation patterns were compared using Fisher's exact test. The analysis included 1,353 pre-ASP and 5,155 post-ASP clinical records containing antimicrobial-related terms, which increased from 3.12 to 7.81% of the total pharmacy records. New strong co-occurrence relationships emerged in the post-ASP period for several laboratory parameters (c-reactive protein, 0.646; estimated glomerular filtration rate, 0.594; and white blood cell count, 0.582). Network analysis revealed a shift from medication-focused communities (Medication Review, Prescription Verification, and Patient Education) to infection-focused communities (Infection Assessment, Microbiological Review, and Severe Infection Management). Although Antimicrobial Management was consistently used in both periods (odds ratio [OR]: 0.70, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.38-1.20), cross-tabulation analysis increased significantly in Laboratory Monitoring (OR: 1.58, 95% CI: 1.39-1.78) and Infection Assessment (OR: 2.09, 95% CI: 1.85-2.36). This pilot application of text mining demonstrated potential as a novel methodology for objectively evaluating qualitative changes in clinical practice patterns following ASP implementation, successfully identifying shifts in pharmacists' documentation focus and providing a foundation for future multi-center validation studies across diverse healthcare settings.",,,y-muraki@mb.kyoto-phu.ac.jp.

The methodology involved searching the original PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus for studies published between January 1975 and March 2025. The search was completed on 13 March 2025. Studies describing exercise therapy for liver cirrhosis patients were selected. Relevant information matching the study objectives, such as intervention duration, content, intensity setting, evaluation criteria, and outcomes, was extracted and documented. Of the 2314 articles identified, 18 fit the inclusion and exclusion criteria, with a total of 950 participants. The most prevalent form of exercise therapy was a combined aerobic exercise and strength training program (55.6%). Commonly used assessment criteria included the 6-minute walking distance for endurance evaluation (44.4%) and the Chronic Liver Disease Questionnaire for quality of life assessment (33.3%). Intervention durations ranged from 30 to 60 min per day, 2 to 7 days per week, and 8 to 12 weeks. Concerning intensity setting, subjective fatigue levels and heart rate were frequently used (38.9%), though detailed descriptions were limited. For the establishment of effective exercise therapy for patients with liver cirrhosis, future research should concentrate on tailoring intensity settings according to individual patient needs.

Here we discover that RNA-binding proteins and glycosylated RNAs (glycoRNAs) form precisely organized nanodomains on cancer cell surfaces. We characterize nucleophosmin (NPM1) as an abundant cell surface protein (csNPM1) on a variety of tumor types. With a focus on AML, we observe csNPM1 on blasts and leukemic stem cells but not on normal hematopoietic stem cells. We develop a monoclonal antibody to target csNPM1, which exhibits robust anti-tumor activity in multiple syngeneic and xenograft models of AML, including patient-derived xenografts, without observable toxicity. We find that csNPM1 is expressed in a mutation-agnostic manner on primary AML cells and may therefore offer a general strategy for detecting and treating AML. Surface profiling and in vivo work also demonstrate csNPM1 as a target on solid tumors. Our data suggest that csNPM1 and its neighboring glycoRNA-cell surface RNA-binding protein (csRBP) clusters may serve as an alternative antigen class for therapeutic targeting or cell identification.",,,ryan.flynn@childrens.harvard.edu.

Organs on chips offer a promising alternative, but widespread use of polydimethylsiloxane introduces challenges due to its sorption of small lipophilic molecules, distorting pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data. Cyclic olefin copolymer, a chemically stable alternative with minimal sorption, has emerged as a potential solution. This study investigates the sorption behavior of seven pharmaceutically active compounds in microfluidic devices and washout of these compounds, using high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry to evaluate recovery of compounds. Lipophilic molecules exhibited substantial sorption in polydimethylsiloxane and lower retention in cyclic olefin copolymer. Imipramine (logP = 4.80) decreased from 100 µM to 0.0384 µM for polydimethylsiloxane and 31.5 µM for cyclic olefin copolymer after 24 h incubation. Sorption was governed by multiple factors - lipophilicity and rotatable bond count were critical for both materials, hydrogen bond acceptors and molecular weight played a larger role in cyclic olefin copolymer, whereas topological polar surface area was critical for polydimethylsiloxane. Washout studies revealed that polydimethylsiloxane retains lipophilic compounds through bulk absorption, causing slow release, while cyclic olefin copolymer facilitated easier desorption. The cumulative sum of the first 5 h washout of loperamide (logP = 5.13) is 37.8% for polydimethylsiloxane and 71.5% for cyclic olefin copolymer. These findings highlight the importance of material selection and molecular properties in minimizing sorption and ensuring reliable experimental outcomes especially in microfluidic systems with distinctly different surface to volume ratios to other models.",Grindulis K; Rimsa R; Mozolevskis G,Cellbox Labs,roberts.rimsa@cellboxlabs.com.

In Europe most available antibiotics have been licensed in the past through so-called national procedures, meaning that antibiotic labels (e.g., therapeutic indications, posology, contra-indications) may vary across European member states. As a result, antibiotics are prescribed in the EU with different directions of use. This study aims to evaluate whether on streamlining the product information of antibiotics in the period 2007-2020 has been sufficiently implemented. Specifically, it examines whether member states and pharmaceutical companies have fulfilled their obligation to update the therapeutic indication sections of the amoxicillin containing medicines label according to the outcomes of the referral. We performed a follow-up of the previous study measuring five years after the referral's conclusion and decision whether and how complete the indication sections of the product information for one of 15 antibiotics that underwent referral procedures during the previous study period (2007-2020) were updated. We have chosen amoxicillin as case example for this study as it is the most frequently used antibiotic in the primary care setting, and the referral took place mid-term 2007-2020,-with a conclusion in 2015. In total we could identify 806 medicinal products with an active pharmaceutical ingredient amoxicillin available in 2015 across 30 EEA countries and the UK. We found that in 22 % (176 out of 806) amoxicillin products still included therapeutic indications that should have been removed from the SmPC following the 2015 referral procedure. The most frequent therapeutic indications that were incorrectly still listed in the indication sections of the product information were endocarditis treatment (oral formulation) in 55 % (97 out of 176 products), followed by lower respiratory tract infections 49 % (87 out of 176 products), and upper respiratory tract infections 46 % (81 out of 176 products). Inconsistencies in therapeutic indications continue to pose challenges, potentially impacting the safe and effective use of antibiotics. Such discrepancies can lead to misuse or inappropriate prescribing of crucial antibiotics, contributing to the growing problem of antimicrobial resistance. Our study highlights the importance of following up on and verifying the implementation of finalized regulatory procedures at EU level. Further research is needed to understand the root causes of incomplete implementations, possibly also due to incomplete updates of the EMA Article 57 database.",Kwa M,Department of Pharmacovigilance,opalska.ab@gmail.com.

The paratuberculosis antibodies from 4488 dairy cow sera were detected by an ELISA kit, complemented by a comprehensive analysis of milk production parameters, health metrics, reproductive indices, and pharmaceutical expenditures (2021-2024). The results indicated that the paratuberculosis prevalence in the dairy farm gradually reduced from 6.76% (2021) to 3.58% (2024). It was also found that the paratuberculosis prevalence among dairy cows increased progressively with the increase in parity until the fifth calving, after which a significant decline was observed. The reduction in infection rates in the herd was correlated with measurable improvements in milk quality metrics, including elevated milk fat and protein content, extended shelf stability, and decreased somatic cell counts in milk. In addition, the reproductive performance of the dairy cows relatively improved with the decrease in paratuberculosis prevalence; there was a relative improvement in the reproductive performance of the dairy cows, which mainly occurred by the time of pregnancy at the first service of the cows, while the number of monthly occurrences of endometritis, diarrhea, calving intervals, and inseminations decreased.

Within patients with and without LAA, outcomes were compared between subgroups based on age, NIHSS score (for ischemic stroke patients), ABCD Among 1920 analyzed patients (of 2278 enrolled), 452 had LAA. Unlike RCTs, 21.2% of patients with LAA had NIHSS > 5, and 48.2% received DAPT > 30 days. Patients with LAA had higher bleeding rates (3.5% vs. 2.1%, p = 0.004), primarily hemorrhagic infarctions and moderate bleeding, than those without LAA. However, primary effectiveness outcomes were similar (4.9% vs. 3.5%, p = 0.201) between the groups. In patients with LAA, prolonged DAPT (> 21 days), multiple MRI lesions, age ≥ 65, and loading doses increased bleeding risk. The real-world DAPT use in patients with LAA exceeds RCTs boundaries with possible drawbacks on treatment safety.",Guarino M; Barone V; Zedde M; Grisendi I; Petruzzellis M; Mezzapesa DM; Di Viesti P; Inchingolo V; Cappellari M; Zenorini M; Candelaresi P; Andreone V; Cavallini A; Moraru S; Terruso V; Mannino M; Frisullo G; Muscia F; Tassi R; Paci C; Diamanti S; Tarletti R; Caputi L; Invernizzi P; Pelliccioni G; Bonanni L; Tonon A; Anticoli S; Sanna A; Del Sette M; ,; Stroke Unit; UOC Neurologia; Neuroscienze; Departiment of Neurology; Urgency and Emergency Department; Department of Neurology; UO Neurologia D'urgenza e Stroke Unit; Dipartimento di Medicina e Scienze Dell'Invecchiamento; Department of Cardiocerebrovascular Diseases; IRCCS Istituto Delle Scienze Neurologiche di Bologna; Department of Neuroscience; Neurology Unit,

It is unclear whether this increased risk is present even in patients with minor ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) receiving dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT). This study aimed to evaluate the impact of cancer on the short-term outcomes after DAPT in patients with non-cardioembolic minor ischemic stroke or high-risk TIA. This was a secondary analysis of the prospective multicentric READAPT study (NCT05476081), including patients with non-cardioembolic minor ischemic stroke (NIHSS ⩽ 5) or high-risk TIA (ABCD2 ⩾4) who initiated DAPT within 48 h of symptom onset. The primary effectiveness outcome was the 90-day risk of new ischemic stroke or other vascular events (TIA, myocardial infarction, death due to vascular causes). Secondary outcomes included 90-day mRS score distribution and all-cause mortality. The primary safety outcome was the 90-day risk of any bleeding, with secondary safety outcomes including 24-h hemorrhagic transformation. We used Inverse Probability Weighting to compare outcomes between patients with and without cancer. From 2278 patients in the READAPT study cohort, we included 1561 patients (mean age 70.3 ± 11.7 years; 65.4% males), of whom 206 (13.2%) had cancer, categorized as either active (27.7%) or in remission (72.3%). After weighting, overall cancer patients had a higher risk of 90-day new ischemic stroke or other vascular events (weighted HR 1.78, 95% CI 1.20-2.63,  Patients with minor ischemic stroke or high-risk TIA and active cancer have increased risk of ischemic and bleeding events after DAPT.

40265410,"A Novel Method for Preparing Uniform Micro-Sized Dry Powder Formulations, Including Aggregation-Controlled VHH.",,"Antibodies (Basel, Switzerland)",10.3390/antib14020029,"The preparation of antibodies in powder form without changing their physicochemical properties may enable their use in new drug delivery system therapies or non-refrigerated storage. The variable domain of heavy-chain antibodies (VHHs) is more suited for this purpose than that of conventional antibodies because of VHHs' high thermal stability and ability to refold. In this report, the fine droplet drying (FDD) process was selected as the powderization technique because of its favorable features, such as mild drying conditions and the generation of uniform particle sizes. The aggregation, binding, particle, and in vitro inhalation properties of the prepared VHH powders (VHHps) were evaluated. The amount of aggregated VHHs present in the VHHps depended on the flow temperature during the FDD process, with higher temperatures yielding a higher aggregation ratio. In contrast, no significant difference in binding activity was observed between each VHHp preparation and the native VHHs. However, this process degraded VHHs or inactivated their function, and ultimately, only about 30% of the original VHHs were functional, whereas the remaining VHHs that were not degraded showed little loss of functionality, even after storage at room temperature for more than two years. Analysis of the VHHp samples revealed that the particles were uniformly spherical with a single-micron size. The VHHps showed fine inhalation properties in the inhalation property test. These findings suggest that the FDD process affords various VHH powder formulations, including pharmaceutical formulations.",Moritani T; Masaki H; Yonehara R; Suzuki T; Arai H; Tsuchiya M; Nemoto N,RICOH Company; Epsilon Molecular Engineering Inc.,

Current guidelines recommend the use of immunosuppressants; however, the optimal type and dosage of these agents remain unclear. Herein, we report a case of steroid-refractory immune-related pneumonitis that was successfully treated with mycophenolate mofetil (MMF). The patient did not respond to high-dose steroid therapy as initial treatment but showed significant improvement in both subjective symptoms and imaging findings after the additional administration of MMF. Subsequent tapering of the MMF dose led to worsening imaging findings, which improved upon re-escalation of the MMF dose. This case highlights the potential efficacy of MMF for the treatment of steroid-refractory immune-related pneumonitis and provides valuable insights into the administration of MMF and its potential role in managing similar cases.",,,

Whole-genome sequencing revealed that L. brevis QD-1 lacks virulence factors and biogenic amine synthesis genes, confirming its safety for food and pharmaceutical applications. Genome annotation identified β-glucosidase from glycoside hydrolase families (GH1, GH2, GH3, and GH30), suggesting its potential role in ginsenoside biotransformation. In vitro study demonstrated that L. brevis QD-1 might proliferate in Ngoc Linh ginseng extract and express β-glucosidase after 24 h of fermentation. Fermentation significantly altered the ginsenoside profile, notably increasing the rare saponin majonoside R2 from 479.65 mg/L to 649.32 mg/L after 48 h. Additionally, fermentation enhanced total phenolic content and facilitated the release of essential and non-essential amino acids, particularly threonine, valine, lysine, and histidine, which were initially undetectable in the raw extract. These compositional changes correlated with improved pharmacological properties, as the fermented extract exhibited significantly stronger antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and DNA-protective activities compared to the raw extract. These findings highlight the potential of L. brevis QD-1 as a safe and effective microbial agent for enhancing the bioactivity of Ngoc Linh ginseng, paving the way for its applications in functional foods and natural therapeutics.",Ngo-Thi NH; Truong-Thi HT; Luong TK,VINACROP Company Limited; VINAPANAX Company,daduy@ntt.edu.vn.

The liver is the principal organ affected, though other organs, such as the lungs, may also be involved to a lesser extent. The condition is characterised by obstruction of the hepatic venules, leading to sinusoidal congestion, hepatic ischaemia and, in severe cases, fulminant liver failure. Recent refined diagnostic criteria, published by the European Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation in 2023, provide a more accurate method of detecting SOS/VOD, allowing earlier intervention and better stratification of patients according to the severity of their disease.

This disparity is driven by the complex biological diversity of these malignancies. RCRC and LCRC differ not only in clinical presentation and outcomes but also in their underlying molecular and genetic profiles. This article offers a detailed literature review focusing on the distinctions between RCRC and LCRC. We explore key differences across embryology, anatomy, pathology, omics, and the tumor microenvironment (TME), providing insights into how these factors contribute to prognosis and therapeutic responses. Furthermore, we examine the therapeutic implications of these differences, considering whether the conventional classification of CRC into right- and left-sided forms should be refined. Recent molecular findings suggest that this binary classification may overlook critical biological complexities. Therefore, we propose that future approaches should integrate molecular insights to better guide personalized treatments, especially anti-EGFR therapies, and improve patient outcomes.",,,a.seeber@i-med.ac.at.

This study examined mortality trends related to AMI and T2DM among U.S. adults aged ≥25 years from 1999 to 2022. Using the CDC WONDER database, we analyzed death certificates where AMI (ICD-10: I21, I22) and T2DM (ICD-10: E11) were listed as underlying or contributing causes. Age-adjusted mortality rates (AAMRs) per 100,000 population and annual percent change (APC) were calculated and stratified by year, sex, race/ethnicity, and region. Between 1999 and 2022, 196,326 deaths were recorded. AAMRs increased from 3.35 in 1999 to 3.66 in 2003 (APC: 2.39; 95 % CI, -0.69-8.71; p = 0.14), declined to 3.08 in 2014 (APC: -1.75∗; 95 % CI, -4.66 to -0.51; p = 0.05), then significantly rose to 4.64 in 2022 (APC: 6.19∗; 95 % CI, 4.89-7.78; p = 0.002). Men had consistently higher AAMRs than women, rising from 4.30 vs. 2.67 in 1999 to 6.42 vs. 3.18 in 2022. Hispanics had the highest AAMR, followed by non-Hispanic (NH) Black, NH Other, and NH White populations. Regionally, the highest mortality rates were observed in West Virginia and non-metropolitan areas.

Regional analyses included sales data from eight US census divisions. We reported total unit sales and market share by brand, nationally and by region. Data on whether products had FDA marketing authorisation were obtained from FDA's Searchable Tobacco Product Database. Nationally, Vuse, JUUL and NJOY comprised the majority of e-cigarette market share in 2022 (68.3%), 2023 (65.4%) and 2024 (57.5%), and Geek Bar emerged as the third top selling brand in 2024 (17.8%). Aside from these brands, there was a large variation in the top five brands by region across years. Approximately 13.8% of e-cigarette product sales in 2024 were authorised for sale by the FDA, as compared with 3.3% in 2023. The differences in top brands by region reflect challenges in the surveillance of e-cigarette sales, marketing and use and reflect the rapidly changing disposable e-cigarette marketplace, in which new brands are introduced and popularised at high frequency, as manufacturers of disposable e-cigarettes adapt to exploit regulatory loopholes. In the context of other emerging markets, like nicotine pouches, we urge regulators to act quickly to regulate the market for these products.",,,og96@sph.rutgers.edu.

We invented a traction band-assisted endoscopic closure (TBEC) technique using clips with an integrated traction band. We aimed to evaluate the feasibility of TBEC for closing mucosal defects following colorectal ESD.This multicenter prospective single-arm pilot study was conducted at three institutions from June 2022 to March 2023. A total of 34 patients with colorectal neoplasms measuring 20-50 mm scheduled for ESD were enrolled. TBEC was performed at each mucosal defect after ESD. The primary outcome was the complete closure rate by TBEC.

The objective of this study is to develop artificial neural network (ANN) models to predict the individual probability for NSRT. Pre-randomization data from a failed antidepressant trial were considered as potential predictors of the NSRT probability (prob-NSRT) using the response endpoint in subjects randomized to placebo. The inverse of the individual prob-NSRT (NSRT propensity score) was used as a weight in the mixed-effects model applied to assess treatment effect (TE). The comparison of the results obtained with and without the NSRT propensity score indicated that the weighted analyses provided an estimate of TE significantly larger than the conventional analyses. The propensity score weighted (PSW) analysis, adjusting for inter-individual variability in prob-NSRT, enhanced signal detection of TE. These findings support the potential role of PSW methodology for analyzing RCTs and determining TE. However, external validation of these ANN models in at least one independent trial is needed before advocating regulatory or broader clinical use.",Manfredi PL; Pappagallo M; Gomeni R,MGGM Therapeutics; PharmacoMetrica,cguidetti@mgh.harvard.edu.

The aim of this study was to characterize demographic and clinical characteristics of patients with and without AD and estimate crude incidence rates (IRs) and adjusted hazard rate ratios (HRRs) of select disease events in these cohorts. This retrospective observational analysis used Optum® Market Clarity Electronic Health Records, a US administrative healthcare database. Adults with and without AD between 2016 and 2021 with ≥ 12 months of database activity prior to index date (based on diagnosis or first treatment) were included. Each patient with AD was matched on age and index date with five patients without AD. The AD cohort was stratified by treatment prescribed within 30 days of AD diagnosis: no AD treatment; topical corticosteroids (TCS)/topical calcineurin inhibitors (TCI) only (""TCS/TCI only""); phototherapy with/without TCS/TCI (""phototherapy""); and systemic therapy, including oral corticosteroids with/without phototherapy and with/without TCS/TCI (""systemics""). Crude IRs and adjusted HRRs of infections, malignancies, cardiovascular events, mental health outcomes, asthma, fracture, and death across patient subgroups were estimated. The total cohort comprised 161,646 adults. Among the 25,915 patients with AD, 8384 (32.35%), 13,459 (51.94%), 366 (1.41%), and 3706 (14.30%) were included in the ""no AD treatment,"" ""TCS/TCI only,"" ""phototherapy,"" and ""systemics"" subgroups, respectively.

In the absence of head-to-head data, indirect treatment comparisons (ITCs) become indispensable in meeting the numerous population, intervention, comparators and outcomes (PICO) criteria to support decision-making. This study examined ITCs in European Network for Health Technology Assessment (EUnetHTA) relative effectiveness assessments (REAs) to obtain valuable insights into their potential implications for future JCAs. The EUnetHTA website was hand-searched for REAs of pharmaceutical products between 2010 and 2021. Information on PICO, ITC methods, ITC limitations/critiques, and relative effectiveness conclusions were systematically extracted. On the basis of the final EUnetHTA critiques, suitability of ITC evidence was categorised by the current study authors as appropriate, unsuitable or unclear. Twenty-three REAs were identified. Twelve REAs included an ITC, of which six were in oncology indications. Across the REAs, 64 comparisons were required, with a median of four comparators per REA (range 1-18). In total, 25 comparisons were informed by indirect evidence; the suitability of ITCs was categorised as unclear in all but one of the 25 comparisons. Multiple analyses and ITCs were necessary to address multiple PICOs. Although most ITCs were categorised as unclear within the REAs, they were still considered appropriate to inform decision-making. The EU JCA process will most likely require health technology developers to use various ITC approaches to address the multiple PICOs requested, recognising the inherent limitations of these methodologies. Efforts to address potential challenges for EU JCA should focus on supporting JCA assessors/co-assessors and national HTA agencies in the evaluation and interpretation of ITCs to enable decision-making.",van Beekhuizen S; Che M; Monfort L; Hashim M; Azough A; Kubitz N; Griffin A; Price M,Janssen-Cilag GmbH; Janssen EMEA; Johnson & Johnson; Janssen Pharmaceutica NV; Cytel,Sophie.VanBeekhuizen@cytel.com.

The first-line screening methods for breast cancer, such as mammography and tomosynthesis, are x-ray-based modalities. Unfortunately, their cancer detection rates are low in patients with dense breasts. These, and other high-risk women, are now encouraged to receive supplemental screening. The supplemental imaging methods are diverse, including ultrasound, MRI, nuclear imaging, and X-ray-based modalities such as breast CT and contrast-enhanced mammography/tomosynthesis. Due to their low cost and wide availability, x-ray-based modalities see significant clinical use worldwide. These techniques benefit from the use of contrast agents, which are currently iodinated small molecules designed for other purposes. Consequently, developing new contrast agents that are specifically for breast cancer screening is of interest. This review describes these modalities and the nanoparticle-based contrast agents being researched for their enhanced performance. The relevant parameters for nanoparticle-based contrast agent design are evaluated, including contrast generation and potential biointeractions. Iodinated agents are discussed for comparison. Nanoparticles covered include silver sulfide, silver telluride, gold, and bismuth sulfide-based agents, among others. Finally, perspectives on future developments in this field are offered.",,,

The creation and structured interrogation of aggregated datasets inform the hypothesis that ctDNA is reasonably likely to predict treatment benefit. Friends of Cancer Research convened a diverse working group to establish and implement an analysis plan assessing patient-level associations between changes in ctDNA levels with OS and progression-free survival (PFS). The aggregate dataset included eight clinical trials representing 940 patients with biomarker-positive advanced non-small cell lung cancer treated with tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Detection of baseline and on-treatment ctDNA was assessed for associations with OS and PFS. Additionally, combinations of ctDNA detection and RECIST measurements up to 10 weeks on treatment were considered. Patients with detected ctDNA at baseline that became nondetected on treatment (""clearance"") experienced improved OS compared with patients with persistently detected ctDNA (adjusted HR = 2.12, P < 0.001). This pattern was also seen in the subset of patients with stable disease as measured by RECIST within 10 weeks of treatment initiation (adjusted HR = 4.15, P < 0.001). Results were similar for PFS. In patients with oncogene-driven advanced non-small cell lung cancer treated with tyrosine kinase inhibitors, ctDNA clearance within 10 weeks of treatment initiation was associated with improved OS and PFS.

These treatments are usually given in chemotherapy day units in hospitals as same-day treatments. However, less complex anti-cancer therapy regimens may be administered in the participant's home. To assess the safety, patient preference for, and cost of IV (including subcutaneous) anti-cancer therapy (chemotherapy or immunotherapy) delivered at home as an alternative to the same IV anti-cancer therapy regimen delivered in a hospital or community setting in adults with cancer. We searched CENTRAL, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, NHS Economic Evaluation Database, Cost-Effectiveness Analysis Registry and trial registries (ClinicalTrials.gov and WHO-ICTRP) from inception until 16 October 2024. We also searched PDQ Evidence and Epistemonikos for related systematic reviews. We screened reference lists of included studies and relevant systematic reviews. We included randomised parallel and cross-over trials, conducted in adults (aged 18 years and over) diagnosed with any type and stage of cancer requiring IV anti-cancer chemotherapy or immunotherapy. Eligible studies compared delivery of IV anti-cancer therapy at home with delivery of the same therapy in a hospital setting (as an inpatient or outpatient), or in the community setting (e.g. GP practice, community clinic). We included economic evaluation studies (i.e. cost-effectiveness analyses, cost-utility analyses, cost-benefit analyses) conducted alongside eligible effectiveness studies. Primary outcomes were adverse events, hospital inpatient admission and additional hospital attendance (e.g. emergency department visit) within 48 hours of administration of anti-cancer therapy, IV line complications, participant preference, and cost of delivering IV anti-cancer therapy from a healthcare system perspective. Two review authors selected studies for inclusion, extracted trial characteristics and numerical data, assessed risk of bias, and judged the certainty of evidence using the GRADE approach. The main comparison was delivery of IV anti-cancer therapy at home versus in a hospital outpatient clinic. The primary time points of interest for outcomes related to serious adverse events, complications and cost were those collected at the longest follow-up postintervention. For outcomes such as participant preference, participant quality of life, participant and caregiver satisfaction, and non-adherence to the treatment regimen, data collected at time points as soon as possible after the intervention were of primary interest. We identified seven eligible trials (three parallel RCTs, four randomised cross-over trials; 401 randomised participants, with 272 participants included in the final analyses) and five ongoing trials. Five included trials were performed prior to the 2000s and two were performed between 2007 and 2011. Trial participants' mean age ranged from 60 to 70 years. Four trials recruited a mix of cancer patients, including breast, colon, rectum, pancreatic, pancreaticobiliary, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, lung, and head and neck cancer. Three trials focused on specific cancers (i.e. colorectal cancer, breast cancer, colon cancer). Seven trials compared delivery of IV anti-cancer therapy at home versus in a hospital outpatient clinic. One trial compared delivery of IV anti-cancer therapy in the participant's home, in the hospital outpatient clinic, and in local general practice surgery. All participants were assessed either by a physician or trained chemotherapy nurse prior to receiving each treatment cycle, and trained chemotherapy nurses administered the therapy, as per standard clinical practice, in all settings in all trials. We judged three trials as having low overall risk of bias. In four trials, the overall risk of bias was unclear due to poorly reported study methods, failing to report assessed data points and inaccessible study protocols. Due to the very low certainty of the evidence, we are uncertain of the effect of delivering IV anti-cancer therapy at home versus in the hospital outpatient clinic on the response to and management of adverse events, on both hospital inpatient admission and additional hospital attendance within 48 hours of administration of anti-cancer therapy, and on IV line complications (including infection and thrombosis). Based on low-certainty evidence, participants receiving therapy at home may be more likely to prefer future treatments at home, after receiving treatment in this setting (35 more per 100, 10 to 70 more; data from 1 RCT with 65 participants). Based on low-certainty evidence, delivering IV anti-cancer therapy at home may make little or no difference to the cost of the treatment from the healthcare system perspective in comparison to delivering it in the hospital outpatient clinic (mean cost (in 2022 Australian dollars (AUD)) per treatment at home: 126 AUD less; 1798 AUD less to 1546 AUD more; data from 2 RCTs with 80 participants). We are uncertain of the effect of delivering IV anti-cancer therapy at home, versus a local GP surgery, on the response to and management of adverse events. No studies reported on hospital inpatient admission. Evidence on additional hospital attendance within 48 hours of administration of anti-cancer therapy is of very low certainty. Low-certainty evidence suggests that compared to receiving treatment in a local GP surgery, participants may or may not be more likely to prefer future treatments at home, and delivering anti-cancer therapy at home may make little or no difference to the cost of the treatment. Evidence on the safety and cost-effectiveness of IV anti-cancer therapy at home is scarce and outdated. IV anti-cancer regimens have evolved; the findings of studies performed more than a decade ago may lack applicability to current practice. However, key considerations when considering suitability for home treatment remain unchanged: safety, duration of treatment and geographic catchment area. The finding that patients may prefer future treatments at home after receiving treatment in this setting, albeit based upon low-certainty evidence, is consistent with the widespread current practice of delivering IV anti-cancer therapy, including immunotherapies, at home when judged safe and preferred by the patient. Appropriate selection of patients and regimens is a key consideration for ensuring the safety of delivering IV anti-cancer therapy at home.",Rischin D,Department of Medical Oncology,

40260081,Recommendations for Improving Discharge-Related Care Following a COPD Exacerbation: An Expert Panel Consensus with Emphasis on Low- and Middle-Income Countries.,2025-04-22,International journal of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,10.2147/COPD.S502971,"Exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) continue to place a considerable disease and financial burden on both patients and healthcare systems, particularly in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Therefore, preventing future exacerbations remains a key treatment goal. However, gaps remain in the standard of COPD care following exacerbations, despite the availability of evidence-based recommendations providing guidance on discharging patients from hospital or emergency department (ED) after a COPD exacerbation. To better understand these gaps in clinical practice, an advisory board meeting of 13 international pulmonologists was convened in September 2022, with the principal objective to formulate and recommend an evidence-based hospital discharge protocol following a COPD exacerbation, with a particular focus on LMICs. Based on identified gaps in COPD care, recommendations for alleviating the burden of exacerbations were proposed, which could be delivered as a discharge protocol for implementation in hospitals and/or ED. Following a review of the available clinical evidence, including an online survey of 11 pre-meeting questions and 5 additional questions discussed during the meeting, the key unmet needs identified by the experts included poor integration of standardized protocols in routine clinical practice, failure to ensure consistent delivery of post-discharge care, and lack of efficiently functioning healthcare systems. A protocol was formulated for delivery as part of a disease management program involving an interdisciplinary approach and a care bundle, aiming to address gaps in discharge-related care by determining the likelihood of readmission and optimizing maintenance treatment plans based on assessment of symptoms and future exacerbation risk. This can provide holistic care following hospital/ED discharge and personalized treatment plans by advocating referral to a specialist. To ensure wide-ranging uptake, implementation of a discharge protocol will need to be tailored to local healthcare settings by conducting feasibility studies, standardizing clinical pathways and healthcare policies, and engaging relevant stakeholders.",Bardin P; Idrees M,Department of Medicine; Australia Monash Lung,

Currently, there are no biomarkers in clinical use to predict treatment response. A predictor of treatment response may be the B-cell compartment, as this is altered in RA patients, making it a potential candidate for predicting treatment response. In this study, we sought to identify B-cell subset(s) at diagnosis that might be associated with Clinical Disease Activity Index (CDAI) remission at 24-week follow-up. Seventy early RA patients from the NORD-STAR trial, recruited from two Swedish sites, and 28 matched healthy controls, were included in this spin-off study. In NORD-STAR, all patients were randomized to methotrexate (MTX) combined with 1) prednisolone, 2) anti-TNF (certolizumab-pegol), 3) CTLA4-Ig (abatacept), or 4) anti-IL-6R (tocilizumab). Circulating B-cell subsets at diagnosis were assessed by flow cytometry. The primary outcome measure was remission according to CDAI ≤ 2.8. A multivariate two-part discriminant analysis was performed to assess whether B-cell subpopulations at diagnosis could predict remission at 24 weeks. Subsequent univariable statistical analyses were performed using t-tests, Mann-Whitney U, or Kruskal-Wallis tests, as appropriate. Correlations were analyzed using Spearman or Pearson tests, depending on data type. The impact of specific B-cell populations on remission at week 24 was assessed using logistic regression models. The logistic regression model was also used to simultaneously visualize the sensitivity and specificity of the model for all possible values of the exposure (B-cell subpopulations) in predicting the outcome.

We examined the use of mean alpha and delta wave power value indices during sleep to identify major depressive disorder using a portable electroencephalography device. We compared the mean alpha and delta wave power value indices of six unmedicated patients with major depressive disorder and seven age- and sex-matched healthy controls using a portable electroencephalography device in this case-controlled study. The ratio of the mean alpha power values for the non-rapid and rapid eye movement periods was significantly lower in the major depressive disorder group (1.3 ± 0.2) than in the healthy group (2.3 ± 0.6; P = 0.004). The ratio of the mean delta power values for the non-rapid eye movement and rapid eye movement periods did not differ between groups but negatively correlated significantly with the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression score (r = -0.784, P = 0.002). The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (95% confidence interval) of the mean alpha power ratio for non-rapid eye movement and rapid eye movement periods for distinguishing the two groups was 0.93 (0.78-1.00), and both sensitivity and specificity exceeded 85% at a cut-off value ≤ 1.71.

Ambient ionization, particularly desorption electrospray ionization (DESI), coupled to high-resolution mass spectrometry has the advantages of minimal requirements for sample preparation before analysis, which renders it suitable for high-throughput screening, in which the accurate mass and potentially the tandem mass spectrometry (MS) fingerprint for any given product can be used for identification. We present a protocol that permits the application of this method in routine biotechnology and chemical biology laboratories that are using engineered enzymes (such as imine reductases and carboxylic acid reductases, mentioned herein) to produce target compounds from substrates (quinoline moieties and phenyl(piperazinyl) moieties, respectively). Through the use of DESI's MS imaging capabilities, reaction monitoring can be easily visualized via imaging of selected substrate or product ions in a convenient, user-friendly workflow. We describe here how DESI-MS can be used to directly analyze the activity of biotransformations from crude cell lysate, which we term 'DiBT-MS'. The DiBT-MS method presented here is 10-1,000 times as fast as liquid chromatography-MS, with the full procedure for 96 samples taking ~2 h and consuming far less solvent and sample. Also demonstrated in this protocol is the impact of solvent spray composition on ionization efficiency of the target analyte, the benefits of a nylon membrane slide and the reusability of sample slides in multiple experiments.",,,perdita.barran@manchester.ac.uk.

Previously, we identified a connection between drug-induced liver injury (DILI) and the inhibition of CYP1A1 or CYP1B1, reporting the usefulness of this inhibition data from these cytochrome P450s (P450s) for predicting DILI. This study aimed to investigate the utility of P450 inhibition data in predicting drug-induced organ toxicities beyond DILI. We selected 364 drugs with ADR information as test drugs from the public database SIDER (Side Effect Resource). Our focus was on 10 groups of ADRs affecting the liver, kidney, heart, blood/hematopoietic system, intestines, muscle, and lungs, as classified by MedDRA. The inhibitory activities of 10 human P450s were evaluated in vitro using recombinant enzymes and luminescent substrates. Our analyses revealed notable associations between heart failure and the inhibition of CYP1A1, CYP1B1, and CYP3A4. Heart failure-positive drugs tended to exhibit strong inhibition of these P450s compared to heart failure-negative drugs.

Evidence mainly derives from studies in secondary care, though most treatment occurs in primary care. This review examined efficacy of CBT, cognitive therapy (CT), or behavioural activation (BA) for depression within primary care. Databases were searched for trials up to 23rd July 2024. Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool, version 2.0.44 studies were included. CBT, CT, and BA significantly reduced depression symptoms compared to inactive controls (k = 40, g = 0.44, p < .001), but not active comparators (other therapies, medication or exercise) (k = 9, g = -0.06, p = .24). Heterogeneity was significant in studies comparing CBT, CT, or BA to inactive controls, but not in studies using active comparators. Most studies were rated at high risk of bias (36 studies, 81.8 %), predominantly due to use of patient-rated outcome measures in non-blinded studies, lack of ITT analyses, and lack of pre-registering protocols, all of which may result in inflated effect sizes. Although CBT, CT, or BA appears effective for depression in primary care against usual care or waiting list controls, when compared to active comparators no significant difference is seen, likely a result of variability in the quality of the included studies. Large studies of improved quality (including use of blinded observer-rated outcome measures and ITT analyses) may be required to justify guideline recommendations for CBT over other interventions for depression specifically in primary care.",,,jess.kerr-gaffney@kcl.ac.uk.

The overall PS80 degradation was monitored by a fluorescence micelle assay (FMA) and the oxidation products were characterized by mass spectrometry (MS). Three metal ions, Cu(II), Co(II), and Fe(III), induced significant PS80 degradation and solutions containing these ions were subjected to further mechanistic studies. The extent of oxidation was dependent on both metal and peroxide concentrations. PS80 degradation catalyzed by Cu(II) and Co(II) was completely prevented by 250 µM and 500 µM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), but only partially inhibited when catalyzed by Fe(III). The role for superoxide radical anion in the initiation of PS80 oxidation was examined by addition of Cu,Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD).

In this article, we studied CSF catecholamines in former professional and college American football players and examined the relationship with football proxies of RHI exposure, CTE probability, cognitive performance, neuropsychiatric symptoms, and parkinsonism. In this observational cross-sectional study, we examined male former American football players, professional (""PRO"") or college (""COL"") level, and asymptomatic unexposed male (""UE"") individuals from the DIAGNOSE CTE Research Project. Catecholamines-norepinephrine (NE) and its metabolite, 3,4-dihydroxyphenylglycol (DHPG), and dopamine (DA) and its precursor, 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (l-DOPA), and metabolite, 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC)-were measured in CSF with high-performance liquid chromatography and compared across groups with analysis of covariance. Multivariable linear regression models tested the relationship between CSF catecholamines and proxies of RHI exposure (e.g., total years of playing American football), factor scores for cognition, and neurobehavioral dysregulation (explosivity, emotional dyscontrol, impulsivity, affective lability), as well as depressive/anxiety symptoms, measured with the Beck Depression/Anxiety Inventories. CTE probability and parkinsonism were assessed using the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke consensus diagnostic criteria for traumatic encephalopathy syndrome (TES), and biomarkers were compared among different diagnostic groups. The cohort consisted of 120 former American football players (85 PRO players, 35 COL players) and 35 UE participants (age 45-75). Former players had significantly lower levels of NE (mean difference = -0.114, 95% CI -0.190 to -0.038), l-DOPA (-0.121, 95% CI -0.109 to -0.027), and DOPAC (-0.116, 95% CI -0.177 to -0.054) than UE participants. For NE and DOPAC, these overall group differences were primarily due to differences between the PRO and UE cohorts. No significant differences were found across TES-CTE probability subgroups or TES-parkinsonism diagnostic groups. Within the COL cohort, tested as post hoc analyses, higher CSF NE and l-DOPA were associated with higher neurobehavioral dysregulation factor scores, BAI total score, and worse executive functioning and processing speed. CSF DHPG and DOPAC were associated with impulsivity only in this subgroup.

Artificial intelligence is a group of technologies including machine learning and natural language processing that are revolutionizing multiple industries through intelligent automation. Here, we present a critical evaluation of studies leveraging artificial intelligence in signal management to characterize the benefits and limitations of the technology, the level of transparency, and our perspective on best practices for the future. To this end, PubMed and Embase were searched cumulatively for terms pertaining to signal management and artificial intelligence, machine learning, or natural language processing. Information pertaining to the artificial intelligence model used, hyperparameter settings, training/testing data, performance, feature analysis, and more was extracted from included articles. Common signal detection methods included k-means, random forest, and gradient boosting machine. Machine learning algorithms generally outperformed traditional frequentist or Bayesian measures of disproportionality per various metrics, showing the potential utility of advanced machine learning technologies in signal detection. In signal validation and evaluation, natural language processing was typically applied. Overall, methodological transparency was mixed and only some studies leveraged ""gold standard"" publicly available positive and negative control datasets.

The efficacy analysis (n = 167) showed that isatuximab 20 mg/kg monotherapy was effective in the treatment of individuals with RRMM, with an overall response rate (ORR) of 26.3%, a median progression-free survival (PFS) of 5.6 months and a median overall survival (OS) of 20.2 months. Isatuximab demonstrated rapid and sustained efficacy when used as monotherapy, with a median time to response of 1.0 month and a median duration of response of 10.3 months. The safety analysis, which included 477 participants from four clinical trials, showed that isatuximab had an acceptable safety profile that was consistent across all the dose groups examined. The most common treatment-emergent adverse events were infusion reactions (in 45.7% of participants), most of which were of grade 1 or 2 severity and occurred during the first infusion. Overall, no safety concerns were identified. In addition, participants aged ≥ 75 years had higher ORR and longer PFS and OS than those aged < 65 years, and since the proportions of patients with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 2 did not vary significantly by age group, it appears that age does not affect the efficacy and safety of isatuximab treatment in RRMM.

In contrast to fibrosis, the NAS group correlated with noninvasive imaging readouts and blood biomarkers of liver damage and inflammation (ALT, AST). The prevalence of type 2 diabetes and obesity increased with the NAS stage. Bulk RNA-seq profiling of patient liver biopsies revealed gene signatures that were positively and negatively associated with NAS. Known marker genes for liver fibrosis where upregulated on RNA level. Blood bulk RNA-seq showed only moderate differences in patients versus healthy controls.

Since the advent of  A comprehensive literature search was carried out in multiple databases to select articles/reviews on historical developments, manufacturing and analytical techniques, regulatory frameworks and clinical trials undertaken to assess gonadotrophin production, formulation processes and their integration into clinical practice. The analysis included mainly evidence from pharmaceutical sponsored randomised controlled trials (RCTs) as well as single arm, registration or post approval studies. Studies on new molecular entities were reviewed. Systematic reviews and meta-analyses, national registries were consulted. Laboratory developments, regulatory challenges, economic constraints, were considered. Over the past four decades, ART has seen remarkable improvements, including increased live birth rates in women of advanced ovarian age, reduced multiple births, and the advent of patient-friendly pen devices. Innovations such as recombinant FSH (rFSH) and biosimilars have expanded treatment options. However, the high cost of drug development as well as the complexity of the ART process have contributed to underpowered trials and reliance on meta-analyses, which often fail to account for confounding factors. While gonadotrophins have been shown to be effective for OS, unresolved issues, such as the role of supplementing LH activity in OS protocols, highlight the need for more robust trials. Collaboration between stakeholders is essential to standardise trial designs, define key outcomes and minimise bias. Emerging technologies, including AI and genetic testing, offer opportunities to refine embryo assessment and implantation outcomes, thus improving trial design. A renewed focus on rigorous, transparent trials and interdisciplinary collaboration is essential to advance patient care and address unmet challenges in ART treatment. Beyond gonadotrophins, alternative therapeutic avenues to improve oocyte competence and implantation success warrant exploration.",Bassett R; Howles CM,Oasthouse Consulting Sàrl; ARIES Consulting Sàrl,

40254626,Should we stay or should we go? Recent insights on drug discontinuation in multiple sclerosis.,,Neurological research and practice,10.1186/s42466-025-00379-y,"The decision to discontinue disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) in patients with multiple sclerosis (PwMS) is a critical clinical challenge. Historically, DMTs were discontinued due to side effects, treatment limitations, or progression to secondary progressive MS. However, advancements in MS therapies, particularly high-efficacy DMTs (HE-DMTs) and the increased knowledge on disease courses and phenotypes have resulted in more personalized treatment approaches and introduced discussion on scheduled DMT discontinuation. This review explores the current evidence on DMT discontinuation, focusing on its implications for aging populations and the interplay between cardiovascular diseases (CVD) and MS. Randomized trials such as DISCOMS and DOT-MS have provided insights into discontinuing DMTs in stable patients. In summary, both randomized clinical trials highlight the risk of disease reactivation following treatment discontinuation. Due to the limited sample size, neither study was able to conduct subgroup analyses based on age groups. Additionally, DOT-MS was terminated prematurely, direct comparisons with other studies should be avoided. While older studies and observational data (e.g., OFSEP) have shown relapse risks associated with discontinuation, particularly for drugs like natalizumab and fingolimod, there is limited data on HE-DMT discontinuation outcomes. Comorbidities, particularly CVDs, further complicate decisions regarding the continuation of DMTs in older adults. MS patients bear a higher burden of CVD, which is also associated with unfavorable disease courses. While optimizing cardiovascular risk profiles appears advisable, it remains unclear whether DMTs themselves have a positive impact on CVDs. Given the complexities associated with discontinuing DMTs in MS patients, it is essential to balance the avoidance of polypharmacy with the potential risks of disease reactivation and the impact of comorbidities, especially CVDs, on disease progression. The interplay between MS and CVD highlights the importance of a holistic risk assessment when considering DMT discontinuation.",,,steffen.Pfeuffer@neuro.med.uni-giessen.de.

Nationwide registry-based cohort study of Danish patients with RA and one of the six algorithm-specific solid cancers in remission (breast, colorectal, melanoma, bladder, endometrial and lung) who initiated treatment with a bDMARD or a csDMARD. Three bDMARD exposure groups were defined according to the type(s) of bDMARD initiated: (1) any bDMARD, (2) tumour necrosis factor inhibitors (TNFi) and (3) rituximab. Patients were identified in Danish Rheumatology Quality Register and followed for cancer recurrence from 2002 to 2021 using validated cancer-specific recurrence algorithms. Inverse probability of treatment weighting and weighted cause-specific Cox models were used to calculate HRs for cancer recurrence in each bDMARD exposure group compared with a csDMARD-treated group. Among 720 unique patients with RA and an algorithm-specific solid cancer in remission, 170 any bDMARD, 81 TNFi, 99 rituximab and 651 csDMARD initiators were identified. No statistically significant increased HRs for cancer recurrence were found with any type of bDMARD 0.92 (95% CI 0.38 to 1.73), TNFi 1.10 (95% CI 0.21 to 3.16) or rituximab 0.94 (95% CI 0.32 to 2.11).

This proof-of-principle study aimed to characterize platelet properties in cirrhotic children before living-donor liver transplantation using state-of-the-art platelet-based assays, hypothesizing that primary hemostasis in this group is well preserved. From January 2022 to July 2023, pediatric cirrhotic patients were prospectively enrolled 1 day before liver transplantation. An age-matched control group was included. Platelet functionality was assessed using flow cytometry and microfluidic assays, along with plasma proteins including von Willebrand factor (VWF), a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with a thrombospondin type 13, and soluble glycoprotein VI. A subset of patients was also re-evaluated 3 months after transplant. Twenty-seven pediatric cirrhotic patients, primarily with cholestatic liver disease, and 15 controls were enrolled. Patients had pediatric end-stage liver disease scores from -10 to 44. Flow cytometry revealed subtle platelet activation in the absence of agonists and reduced activation with high agonist concentrations. Microfluidic assays revealed variations in platelet thrombus formation among the patients, identifying 2 distinct subgroups: 1 with severe liver disease and higher platelet counts, showing preserved primary hemostasis, and another with lower platelet count and moderate platelet thrombus impairment. High VWF levels likely compensated for reduced platelet activation under high shear. Two subgroups with differences in platelet thrombus formation under flow were identified pretransplantation, likely depending on severity of liver disease, platelet count, and VWF levels. Whether the need for platelet intervention is different between these subgroups requires further clinical investigation.",Brusa D; Dahlqvist G; Coubeau L; Hermans C; Tambucci R; Pirotte T; de Magnee C; Horman S,Transplantation and Abdominal Surgery Section; Pôle de Recherche Cardiovasculaire (CARD); CytoFlux Platform; Haemostasis and Thrombosis Unit; Pediatric Surgery and Transplantation Unit; Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology; Department of Anesthesiology,marie-astrid.vandievoet@saintluc.uclouvain.be.

S. sanguinis strain SK36 produces pili comprising PilA, PilB, and PilC. This study determined whether the ssa1635 gene adjacent to the pilus-related gene locus encodes a pilus component and its roles in biofilm formation and eukaryotic cell adhesion. Using a series of mutant strains and antisera against PilA, PilB, PilC, and SSA1635, immunoblot analyses and immunoprecipitation assays were performed for SSA1635 characterization. Both the involvement of the deduced pilus-specific transpeptidase SrtC in pilus assembly and SSA1635 localization were examined by immunoblot analysis of various mutant strains. Furthermore, biofilm formation assays on saliva-coated surfaces and adhesion to HeLa cells were performed to assess their functions. SSA1635, designated as PilX, formed complexes with PilA, PilB, and PilC. PilX was identified as a tip pilin incorporated into the pilus structure by SrtC. Notably, the deletion of pilX impaired the polymerization of other pilins. Furthermore, a pilX deletion mutant exhibited decreased biofilm formation compared with the wild-type and revertant strains and comparable rates of adherence to HeLa cells. PilX is a potential pilin tip that may aid in facilitating the polymerization of other pilins. PilX contributes to biofilm formation, although it appears to be dispensable for adhesion to HeLa cells.

This study aims to evaluate the clinical efficacy of carbon nanoparticle suspensions (CNSs) in guiding sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) for cervical cancer patients. Systematic search of China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Cqvip, Wanfang, PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library from inception until June 2024. Studies on cervical cancer patients receiving SLNB with CNSs are included. An individual participant data meta-analysis was conducted. The protocol was prospectively registered on the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO: CRD42024569290). In total, 26 publications involving 1671 patients were analyzed. The overall detection rate of CNSs in SLNB for cervical cancer was 0.92, with bilateral and unilateral detection rates of 0.74 and 0.20, respectively. This detection rate exhibited a correlation with lesion size and the administration of neoadjuvant chemotherapy. The pooled sensitivity, specificity, positive likelihood ratio, and negative likelihood ratio were 0.93 (95% CI: 0.88-0.96, I2 = 35.89%), 1.00 (95% CI: 0.98-1.00, I2 = 90.01%), 216.84 (95% CI: 40.47-1161.85, I2 = 77.68%), and 0.07 (95% CI: 0.05-0.12, I2 = 54.96%), respectively.

Although the therapeutic landscape has long been dominated by off-label therapy, new treatments are emerging. Limited guidance on how to safely and effectively utilize available therapies poses challenges for healthcare providers. Herein, we provide generally accepted principles, consensus recommendations, and a treatment algorithm for the management of vitiligo, as developed by a panel of ten Canadian dermatologists with expertise in managing vitiligo. The three-phase process consisted of identifying themes and research questions; conducting a systematic literature review; and discussing/voting on generally accepted principles, consensus statements, and a treatment algorithm using an iterative consensus process. Experts agreed to 27 generally accepted principles, ten consensus statements, and a treatment algorithm. Education about vitiligo pathogenesis and repigmentation biology can help patients, caregivers, and healthcare providers set realistic expectations for treatment. Treatment should focus on repigmentation or stabilizing progression, rather than on depigmentation. Topical therapies include topical corticosteroids, topical calcineurin inhibitors, and the topical Janus kinase inhibitor ruxolitinib cream. Phototherapy, such as narrow-band ultraviolet B and excimer laser/lamp, can be used as monotherapy or in combination with other treatments. Off-label systemic therapies may be appropriate for patients with unstable or rapidly progressing disease. Surgical therapy may be suitable for patients with localized or stable recalcitrant disease. Maintenance therapy may help mitigate the risk of disease relapse. Improved clarity around the benefits, risks, and limitations of available therapies has supported the development of robust guidelines and a treatment algorithm for vitiligo. Disease stabilization and repigmentation are goals that can largely be achieved, particularly when patients share a mutual understanding of vitiligo and its treatment options.

For severe chronic hand eczema, topical corticosteroids are often unsatisfactory and systemic treatment can be required. The aim of the head-to-head, phase 3 DELTA FORCE trial was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of topical delgocitinib cream versus oral alitretinoin, the only currently approved systemic drug for severe chronic hand eczema. This randomised, assessor-masked, trial was conducted at 102 trial centres in Austria, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Norway, Poland, Slovakia, Spain, and the UK. Adults (aged ≥18 years) with severe chronic hand eczema were randomly assigned (1:1) via an interactive response technology system to delgocitinib cream 20 mg/g (twice daily) or alitretinoin 30 mg (once daily) for up to 24 weeks. The primary endpoint was change in Hand Eczema Severity Index (HECSI) score from baseline to week 12. Efficacy of delgocitinib cream versus alitretinoin was assessed in all eligible randomly assigned patients who had available data at baseline, and safety was assessed in all patients exposed to trial treatment.

Between June 15, 2022, and Dec 5, 2023, 513 (334 [65%] female and 179 [35%] male) patients were randomly assigned to receive delgocitinib cream (n=254) or alitretinoin (n=259). Ten patients were excluded after randomisation due to not meeting eligibility criteria, so the full analysis set consisted of 250 patients in the delgocitinib group and 253 in the alitretinoin group. One patient in the delgocitinib group and three in the alitretinoin group were excluded from the primary analysis as they had missing HECSI data at baseline. A significantly greater least squares mean change in HECSI score from baseline to week 12 was observed with delgocitinib cream (-67·6 [SE 3·4]; n=249) versus alitretinoin (-51·5 [3·4]; n=250; difference -16·1 [95% CI -23·3 to -8·9], p<0·0001).

The Neuropathic Pain Special Interest Group aimed to update treatment recommendations, published in 2015, on the basis of new evidence from randomised controlled trials, emerging neuromodulation techniques, and advances in evidence synthesis. For this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched Embase, PubMed, the International Clinical Trials Registry, and ClinicalTrials.gov from data inception for neuromodulation trials and from Jan 1, 2013, for pharmacological interventions until Feb 12, 2024. We included double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trials that evaluated pharmacological and neuromodulation treatments administered for at least 3 weeks, or if there was at least 3 weeks of follow-up, and which included at least ten participants per group. Trials included participants of any age with neuropathic pain, defined by the International Association for the Study of Pain. We excluded trials with enriched enrolment randomised withdrawal designs and those with participants with mixed aetiologies (ie, neuropathic and non-neuropathic pain) and conditions such as complex regional pain syndrome, low back pain without radicular pain, fibromyalgia, and idiopathic orofacial pain. We extracted summary data in duplicate from published reports, with discrepancies reconciled by a third independent reviewer on the platform Covidence. The primary efficacy outcome was the proportion of responders (50% or 30% reduction in baseline pain intensity or moderate pain relief). The primary safety outcome was the number of participants who withdrew from the treatment owing to adverse events. We calculated a risk difference for each comparison and did a random-effects meta-analysis. Risk differences were used to calculate the number needed to treat (NNT) and the number needed to harm (NNH) for each treatment. Risk of bias was assessed by use of the Cochrane risk of bias tool 2 and certainty of evidence assessed by use of GRADE. Recommendations were based on evidence of efficacy, adverse events, accessibility, and cost, and feedback from engaged lived experience partners. This study is registered on PROSPERO, CRD42023389375.

Estimates for the primary efficacy and safety outcomes were tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) NNT=4·6 (95% CI 3·2-7·7), NNH=17·1 (11·4-33·6; moderate certainty of evidence), α2δ-ligands NNT=8·9 (7·4-11·10), NNH=26·2 (20·4-36·5; moderate certainty of evidence), serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) NNT=7·4 (5·6-10·9), NNH=13·9 (10·9-19·0; moderate certainty of evidence), botulinum toxin (BTX-A) NNT=2·7 (1·8-9·61), NNH=216·3 (23·5-∞; moderate certainty of evidence), capsaicin 8% patches NNT=13·2 (7·6-50·8), NNH=1129·3 (135·7-∞; moderate certainty of evidence), opioids NNT=5·9 (4·1-10·7), NNH=15·4 (10·8-24·0; low certainty of evidence), repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) NNT=4·2 (2·3-28·3), NNH=651·6 (34·7-∞; low certainty of evidence), capsaicin cream NNT=6·1 (3·1-∞), NNH=18·6 (10·6-77·1; very low certainty of evidence), lidocaine 5% plasters NNT=14·5 (7·8-108·2), NNH=178·0 (23·9-∞; very low certainty of evidence). The findings provided the basis for a strong recommendation for use of TCAs, α2δ-ligands, and SNRIs as first-line treatments; a weak recommendation for capsaicin 8% patches, capsaicin cream, and lidocaine 5% plasters as second-line recommendation; and a weak recommendation for BTX-A, rTMS, and opioids as third-line treatments for neuropathic pain. Our results support a revision of the Neuropathic Pain Special Interest Group recommendations for the treatment of neuropathic pain.

The rise of the internet has facilitated the risk of online child sexual solicitation and abuse (OCSSA), a critical issue that warrants particular attention and must not be overlooked. This study examines the prevalence of OCSSA, distinguishing between online child sexual abuse (OCSA) and online sexual solicitation (OSS) in Germany, and explores generational differences. A representative German sample of 3098 participants aged 18-96 was assessed. The 18-29 age group was oversampled, and the results were weighted accordingly. Participants completed screening questions on OCSSA experiences. Descriptive statistics, Chi In the general population, 10.3 % reported experiencing at least one form of OCSSA, with 2.8 % reporting OCSA, and 9.3 % OSS. Among younger participants aged 18-29, prevalence was significantly higher at 31.6 % for OCSSA, 3.5 % for OCSA, and 29.6 % for OSS. The most common experiences among younger participants were exposure to pornographic material (21.1 %) and sexualized conversation (15.0 %). Age was the main predictor of OCSSA. OCSSA is significantly more prevalent among younger generations in Germany, likely due to increased exposure to digital environments during childhood coupled with the proliferation of the internet and social media in recent decades. These findings highlight the urgent need for targeted prevention efforts addressing online risks.",,,Katrin.chauvire-geib@uniklinik-ulm.de.

This trend is likely driven by environmental factors such as nanoplastics (NPs) ingestion and the westernization of dietary and lifestyle habits. This study examines the impact of polystyrene nanoplastics (PS-NPs) on ovalbumin (OVA)-induced food allergies in mice subjected to either a normal diet (ND) or a high-fat diet (HFD). BALB/c mice were stratified into eight groups based on dietary regimen, NP exposure, and OVA sensitization. Food allergy was induced via OVA administration, and multiple physiological and immunological parameters were evaluated, including body weight, intestinal permeability, cytokine profiles, gut microbiota composition, and small intestinal gene expression. Mice in the HFD + OVA + NP group exhibited significant increases in intestinal permeability, diarrhea severity, and serum OVA-specific IgE levels compared to other groups. Flow cytometric analysis revealed an expansion of innate lymphoid cells (ILC2 and ILC1) within the lamina propria of the small intestine. Shotgun metagenomic sequencing demonstrated gut microbiota dysbiosis, characterized by a reduction in beneficial bacterial populations in the HFD + OVA + NP cohort. Weighted Gene Co-Expression Network Analysis (WGCNA) identified a negative correlation between NPs exposure or OVA sensitization and the expression of Slc1a1, Slc5a8, and Mep1a, while a positive correlation was observed with Aa467197 expression. These findings indicate that oral exposure to PS-NPs exacerbates OVA-induced food allergies, particularly in the context of an HFD, through mechanisms involving increased intestinal permeability, gut microbial dysbiosis, and gene expression modulation. This study highlights the potential health hazards posed by environmental microplastic contamination and its possible contribution to the escalating incidence of food allergies.",,,mhama@koto.kpu-m.ac.jp.

This study aims to examine the industrial and health consequences of compulsory licensing when applied by a high-income country. Our literature review found that the impact of compulsory licensing is challenging to predict as it can have multiple (opposing) consequences in terms of economic activity, patient outcomes and public health. Compulsory licensing can, under particular circumstances, serve as a lever of industrial policy in a country that wishes to develop its domestic generic pharmaceutical industry. However, originator pharmaceutical companies and other industries may reduce investment, which can be negative for countries with a high presence of innovators, adversely impacting long-term economic activity. Compulsory licensing may also induce state retaliation against the license-issuing country. From a health policy perspective, compulsory licensing likely increases patient access to expensive medicines and frees up resources that can be invested in other (health) programs. However, pharmaceutical companies may delay medicine launches or cancel clinical trials in the license-issuing country. Although there are benefits resulting from a credible threat to use compulsory licensing, the overall desirability of actually using it depends on the specific context and needs to be assessed on a case-by-case basis.",Simoens S; Janssens R; Barbier L; Luyten J,Department of Public Health and Primary Care; Department of Pharmaceutical and Pharmacological Sciences,stevensimoens16@gmail.com.

Criticism focuses on their oversimplification and misapplication, which fail to capture the complexity of human health and genetic diversity. There is growing recognition that these categories, rooted in outdated social constructs, do not accurately reflect biological differences. Historically, race and ethnicity have been used as proxies for genetic variation and skin color, despite the understanding that these constructs are not biologically defined. The Skin of Color Society's second Meeting the Challenge Summit, attended by over 100 U.S. and international participants, highlighted several key themes: (1) the need for transparency in the rationale behind using population descriptors and decision-making processes; (2) recognizing the role of race and racism in dermatology; (3) exploring the intersection of dermatology, skin color, and cultural influences; (4) understanding the context of population descriptor usage; (5) developing improved, objective tools for classifying skin color; and (6) advancing research and creating guidelines. There is an urgent need to reconsider the use of race and ethnicity as population descriptors in dermatology research. Current systems, which conflate social identity with biological markers, perpetuate health disparities and limit the accuracy of clinical data. Moving forward, more specific descriptors such as skin color, alongside socially determined factors, will be crucial in achieving meaningful diversity and inclusivity in clinical research.",Sundaram H,Dermatology,valerieharvey10@gmail.com.

This study investigated patterns in willingness to share personal health information among Japanese adults and identified factors influencing their sharing decisions. A nationwide cross-sectional web-based survey was conducted among 20,000 Japanese adults in December 2023. Participants were recruited through quota sampling based on age, gender, and prefecture population ratios from the 2020 National Census. The survey examined willingness to share personal health information with nine types of recipients (healthcare providers, ambulance crew, application providers, family members, local authorities, employers, pharmaceutical companies, government agencies, and research institutions), trust levels in these recipients, and 17 factors influencing sharing decisions across health benefits, convenience, economic incentives, social significance, information details, transparency, and privacy considerations. Clustering analysis using Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) and Ordering Points to Identify the Clustering Structure (OPTICS) algorithms was performed to identify distinct patterns in sharing preferences. Despite low PHR familiarity (88.4% unfamiliar), participants showed willingness to share health information with healthcare providers (65.0%) and family members (65.6%), but expressed lower willingness toward government agencies (28.6%) and research institutions (28.8%). Five distinct clusters were identified: family-only sharers (3.9%), mixed preference sharers (47.9%), comprehensive sharers (12.9%), non-sharers (22.1%), and healthcare-selective sharers (13.2%). Trust levels were highest for family members (85.6%) and healthcare professionals (78.8%), while significantly lower for government agencies (44.2%). Higher education, income, and PHR familiarity were associated with greater willingness to share, while privacy and security concerns were universal across all clusters. The heterogeneous patterns in health information sharing preferences suggest the need for tailored PHR implementation strategies that address varying privacy concerns and trust levels across different population segments. Success in PHR adoption requires balanced approaches to trust-building, robust data protection, and targeted communication strategies that acknowledge diverse user needs while promoting the benefits of health data sharing.",,,s-nomura@keio.jp.

Longitudinal scans from patients with LITT-treated BM were retrospectively analyzed. Treatment response was categorized as durable response, long-term disease control (i.e., stable at 1 year), stable disease < 1 year, or progression < 1 year. Volumetric and diffusion MRI changes after LITT were analyzed for each subregion (contrast-enhancing, central non-enhancing, whole lesion). Volumetric changes were modeled with bi-exponential fits in responding lesions and progressors. 295 MRI scans from 47 lesions across 42 patients (57.8 ± 14.3 years old, males:females 21:21) were analyzed. Overall, the post-LITT scan showed a lesion enlargement (p < 0.0001 for all subregions), more pronounced in the contrast-enhancing (CE) component (median = +77%, p < 0.0001), and a reduction in the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) (p < 0.001), especially in the central non-CE component (median = -224 × 10 BM typically exhibit an early volume increase with diffusion restriction after LITT. Responders then show bi-exponential shrinkage with gradual diffusion increase. Progression can usually be detected only after 3-4 months, because earlier radiographic patterns may overlap with responding lesions. Question Laser interstitial thermal therapy (LITT) is an emerging local treatment for brain metastases, but the radiographic patterns following this treatment have not been thoroughly described. Findings Responding lesions showed a typical radiographic pattern with early volumetric enlargement and diffusion restriction (not exclusive of responders), followed by a bi-exponential shrinkage and diffusion elevation. Clinical relevance Being aware of the typical radiographic changes in brain metastases responding to LITT is informative for the interpretation of follow-up images. Early volumetric and diffusion changes (< 3-4 months) do not appear to be reliable markers to predict treatment success.",,,fsanvito@mednet.ucla.edu.

Commercial products have rarely been studied in the same experimental setup, and in the case of lipid-based products, their baseline capabilities to target central defects of DED requires a more thorough investigation. This study aims to discern potential differences in their abilities to stabilize the tear film, reduce the evaporation of water, and impact on corneal epithelial cell viability and recovery utilizing various biophysical and biological in vitro techniques. Seven commercial lipid-based eye drops (Cationorm®, Desodrop®, Evotears®, Oxyal® Triple Action, Puro™ Suoja, Systane® Complete, Thealipid®) were selected for the in vitro biophysical and biological profiling studies. Biophysical properties critical for tear film stability and evaporation reduction were evaluated using Langmuir trough techniques, while cell viability and recovery were assessed by an MTT assay after exposing either healthy or damaged human corneal epithelial cells to the products. The majority of the products spread reasonably well at the aqueous-air interface, suggesting that they bear intrinsic properties which may be beneficial to improving the coverage of the tear film lipid layer. However, only subtle evaporation reduction capabilities were observed, indicating that the products are not optimal at targeting this defect. Clear differences in cell viability and recovery were observed, with three of the products being able to promote the recovery of damaged cells. The significance of our findings with regards to DED treatment outcomes will require additional studies in the future.",,,filip.ekholm@helsinki.fi.

However, despite their potential, the reliability and robustness of these techniques are often compromised by estimation errors from curve fitting, a crucial limitation that has been largely overlooked. To address this, we propose a novel QSAR method that directly leverages in vivo PK data from intravenous and oral administrations by implicitly integrating a deep neural network with a two-compartmental model. The model uses the chemical structure of the compounds along with in vitro/in silico absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) features as input data and was trained on in vivo mouse PK data encompassing 1,162 compounds across 30 in-house projects.

Oncology,10.1016/S1470-2045(25)00139-1,"Cell-free, circulating tumour DNA (ctDNA) is an established measure of minimal residual disease; however, it is not utilised in melanoma management. We investigated whether ctDNA measurements could predict survival outcomes during adjuvant targeted therapy or placebo treatment in stage III melanoma, thereby identifying patients at high risk and low risk of recurrence. Analytically validated mutation-specific droplet digital PCR assays were used to measure BRAF Baseline plasma samples were available for 597 of 870 patients (331 male patients and 266 female patients) and samples for assessing the ctDNA positivity rate at landmark follow-up timepoints of 3 months, 6 months, 9 months, and 12 months after treatment initiation were available for 94 of 870 patients. Additionally, samples were available from 118 of 870 patients within a 2-month timeframe before or after clinical or radiographic recurrence. Median follow-up for the biomarker analyses was 60 months (IQR 39-66) in the combination therapy group and 58 months (21-66) for the placebo group. ctDNA was detectable in 79 (13%) of 597 baseline samples. ctDNA positivity rate and mutant copies per mL plasma were significantly higher in patients with higher disease substages. As a binary variable, ctDNA detection was associated with worse recurrence-free survival (placebo group: median 3·71 months [95% CI 2·39-6·89] vs 24·41 months [17·28-43·13]; hazard ratio [HR] 2·91 [95% CI 1·99-4·25], p<0·0001); combination therapy group: median 16·59 months [95% CI 12·02-26·80] vs 68·11 months [50·36-not reached]; HR 2·98 [1·95-4·54], p<0·0001) and overall survival (placebo group: median 33·90 months [13·96-not reached] vs not reached; HR 3·35 [2·01-5·55], p<0·0001); combination therapy group: median 40·31 months [24·90-not reached] vs not reached; HR 4·27 [2·50-7·27], p<0·0001) in the placebo group and combination therapy groups. Baseline ctDNA was more strongly associated with survival outcomes than IFNG gene expression or tumour mutational burden. Patients with adverse longitudinal ctDNA kinetics (molecular relapse or persistently positive) had markedly shorter median recurrence-free survival (8·31 months [95% CI 5·39-12·20] and 5·32 months [2·79-not reached], respectively) compared with patients with favourable kinetics (ie, undetectable after positive baseline result: 19·25 months [16·39-not reached]; and durable undetectable: not reached [38·44-not reached], p<0·0001). Droplet digital PCR measurements of ctDNA to assess minimal residual disease before adjuvant targeted therapy and during follow-up can identify patients at high risk of early recurrence. Additional studies using ctDNA measurements to guide therapeutic interventions might lead to improvements in the management of resected stage III melanoma.

With the widespread adoption of comprehensive diagnostics, including comprehensive genomic profiling (CGP) tests for solid tumors, many patients with BRCA1/2 variants have been identified. In this study, we extracted and analyzed cases of BRCA1/2 variants that were presumed to be germline, which were repeatedly detected using the CGP test for solid tumors in northeastern Japan. The frequencies of BRCA1/2 variants in regional areas were compared with those of healthy individuals or nationwide cancer cohorts to investigate regional distribution. Our findings revealed regional disparities in BRCA1/2 pathogenic germline variants, while variants of unknown significance (VUS) showed no such differences. The regional distribution of BRCA1 and BRCA2 variants showed distinct patterns: pathogenic variants of BRCA1 exhibited regional differences and were less prevalent compared to VUS, whereas BRCA2 variants, including both pathogenic variants and VUS, did not exhibit such clear regional localization. This discrepancy in regional distribution between BRCA1 and BRCA2 variants could be attributed to factors such as the diversity of the genome, gender differences, and cancer types. These results highlight the importance of considering regional differences in comparative cohort studies, particularly in assessing the differential extension of mutations in pathogenic changes and VUS. Moreover, a presumption of pathogenicity variants would need to be discussed at the regional level.",,,

Clinical trials have shown that recombinant zoster vaccine (RZV) significantly reduces the risk of developing HZ. Hence, RZV is recommended by the US Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) for adults aged ≥50 years and immunocompromised adults aged ≥19 years. However, RZV uptake varies across age groups, and is lower for adults aged 50-59 compared to those aged ≥60 years. Using a cross-sectional web-based survey, this study described provider knowledge of HZ risk factors, ACIP recommendations, attitudes toward HZ vaccination, and HZ vaccination practices/barriers. Among 301 licensed PCPs in the US, knowledge of HZ risk factors was high, but only 29% were fully aware of the ACIP recommendations. PCPs indicated that HZ vaccination was important for patients aged 50-59, 60-69, and ≥70 years, with importance increasing with advancing age. During a typical week, an average of 44% (standard deviation = 32%) of PCPs reported initiating a conversation about HZ vaccination among adults aged 50-59 years. Key perceived barriers to recommending HZ vaccines to adults were contraindications and insufficient time to assess risk factors, while perceived HZ vaccine administration challenges included patients' out-of-pocket costs and lack of motivation. Results suggest that PCPs may benefit from updated information about ACIP recommendations, while both patients and providers may benefit from streamlining the vaccination process and educational efforts focused on addressing perceived barriers. Shingles (herpes zoster) typically causes a painful rash on the torso, and people often develop pain at the rash site, which can last for several months. Shingles is more common in older people and those whose immune system is compromised. To help prevent shingles, a vaccine called recombinant zoster vaccine (RZV) is recommended in the United States (US) for adults aged 50 years and over and for immunocompromised adults 19 years and over. However, people aged 50–59 years are less likely to have received shingles vaccination compared to older age groups. In this study, 301 primary care providers (PCPs) in the US completed a survey about shingles and vaccination. Most PCPs knew the risk factors for shingles, but only 29% were fully aware of the shingles vaccine recommendations in the US. PCPs generally believed in the importance of vaccinating adults 50 years and over against shingles, with the perceived importance increasing with the patient’s age. The PCPs identified various barriers to shingles vaccination, but interestingly, some of these barriers were based on outdated information, particularly regarding out-of-pocket costs, which have been largely addressed by recent changes in legislation. Providing updated information to PCPs about the current vaccination recommendations for shingles prevention and addressing misconceptions could help to improve shingles prevention. Additionally, educating patients about shingles could further support improvements, and help reduce the overall burden of shingles.",Stempniewicz N; Davenport E; Wang J; Sweeney C,Biostatistics; US Medical Affairs; Surveys and Observational Studies,

Genomic and precision medicine,10.1161/CIRCGEN.124.004862,"Patients with pulmonary hypertension (PH) are classified based on disease etiology and hemodynamic drivers. Classification informs treatment. The heart failure biomarker NT-proBNP (N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide) is used to help inform risk but is not specific to PH or sub-classification groups. There are currently no other biomarkers in clinical use to help guide diagnosis or risk. We profiled a retrospective cohort of 1150 patients from 3 expert centers with PH and 334 non-PH symptomatic controls (disease controls) from the United Kingdom to measure circulating levels of 650 microRNAs (miRNAs) in serum. NT-proBNP (ELISA) and 326 well-detected miRNAs (polymerase chain reaction) were prioritized by feature selection using multiple machine learning models. From the selected miRNAs, generalized linear models were used to describe miRNA signatures to differentiate PH and pulmonary arterial hypertension from the disease controls, and pulmonary arterial hypertension, PH due to left heart disease, PH due to lung disease, and chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension from other forms of PH. These signatures were validated on a UK test cohort and independently validated in the prospective CIPHER study (A Prospective, Multicenter, Noninterventional Study for the Identification of Biomarker Signatures for the Early Detection of Pulmonary Hypertension) comprising 349 patients with PH and 93 disease controls. NT-proBNP achieved a balanced accuracy of 0.74 and 0.75 at identifying PH and pulmonary arterial hypertension from disease controls with a threshold of 254 and 362 pg/mL, respectively but was unable to sub-categorize PH subgroups. In the UK cohort, miRNA signatures performed similarly to NT-proBNP in distinguishing PH (area under the curve of 0.7 versus 0.78), and pulmonary arterial hypertension (area under the curve of 0.73 versus 0.79) from disease controls. MicroRNA signatures outperformed NT-proBNP in distinguishing PH classification groups. External testing in the CIPHER cohort demonstrated that miRNA signatures, in conjunction with NT-proBNP, age, and sex, performed better than either NT-proBNP or miRNAs alone in sub-classifying PH. We suggest a threshold for NT-proBNP to identify patients with a high probability of PH, and the subsequent use of circulating miRNA signatures to help differentiate PH subgroups.",Zhou L; Fong YL; Zhou L; Jatkoe T; Toshner M; He C,MiRXES Lab; Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson & Johnson; Papworth NHS Foundation,

Central to its pathogenesis is the dysregulation of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway, which drives fibroblast activation, epithelial-mesenchymal transition, apoptosis resistance, and cellular senescence. Senescent cells contribute to fibrosis through the secretion of pro-inflammatory and profibrotic factors in the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP).

The reward deficiency syndrome (RDS) model proposes blunted responses to natural rewards that potentially contribute to the development of addictive behaviors. The 29-item Reward Deficiency Syndrome Questionnaire (RDSQ-29) was developed to assess RDS-related psychological-behavioral characteristics. The aim of the present study was to validate the Hebrew version of the RDSQ-29 and to provide empirical evidence for the relevance of RDS in addictive behaviors and related psychological features. The sample comprised 961 Jewish Israeli young adults from the general community (age 19-27 years; M = 23.40 years [SD = 1.95]) who were assessed for personality characteristics (attachment styles, RDS, compulsive personality), internet gaming disorder (IGD), problematic use of social media use (PUSM), compulsive buying-shopping disorder (CBSD), and gambling disorder (GD). The analysis confirmed the validity and factor structure of the RDSQ-29. RDSQ-29 scores showed a significant but weak association with anxiety, avoidance, and compulsive personality. Also, weak to modest relationships were found between RDSQ-29 scores and the severity of the four potential behavioral addictions. The findings suggest that the Hebrew translation of the RDSQ-29 is a psychometrically sound instrument to assess RDS. Given that different potentially addictive and other problematic behaviors are associated with RDS, its assessment might be useful in prevention or screening.",,,

Patients with programmed death-ligand 1-positive resected NSCLC who had completed adjuvant chemotherapy without evidence of recurrence, and chemotherapy-naive patients with programmed death-ligand 1-high metastatic NSCLC were randomized 1:1 to arm A (atezolizumab SC then atezolizumab IV) or arm B (atezolizumab IV then atezolizumab SC). After cycle 3, patients switched administration routes. After cycle 6, the patients chose the route of administration for the continuation period. The primary end point was patient preference for SC or IV atezolizumab, and the secondary end points were patient- and HCP-reported outcomes and safety. A total of 179 patients were included in this study. Most patients (70.7%; n = 87 of 123) preferred SC atezolizumab over IV, with 79.4% (n = 85 of 107) choosing SC atezolizumab during the continuation period. Among the HCPs, 75.2% (n = 76 of 101) indicated that atezolizumab SC was more convenient than IV, and 77.8% (n = 77 of 99) strongly agreed or agreed that it would allow patients to spend less time in care units. No new or unexpected safety findings were identified, and switching between administration routes was well tolerated and managed. Most patients preferred SC atezolizumab over IV. There were no new safety findings, and switching between the administration routes was well tolerated. These results support the preference for SC formulations to reduce the treatment burden.",Szczesna A; Castro Sanchez AY; Bustillos A; Liu X; Young F; Tosti N; Monteiro MF,Genentech; Mazowieckie Centrum Leczenia Chorób Płuc i Gruźlicy; F.

Drug discovery,10.1038/s41573-025-01172-x,"The aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) is a ligand-activated transcription factor originally identified as the target mediating the toxic effects of environmental pollutants including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and dioxins. For years, AHR activation was actively avoided during drug development. However, the AHR was later identified as an important physiological regulator of the immune response. These findings triggered a paradigm shift that resulted in identification of the AHR as a regulator of both innate and adaptive immunity and outlined a pathway for its modulation by the diet, commensal flora and metabolism in the context of autoimmunity, cancer and infection. Moreover, the AHR was revealed as a candidate target for the therapeutic modulation of the immune response. Indeed, the first AHR-activating drug (tapinarof) was recently approved for the treatment of psoriasis. Clinical trials are underway to evaluate the effects of tapinarof and other AHR-targeting therapeutics in inflammatory diseases, cancer and infections. This Review outlines the molecular mechanism of AHR action, and describes how it regulates the immune response. We also discuss links to disease and AHR-targeting therapeutics that have been tested in past and ongoing clinical trials.",McHale KA; Rubenstein D,Dermavant Sciences Inc.,fquintana@rics.bwh.harvard.edu.

A latent class analysis (LCA) was performed on 22,668 individuals from six cohorts to identify comorbid DSM-IV SD patterns. In subsets of this sample, we tested SD-latent classes with respect to polygenic overlap of psychiatric and psychosocial traits in 7659 individuals of European descent and epigenome-wide changes in 886 individuals of African, European, and Admixed-American descents. The LCA identified four latent classes related to SD comorbidities: AD + TD, CoD + TD, AD + CoD + OD + TD (i.e., polysubstance addiction, PSU), and TD. In the epigenome-wide association analysis, SPATA4 cg02833127 was associated with CoD + TD, AD + TD, and PSU latent classes. AD + TD latent class was also associated with CpG sites located on ARID1B, NOTCH1, SERTAD4, and SIN3B, while additional epigenome-wide significant associations with CoD + TD latent class were observed in ANO6 and MOV10 genes. PSU-latent class was also associated with a differentially methylated region in LDB1. We also observed shared polygenic score (PGS) associations for PSU, AD + TD, and CoD + TD latent classes (i.e., attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, anxiety, educational attainment, and schizophrenia PGS). In contrast, TD-latent class was exclusively associated with posttraumatic stress disorder-PGS. Other specific associations were observed for PSU-latent class (subjective wellbeing-PGS and neuroticism-PGS) and AD + TD-latent class (bipolar disorder-PGS). In conclusion, we identified shared and unique genetic and epigenetic mechanisms underlying SD comorbidity patterns. These findings highlight the importance of modeling the co-occurrence of SD diagnoses when investigating the molecular basis of addiction-related traits.",,,renato.polimanti@yale.edu.

Novel immunotherapeutic strategies for this patient population are urgently needed. We tested a novel, fully human anti-CD22/4-1BB CAR T-cell construct, CART22-65s, in parallel phase I studies for pediatric and adult B-ALL. After lymphodepletion, CART22-65s was infused using a 3-day fractionated dosing scheme, allowing for omission of the second and third doses in cases of early cytokine release syndrome (CRS). Twenty-two patients, all with relapse after prior CD19-directed immunotherapy, were enrolled. Of 19 infused patients (pediatric, n=17; adult, n=2), 14 (74%) achieved a complete remission (CR), including 4 of 6 (67%) patients refractory to prior inotuzumab. Five of 14 patients in a CR proceeded to consolidative hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). With a median follow-up of 38 months, the 12-month relapse-free survival rate was 38.4% (95% CI 19.3% to 76.5%) and overall survival rate was 52.6% (95% CI 34.3% to 80.6%). Two patients received additional CART22-65s treatments for subsequent CD22-positive relapses; one achieved another CR. All CRS (n=17, 89%) and neurotoxicity (n=4, 21%) events after initial infusion were grades 1-2. The only grade 3 CRS/neurotoxicity and the only high-grade immune effector cell-associated hemophagocytic lymphohistocytosis-like syndrome occurred in the retreatment setting. In vivo cellular kinetic data revealed robust CART22-65s proliferation by quantitative PCR peaking at a median of 20 days postinfusion, with the cells persisting out to month 42 in one patient who achieved a long-term remission with CART22-65s alone. The favorable safety profile and high remission rates in exceedingly refractory B-ALL support the continued development of CART22-65s but also highlight the need to use the product in combination with HCT or other novel strategies.

Child & adolescent health,10.1016/S2352-4642(25)00040-9,"Despite progress in reducing neonatal and child mortality, access to age-appropriate medicines remains inequitable, particularly in low-income and middle-income countries. The Global Accelerator for Paediatric Formulations (GAP-f), a WHO-hosted network established in 2020, addresses these gaps by uniting 33 partners to promote innovation and access to child-friendly formulations. Phase 2 (2022-24) of GAP-f's work focused on therapeutic areas where innovation and access efforts often did not have stakeholder alignment and coordination of designing and implementing innovative clinical trial methodology, engaging with regulators to address systemic barriers, identifying novel technologies for safe and effective delivery, and collaborating across stakeholders for product roll out. Learnings from GAP-f work include the need to adapt prioritisation processes to diverse therapeutic areas and focus on high-impact areas based on unmet needs. Platform trials emerged as a promising tool to accelerate evidence generation but require guidance from regulators, collaboration among pharmaceutical companies, and operational challenges and funding constraints to be overcome. Incentivising paediatric formulation development remains crucial for small volume paediatric markets, and efforts are also needed to more proactively enhance, accelerate, and effectively match innovations to deliver medicines to children more efficiently. Even when products are successfully developed, political will and community engagement are essential to creating demand, supporting roll out, and ensuring equitable access and appropriate use in children. Dedicated funding and targeted programmes are crucial to drive systemic and sustainable change.

We used the 2016-2019 US Nationwide Readmissions Database, a nationally representative dataset of readmissions, to examine 90-day readmission outcomes after primary nonelective THA with a primary diagnosis of hip fracture. Sex and medical comorbidity (Deyo-Charlson Comorbidity Index) were variables of interest. We adjusted for demographics (age), social determinants of health (income, region, insurance payer), and hospital characteristics (control, location/teaching status, bed size). We calculated adjusted odds ratio (aOR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) in multivariable-adjusted logistic regression analyses. Of the 346,030 nonelective primary THAs for hip fracture performed in the United States, 61,443 (17.8%) had a 90-day readmission. For readmitted patients, the mean age was 80.2 years (SD, 9.6), 62.0% were women, and 90.6% had Medicare payer. In multivariable-adjusted analysis, compared with men, women had a lower aOR of 0.75 (95% CI, 0.73-0.77; p < 0.001) for 90-day readmission and lower aOR of 0.76 (95% CI, 0.69-0.84; p < 0.001) of in-hospital mortality during readmission, after nonelective primary THA for hip fracture.

However, its immunomodulatory effects in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) remain poorly understood. This study aimed to investigate the anti-tumor potential of HSJZ in NSCLC and elucidate its mechanisms of action. In vitro studies assessed HSJZ cytotoxicity in 4 tumor cell lines and its ability to activate immune cells from NSCLC patients, followed by evaluating the cytotoxicity of these activated immune cells against NSCLC cell lines. An orthotopic lung cancer model in mice evaluated in vivo anti-tumor activity. Flow cytometry, immunohistochemistry, and Western blot analysis were conducted to analyze immune cell populations, cytokine production, and protein expression levels, including Tregs, CD8 While HSJZ alone exhibited no direct cytotoxicity on NSCLC cells in vitro, it significantly enhanced immune cell-mediated killing when co-cultured with patient-derived peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), accompanied with increased IFN-γ and TNF-α production. In vivo, HSJZ (1 g/kg) treatment in a murine orthotopic lung cancer model resulted in a 54.2 % reduction in tumor burden, as assessed by IVIS spectrum imaging. Mechanistically, HSJZ suppressed regulatory T cells (Tregs) both in vivo and in vitro, as demonstrated by decreased Treg frequency and downregulation of phosphorylated PI3K/AKT signaling in mice bearing Lewis tumor. Moreover, HSJZ significantly inhibited the expression of EZH2, an epigenetic regulator crucial for Treg differentiation. These findings provide compelling evidence that HSJZ exerts anti-tumor effects in NSCLC by modulating the immune microenvironment, particularly through the inhibition of Tregs activity, as assessed by in vitro co-culture system, in vivo mouse orthotopic Lewis cancer model, immunohistochemistry, etc. Our results support the potential clinical application of HSJZ as an adjunct therapy for NSCLC patients.",,,kewangluo@126.com.

However, there is overwhelming evidence that the quality of reporting is not optimal. The CONSORT (Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials) statement was designed to improve the quality of reporting and provides a minimum set of items to be included in a report of a randomised trial. CONSORT was first published in 1996, then updated in 2001 and 2010. Here, we present the updated CONSORT 2025 statement, which aims to account for recent methodological advancements and feedback from end users. We conducted a scoping review of the literature and developed a project-specific database of empirical and theoretical evidence related to CONSORT, to generate a list of potential changes to the checklist. The list was enriched with recommendations provided by the lead authors of existing CONSORT extensions (Harms, Outcomes, Non-pharmacological Treatment), other related reporting guidelines (TIDieR) and recommendations from other sources (eg, personal communications). The list of potential changes to the checklist was assessed in a large, international, online, three-round Delphi survey involving 317 participants and discussed at a two-day online expert consensus meeting of 30 invited international experts. We have made substantive changes to the CONSORT checklist. We added seven new checklist items, revised three items, deleted one item, and integrated several items from key CONSORT extensions. We also restructured the CONSORT checklist, with a new section on open science. The CONSORT 2025 statement consists of a 30-item checklist of essential items that should be included when reporting the results of a randomised trial and a diagram for documenting the flow of participants through the trial. To facilitate implementation of CONSORT 2025, we have also developed an expanded version of the CONSORT 2025 checklist, with bullet points eliciting critical elements of each item.

To map and compare national healthcare set-ups for prescription, start, switch, tapering, and discontinuation of biologic/targeted synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) in patients with psoriatic arthritis and axial spondyloarthritis across Europe, and assess the healthcare set-ups in relation to countries' socio-economic status. An electronic survey was developed to collect and compare information on national healthcare systems. The relationship between the cumulative score of biologic/targeted synthetic DMARD regulations, socioeconomic indices, and biologic originator costs were assessed by linear regression. National healthcare set-ups differed considerably across the 15 countries, with significantly fewer regulations with increasing socioeconomic status measured by GDP/current health expenditure/human development index, and with increasing biologic originator costs. In most countries, the biologic/targeted synthetic DMARD prescribing doctor was required to adhere to country and/or hospital recommendations, and about a third of countries had a national/regional tender process. Prescription regulations for biologic/targeted synthetic DMARDs, including pre-treatment and disease activity requirements, varied substantially. Approximately a third of countries had criteria for discontinuation and tapering, whereas only few had for switching. Notably, two countries disallowed biologic/targeted synthetic DMARD retrials, and one imposed limit on the maximum number of biologic/targeted synthetic DMARDs permitted. The findings highlight substantial variability in healthcare set-ups for biologic/targeted synthetic DMARD use in psoriatic arthritis and axial spondyloarthritis across Europe and their association with socioeconomic status and drug costs.

40244291,Do Nitrosative Stress Molecules Hold Promise as Biomarkers for Multiple Sclerosis?,2025-04-17,International journal of molecular sciences,10.3390/ijms26073412,"Multiple sclerosis (MS), an auto-immune disease of the central nervous system (CNS) with inflammatory and neurodegenerative properties, remains an insufficiently understood disease despite more than 150 years of research. In contrast to diseases from other medical fields such as, for instance, oncology, a description of its clinical and non-clinical features based on readouts such as biomarkers is still in its infancy. While, in this regard, neurofilament light chain (NfL) seems to be a promising new tool, the significant intra- and interindividual variation of this serological marker somewhat limits its widespread applicability in everyday clinical reality. This has sparked novel studies in which glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) was proposed as an on-top marker serving to improve overall specificity. In this context, it was found that MS disease progression was significantly more often associated with increased levels of both NfL and GFAP compared to increased NfL levels alone. This highlights the complexity of the disease while also emphasizing the potential benefits of introducing additional markers to enhance current options. We propose that nitrosative stress markers, such as nitrate, nitrite, and nitrotyrosine (3NT), could serve this purpose effectively.",,,
40243502,Immune Modulation and Immunotherapy in Solid Tumors: Mechanisms of Resistance and Potential Therapeutic Strategies.,2025-04-17,International journal of molecular sciences,10.3390/ijms26072923,"Understanding the modulation of specific immune cells within the tumor microenvironment (TME) offers new hope in cancer treatments, especially in cancer immunotherapies. In recent years, immune modulation and resistance to immunotherapy have become critical challenges in cancer treatments. However, novel strategies for immune modulation have emerged as promising approaches for oncology due to the vital roles of the immunomodulators in regulating tumor progression and metastasis and modulating immunological responses to standard of care in cancer treatments. With the progress in immuno-oncology, a growing number of novel immunomodulators and mechanisms are being uncovered, offering the potential for enhanced clinical immunotherapy in the near future. Thus, gaining a comprehensive understanding of the broader context is essential. Herein, we particularly summarize the paradoxical role of tumor-related immune cells, focusing on how targeted immune cells and their actions are modulated by immunotherapies to overcome immunotherapeutic resistance in tumor cells. We also highlight the molecular mechanisms employed by tumors to evade the long-term effects of immunotherapeutic agents, rendering them ineffective.",,,

The association is assumed to be bi-directional. Psychological treatment is expected to improve quality of life (QoL), psychological issues and, possibly, disease activity. Many trials have tested various psychotherapy approaches, often in combination with educational modules or relaxation techniques, with inconsistent results. To assess the effects of psychological interventions on quality of life, emotional state and disease activity in persons of any age with IBD. We searched Web of Science Core Collection, KCI-Korean Journal Database, Russian Science Citation Index, MEDLINE, Psyndex, PsycINFO, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and LILACS from inception to May 2023. We also searched trial registries and major gastroenterological and selected other IBD-related conferences from 2019 until 2023. Randomized controlled trials of psychological interventions in children or adults with IBD compared to no therapy, sham (i.e. simulated intervention), or other active treatment, with a minimum follow-up time of two months, were eligible for inclusion, irrespective of publication status and language of publication. Interventions included psychotherapy and other non-pharmacological interventions addressing cognitive or emotional processing, patient education, or relaxation techniques to improve individual health status. Two raters independently extracted data and assessed the study quality using the Risk of Bias 2 Tool. Pooled standardized mean differences (SMD) for continuous outcomes and relative risks (RR) for event data were calculated with 95% confidence intervals (CI), based on separate random-effects models by age group, type of therapy and type of control. An SMD of 0.2 was considered a minimally relevant difference. SMD ≥ 0.4 was considered a moderate effect. Group analyses were planned to examine differential effects by type of IBD, disease activity, psychological comorbidity, therapy subtype, and treatment intensity. Statistical heterogeneity was determined by calculating the I Sixty-eight studies were eligible. Of these, 48 had results reported in sufficient detail for inclusion in the meta-analyses (6111 adults, 294 children and adolescents). Two trials were excluded from the meta-analysis following sensitivity analysis and tests for asymmetry because of implausible results. Most studies used multimodular approaches. The risk of bias was moderate for most outcomes, and high for some. The most common problems in individual trials were the inability to blind participants and investigators and outcome measures susceptible to measurement bias. The main issues leading to downgrading of the certainty of the evidence were heterogeneity of results, low precision and high or moderate risk of bias in the included trials. Publication bias could not be shown for any of the inspected analyses. In adults, psychotherapy was slightly more effective than care-as-usual (CAU) in improving short-term QoL (SMD 0.23, 95% CI 0.12 to 0.34; I Psychological interventions in adults are likely to improve the quality of life, depression and anxiety slightly. Psychotherapy is probably also effective for improving the quality of life in children and adolescents. The evidence suggests that psychological interventions may have little to no effect on disease activity. The interpretation of these results presents a challenge due to the clinical heterogeneity of the included trials, particularly concerning the type and various components of the common multimodular interventions.

The exercise method that combines a conventional cycle ergometer with HTS (HERG) adds additional exercise intensity to the conventional cycle ergometer through electrical stimulation. Exercise-induced brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) production appears to have neuroprotective effects and contributes to improved metabolic regulation. Changes in BDNF after exercise are related to exercise intensity. Therefore, combining a cycle ergometer with electrical stimulation may be an effective approach. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of the HERG on BDNF secretion. Fourteen healthy adults participated in the study. The participants performed two types of exercise at the anaerobic threshold: HERG and a cycling ergometer alone (CERG). A comparative study using a 2×2 crossover method was conducted to examine the differences in BDNF and lactate levels after HERG and CERG. A linear mixed model was used to compare changes in BDNF between HERG and CERG. Both HERG and CERG significantly increased BDNF and lactate levels after exercise. In overweight individuals with a BMI of 25 or higher, the change in BDNF levels after HERG was significantly greater than after CERG [ΔBDNF: 5500.96±7965.83 ng/ml, 1921.29±5308.22 ng/ml, respectively; p=0.0339]. There was no significant difference in the change in lactate levels after exercise between HERG and CERG (p=0.8632). In overweight individuals, HERG increased post-exercise serum BDNF levels more than ergometer exercise alone, despite the exercise intensity remaining the same at the anaerobic threshold. The exercise method that combines the HERG may be a useful form of exercise for overweight individuals.",,,

This study investigates the critical issue of predicting 72-hour fatality in patients with severe hyperphosphatemia (≥ 10 mg/dL). We analyzed data from 530 patients treated at the Saitama Medical Center, Japan, from 2004 to 2019, including 153 72-hour fatalities. Multivariate logistic regression analysis (MLRA), Prediction One™ (Sony Network Communications Inc., Tokyo, Japan, https://predictionone.sony.biz/), and Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM) were used to predict fatalities. These methods were evaluated on a validation set of 331 patients from 2020 to 2023, including 104 fatalities. Calibration plots for training and validation data were used for comparison. The fatality rate was 28.9% in the training data and 31.4% in the validation data. MLRA identified five fatality factors: age, low albumin, high aspartate aminotransferase, and elevated potassium and magnesium levels, with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.848 (95% CI: 0.801, 0.890), sensitivity of 0.862, and specificity of 0.704. Prediction One™ achieved an AUC of 0.770 (95% CI: 0.722, 0.818), sensitivity of 0.654, and specificity of 0.769. LightGBM achieved an AUC of 0.948 (95% CI: 0.923, 0.973), sensitivity of 0.863, and specificity of 0.889. The validation calibration plot showed that MLRA had the closest regression coefficient to 1.0 at 0.903. Although MLRA was the most accurate in predicting 72-hour fatalities, machine learning methods provided valuable insights into the importance of variables. Considering the high mortality rates associated with severe hyperphosphatemia, timely and accurate prognostication is essential in guiding immediate interventions and improving outcomes in emergency settings.",,,

We need reliable evidence on the real-world safety of these treatments to inform decision making for clinicians, patients, and caregivers. Using lecanemab as an exemplar, we outline the key considerations in designing and implementing an observational study on safety and utilization outcomes using established administrative healthcare claims data sources with the target trial emulation framework. The target trial emulation framework is a rigorous causal inference framework that minimizes common biases in observational studies. The approach proposed here can be applied to evaluation of additional mAbs as they become available.

Americas,10.1016/j.lana.2025.101082,"Observational epidemiological studies in Mexico have shown high mortality risks associated with type 2 diabetes (T2D). However, it is unclear whether these relationships are wholly causal. We aimed to assess the association of genetically-predicted T2D liability with risk of death in Mexico. Between 1998 and 2004, 150,000 men and women were recruited from Mexico City and followed-up until September 2022 for cause-specific mortality. Mendelian randomisation analyses, using a genetic risk score (GRS) comprising 1055 established T2D-associated risk variants, estimated associations with risk of all-cause and cause-specific mortality at ages 35-74. Among 121,433 included participants with a mean (standard deviation) age of 51 (11), 68% (n = 82,249) were women and 18% (n = 21,371) had T2D. The GRS explained 6.3% of T2D liability and was not associated with major potential confounders of the T2D-mortality relationship. During a median (interquartile range) of 20.2 (19.4-21.4) years' follow-up, 12,293 participants died. Genetically-predicted T2D liability was associated with a death rate ratio (RR) of 1.29 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.23-1.36) per trebling in genetically-predicted odds of T2D. There were particularly strong associations with death from renal disease (n = 1696; RR 2.29 [95% CI 1.99-2.64]) and acute diabetic crises (n = 509; RR 2.27 [1.75-2.93]) and weaker, but still strong, associations with death from vascular disease (n = 3226; RR 1.31 [1.19-1.46]) and infection (n = 2437; RR 1.21 [1.07-1.36]). Genetically-predicted T2D liability was not clearly associated with death from cancer (n = 2016; RR 1.00 [95% CI 0.88-1.14]) or cirrhosis (n = 895; RR 0.90 [0.74-1.10]).

After an initial seroprevalence study in April 2020, a follow-up study in November 2020 showed persistence of high levels of seropositivity. The impacts of SARS-CoV-2 infections and non-pharmaceutical interventions required to reduce transmission were wide-ranging, including worsened mental and physical health and economic damage. We analysed data from the Ischgl follow-up study. Of the 1,259 adults that participated in the Ischgl-1 study (Ischgl-1), 801 were followed-up. Seropositivity was defined using presence of binding and neutralizing antibodies at Ischgl-1. At follow-up, 7 months later (Ischgl-2), participants reported changes to self-rated mental and physical health, physical activity, alcohol consumption, smoking and economic status. Changes were compared by serological status, using multivariable logistic and multinomial regression models, where appropriate, and adjusting for factors including age, sex, and morbidity. 1 in 2 participants reported experiencing a moderate or severe impact of the pandemic. One fifth of participants reported a worsening in their mental health from November 2019 to November 2020; women and participants aged ≥35 to <70 years were disproportionately affected. Seropositivity was associated with a decline in physical health but no decline in mental health or behaviour changes. Very few participants reported any changes in behaviours. The overriding impact the population of Ischgl was economic-50% of participants reported a worsening of their professional and/or financial situation. Declines in self-reported mental health were associated with the overall experience of the pandemic and economic factors. The population of Ischgl demonstrated a high level of resilience to the pandemic as measured by health. However, certain segments of the population were disproportionately affected, particularly with regard to mental health and economic wellbeing. Future pandemic preparedness must consider how pandemic mitigation strategies can be responsive to context and the wider impacts on mental health and social and economic wellbeing while minimising mortality and safeguarding health systems.",Bouanchaud P; Walser A,Walser's Surgery; Population Services International,

Recently, the usefulness of ultrasound (US) examinations in the musculoskeletal assessment of PWH has been reported, but the actual use of US has been suggested to be limited. The aim of this study was to clarify the extent to which US is being performed on young male PWH at medical institutions in Japan. This was an observational study using the National Database of Health Insurance Claims and Specific Health Checkups of Japan. We identified almost all male PWH aged under 30 years who were prescribed hemostatic agents between 2015 and 2021 in Japan. For each year, we calculated the proportion of PWH who underwent US and, as a sensitivity analysis, the proportion of PWH who underwent US examinations for musculoskeletal disease. The Cochran‒Armitage trend test was used to examine changes in the number of PWH who underwent US examinations over the observation period. The Lorenz curves and Gini coefficients were calculated from the proportion of US examinations performed at each medical institution annually. A total of 2137-2483 male PWH younger than 30 years were identified annually. The annual proportion of PWH who underwent US ranged from 6.1 to 12.9%. By age group, the annual proportions of US were 6.7-14.4%, 8.1-16.6%, and 2.0-8.7% for 0-9, 10-19, and 20-29 years, respectively. The annual proportions of musculoskeletal US were 2.9-7.7%. The proportion of PWH who underwent US increased significantly over the seven-year period; however, it varied by medical institution (Gini coefficients 0.85-0.92). The use of US for young PWH is becoming more widespread in Japan. However, US is performed at different rates among medical institutions.",,,noda@naramed-u.ac.jp.

Nicotine increases blood pressure (BP) acutely, but the long-term effects of quitting the regular use of snus pouches are unknown. The aim was to evaluate the effects of snus cessation on home BP and markers of the metabolic syndrome. Volunteers aged 18-70 years using snus daily were invited to abruptly end their snus intake and followed using home BP and metabolic measurements before and for 12 weeks after cessation. Fifty volunteers were recruited. Of these, 46 (92%) attempted snus cessation and 37 (74%) did not use snus for at least 3 weeks and were included in the study. Of those included, 33 maintained snus cessation for all 12 weeks. The mean age was 38 (± 10) years and 24 (65%) were men. At week 12, the mean changes in systolic home BP was 3.7 (95% CI 1.5-5.9) mmHg, in body weight was 1.8 (95% CI 1.1-2.4) kg, and in HbA1c was 0.7 (95% CI 0.0-1.6) mmol/mol. Cessation of tobacco and nicotine pouches in individuals who regularly used snus negatively impacted systolic home BP, body weight and HbA1c after 12 weeks. Whether these effects would be reversed by snus re-initiation cannot be determined by this study, but our novel findings suggest that successful cessation of regular snus usage does not immediate improve these cardiovascular risk factors. We call for further research to confirm our findings and evaluate the effects over longer time frames. NCT06019910, https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06019910 .",,,fredrik.h.nystrom@liu.se.

In patients with cancer, however, recurrent VTE after DOAC treatment may be more common than in noncancer patients. To evaluate our hypothesis that the anticoagulation effect of edoxaban is lower in VTE patients with cancer than in noncancer patients. This study was a prospective, multicenter, observational study including patients treated with edoxaban for VTE in Japan. The primary outcome was the difference in the prothrombin time (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), and D-dimer level at 5 h after initial edoxaban administration between the cancer and noncancer groups. An additional outcome was the longitudinal change in PT and APTT from 5 h to overnight after edoxaban administration. The incidence of adverse events was further investigated. PT and APTT at 5 h after initial edoxaban administration were not significantly different between the cancer (n = 84) and noncancer groups (n = 138) (e.g., log-transformed APTT 3.55 vs. 3.55, p = 0.45). However, D-dimer in the cancer groups was significantly greater than that in the noncancer groups (log-transformed 1.83 vs. 1.79, p = 0.009). PT and APTT significantly decreased from 5 h to overnight after edoxaban, but a similar pattern was observed in each group. All adverse events after edoxaban administration were also similar between patients with cancer and noncancer. PT and APTT after edoxaban administration were similar between VTE patients with cancer and noncancer groups, suggesting that edoxaban has anticoagulation effects on cancer-associated VTE similar to those of noncancer patients.

However, the lack of consensus on the specific information to include, on and clinicians' preferences, hinders the adoption of these imaging analysis tools. This study aims to facilitate the clinical implementation of QReports by determining clinicians' requirements regarding their use in MS management. A four-phase Delphi panel approach was employed, involving neurologists and (neuro)radiologists across Europe. Initial interviews with experts helped develop a questionnaire addressing various QReport aspects. This questionnaire underwent refinement based on feedback and was distributed through the MAGNIMS network. A second questionnaire, incorporating additional questions, was circulated following a plenary discussion at the MAGNIMS workshop in Milan in November 2023. Responses from both questionnaire iterations were collected and analyzed, with adjustments made based on participant feedback. The study achieved a 49.6% response rate, involving 78 respondents. Key preferences and barriers to QReport adoption were identified, highlighting the importance of integration into clinical workflows, cost-effectiveness, educational support for interpretation, and validation standards. Strong consensus emerged on including detailed lesion information and specific brain and spinal cord volume measurements. Concerns regarding report generation time, data protection, and reliability were also raised. While QReports show potential for improving MS management, incorporation of the key metrics and addressing the identified barriers related to cost, validation, integration, and clinician education is crucial for practical implementation.

However, little is known about the contribution of bronchial arteries to lung perfusion in CF. We hypothesized that delayed perfusion can be detected by dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE-)MRI and that bronchial artery dilatation (BAD) is associated with changes in lung perfusion. Morpho-functional MRI was prospectively acquired in 75 patients with CF (18.7 ± 7.6 years, range 6-39 years). Lungs and perfusion defects were segmented automatically to quantify perfusion defects in percent (QDP). Pulmonary blood flow (PBF), mean transit time (MTT), and perfusion delay were calculated for the whole lung, inside normally perfused and perfusion defect areas. Chest MRI score and BAD were assessed visually. QDP and PBF correlated with MRI global score (r = 0.58 and -0.53, p < 0.001). In normally perfused lung, PBF was higher (161.2 ± 77.9 mL/100 mL/min vs. 57.5 ± 26.4 mL/100 mL/min, p < 0.001), and MTT (5.4 ± 1.7 s vs. 6.9 ± 2.3 s, p < 0.001) and perfusion delay were shorter than in perfusion defect areas (4.6 ± 5.3 s vs. 13.4 ± 16.2 s, p < 0.001). 48 (64.0%) patients showed BAD, had higher QDP (44.6 ± 20.8% vs. 17.3 ± 11.0%, p < 0.001) and lower PBF (91.9 ± 54.8 mL/100 mL/min vs. 178.3 ± 77.4 mL/100 mL/min, p < 0.001) than patients without BAD. MTT was shorter (6.3 ± 1.9 s vs. 8.0 ± 2.6 s, p < 0.001), and perfusion delay was longer (13.8 ± 10.1 s vs. 12.8 ± 23.7 s, p < 0.02) inside perfusion defects of patients with BAD compared to without BAD. Perfusion parameters correlate with lung disease severity, and perfusion defects showed delayed perfusion in patients with CF. BAD was associated with more extensive perfusion defects and reduced PBF. Question Dilated bronchial arteries are a common comorbidity in cystic fibrosis (CF), which can cause hemoptysis, but their quantitative contribution to lung perfusion is little researched. Findings Perfusion defects in percent (QDP) enabled objective assessment of perfusion abnormalities in CF patients, while perfusion delay and arterial correlation showed bronchial artery perfusion contribution. Clinical relevance The usage of quantitative perfusion metrics in CF may help tracking disease progression. By also including the proposed metrics perfusion delay and arterial correlation, bronchial artery inflow could be assessed and used to detect early onset of bronchial artery dilation.",Graeber SY; Stahl M; Mall MA,Department of Pediatric Respiratory Medicine,mark.wielpuetz@med.uni-greifswald.de.

In addition to undergoing broad intracellular molecular and metabolic adaptations, hypoxic tumor cells extensively communicate with their microenvironments to facilitate conditions favorable for their survival, growth, and metastasis. This communication is mediated by diverse secretory factors, including exosomes (extracellular vesicles of endosomal origin). Exosomal cargo is altered considerably by hypoxia, with significant impacts on tumor-cell communication with both local and distant microenvironments. Exosomes released by cancer cells influence the tumor environment to accelerate metastasis. While tumor-derived exosomes have been identified as a major driver of premetastatic niche formation at distant sites, this mechanism in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) remains unclear. We found that miR-671-3p in exosomes derived from H1975 under hypoxic conditions target Krüppel-like factor 2 (KLF2) to regulate VEGFR2 expression in endothelial cells to promote angiogenesis. In addition, miR-671-3p is expressed at high levels in circulating exosomes isolated from patients with LUAD. Our study suggests that exosome miR-671-3p is involved in the formation of premetastatic niche and may serve as a blood-based biomarker for LUAD metastasis.",Song F,Jilin Connell Pharmaceutical Company,wangyi@jlu.edu.cn.

The objective is to highlight unmet scientific needs in the field of rheumatology. The 24th annual Advances in Targeted Therapies meeting convened with more than 100 international clinicians and scientific researchers in rheumatology, immunology, and other specialities relating to all aspects of immune-mediated inflammatory diseases. During the meeting, we held 5 rheumatologic disease-specific discussion sections consisting of experts in each field. These groups included rheumatoid arthritis (RA), psoriatic arthritis (PsA), axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA), osteoarthritis (OA), and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). In each group, experts were asked to identify the top 2 to 3 most important overarching and disease-specific scientific unmet needs to be addressed in the next 5 years. The overarching themes across disciplines included the need for precision medicine, improved classification of disease states, and the further identification of targets and associated therapies, including the potential role of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapies. Within RA, the group highlighted the lack of precision medicine and the need for better biomarkers. Further, the lack of targeted therapies against fibroblasts in RA was discussed, with the potential impact of targeting fibroblasts early in the disease as an unmet need. For PsA, there is a continued need for a better definition of disease endotypes and for the categorisation of those with complex and difficult-to-treat (D2T) diseases. The development of bispecific molecules and combination therapeutic approaches remain a high priority. For axSpA, the disease-modifying characteristics of nonsteroid anti-inflammatory drugs need further evaluation, as does the treatment of residual pain and fatigue frequently in the disease. In OA, new therapeutic targets remain an unmet need, and the discussion group prioritised potential experimental strategies that could lead to innovative therapeutic targets. Elucidating the specific signalling and target cells responsible for, or inhibiting, repair will be essential for developing targeted therapies. SLE experts emphasised the need to identify the most predictive biological contributions to disease progression in patients with early clinical precursors of SLE. The role of CAR T cell therapy must be further investigated, along with ancillary biologic studies (eg, immune system profiling) that provide critical insights into disease pathogenesis. Further, there is a need to determine the relationship of patient-relevant symptoms to the pathophysiology of SLE and identify new therapeutic targets for these symptoms. There remain many unmet needs on the road to precision medicine with regard to identifying disease endotypes and biomarkers for disease progression or therapeutic response. For most diseases discussed, a strong unmet need remains with regard to identifying new targets and therapies for those with refractory or D2T disease. The ability to prevent or cure rheumatic disease remains the ultimate unmet need in rheumatology.",Gottenberg JE; Baraliakos X,Centre National de Référence des Maladies AutoImmunes Systémiques Rares; Ruhr-Universität Bochum,Winthrop@ohsu.edu.
40240093,Early Ezetimibe Initiation After Myocardial Infarction Protects Against Later Cardiovascular Outcomes in the SWEDEHEART Registry.,2025-04-16,Journal of the American College of Cardiology,10.1016/j.jacc.2025.02.007,"Combination lipid-lowering therapy (LLT) after myocardial infarction (MI) achieves lower low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels and better cardiovascular outcomes vs statin monotherapy. As a result, global guidelines recommend lower LDL-C but, paradoxically, advise treatment through a stepwise approach. Yet the need for combination therapy is inevitable as <20% of patients achieve goals with statins alone. Whether combining ezetimibe with a statin early vs late after MI results in better outcomes is unknown. In this study, the authors sought to assess the impact of delayed treatment escalation on outcomes by comparing early vs late oral combination LLT (statins plus ezetimibe) in patients with MI. LLT-naïve patients (SWEDEHEART registry) hospitalized for MI (2015-2022) and discharged on statins were included. Using clone-censor-weight and Cox proportional hazards models, we compared differences in risks of MACE (death, MI, stroke), components of MACE, and cardiovascular death between patients with ezetimibe added to statins ≤12 weeks after discharge as reference (early combination therapy), from 13 weeks to 16 months (late combination therapy), or not at all. Of 35,826 patients (median age 65.1 years, 26.0% women), 6,040 (16.9%) received ezetimibe early, 6,495 (18.1%) ezetimibe late, and 23,291 (65.0%) received no ezetimibe. High-intensity statin use was ≥98% in all groups. Over a median 3.96 years (Q1-Q3: 2.15-5.81 years), 2,570 patients had MACE (440 cardiovascular deaths). One-year MACE incidences were 1.79 (early), 2.58 (late), and 4.03 (none) per 100 patient-years. Compared with early combination therapy, weighted risk differences in MACE for late combination therapy at 1, 2, and 3 years were 0.6% (95% CI: 0.1%-1.1%; P < 0.01), 1.1% (95% CI: 0.3%-2.0%; P < 0.01), and 0.7% (95% CI: -0.2% to 1.3%; P = 0.18), and 3-year HR was 1.14 (95% CI: 0.95-1.41). For those receiving no ezetimibe, risk differences were 0.7% (95% CI: 0.2%-1.3%), 1.6% (95% CI: 0.8%-2.5%), and 1.9% (95% CI: 0.8%-3.1%; P for all <0.01; 3-year HR: 1.29 [95% CI: 1.12-1.55]). Similar differences in risk of cardiovascular death at 3 years were observed (HRs vs early: late: 1.64 [95% CI: 1.15-2.63]; none: 1.83 [95% CI: 1.35-2.69]). MI care pathways should implement early combination therapy with statins and ezetimibe as standard care, because delaying use of combination LLT or using high-intensity statin monotherapy is associated with avoidable harm.",Gustafsson S; Cars T,Sence Research,margret.leosdottir@med.lu.se.

Medicine,10.1016/j.xcrm.2025.102084,"Chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) is a neurodegenerative tauopathy associated with repetitive head impact (RHI) exposure. Genetic variation in the 17q21.31 region, containing microtubule-associated protein tau (MAPT), has been implicated in tauopathies but has not been investigated in CTE. The region includes a megabase-long inversion (H1/H2) and copy-number variations, including α, β, and γ segments, which can be characterized as nine segregating structural haplotypes. We leveraged array SNP data and a reference panel across the 17q21.31 region to impute structural haplotypes and test their association with CTE endophenotypes in 447 European ancestry brain donors with RHI exposure. The H1β1γ1 haplotype was significantly associated with dementia and semi-quantitative tau burden in multiple cortical and medial temporal regions commonly affected in CTE. H1β1γ1 differential expression analyses in dorsolateral frontal cortex implicated cis-acting genes and inflammatory pathways. Taken together, the H1β1γ1 haplotype may help explain CTE heterogeneity among those with similar RHI exposure.",,,jessemez@bu.edu.

40238798,Engineering the green algae Chlamydomonas incerta for recombinant protein production.,2025-04-16,PloS one,10.1371/journal.pone.0321071,"Chlamydomonas incerta, a genetically close relative of the model green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, shows significant potential as a host for recombinant protein expression. Because of the close genetic relationship between C. incerta and C. reinhardtii, this species offers an additional reference point for advancing our understanding of photosynthetic organisms, and also provides a potential new candidate for biotechnological applications. This study investigates C. incerta's capacity to express three recombinant proteins: the fluorescent protein mCherry, the hemicellulose-degrading enzyme xylanase, and the plastic-degrading enzyme PHL7. We have also examined the capacity to target protein expression to various cellular compartments in this alga, including the cytosol, secretory pathway, cytoplasmic membrane, and cell wall. When compared directly with C. reinhardtii, C. incerta exhibited a distinct but notable capacity for recombinant protein production. Cellular transformation with a vector encoding mCherry revealed that C. incerta produced approximately 3.5 times higher fluorescence levels and a 3.7-fold increase in immunoblot intensity compared to C. reinhardtii. For xylanase expression and secretion, both C. incerta and C. reinhardtii showed similar secretion capacities and enzymatic activities, with comparable xylan degradation rates, highlighting the industrial applicability of xylanase expression in microalgae. Finally, C. incerta showed comparable PHL7 activity levels to C. reinhardtii, as demonstrated by the in vitro degradation of a polyester polyurethane suspension, Impranil® DLN. Finally, we also explored the potential of cellular fusion for the generation of genetic hybrids between C. incerta and C. reinhardtii as a means to enhance phenotypic diversity and augment genetic variation. We were able to generate genetic fusion that could exchange both the recombinant protein genes, as well as associated selectable marker genes into recombinant offspring. These findings emphasize C. incerta's potential as a robust platform for recombinant protein production, and as a powerful tool for gaining a better understanding of microalgal biology.",,,

A systematic review of full-text manuscripts published from 2013 to May 2024 was conducted using MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CINAHL. Studies describing distress screening and referral protocols were included, while systematic reviews, commentaries, non-US studies, non-English publications, and studies on distress score-disease burden associations were excluded. Attributes of distress screening and referral pathways were extracted. From an initial 1219 articles, 19 studies were included. Significant variability was observed in NCCN DT workflows, particularly in responder characteristics (e.g., cancer type, patient vs. caregiver). Nursing staff primarily administered screenings, varying by mode (paper vs. electronic), frequency, and location (home vs. clinic). A cut-off score of 4 or higher often triggered referrals, with some studies further stratifying distress levels for tailored follow-ups. Referral pathways included educational resources, behavioral and emotional health, social support, and rehabilitative and supportive care services. Caregiver distress screening was infrequent. This review underscores the variability in NCCN DT workflows and the need for customizable protocols. While standardization is desirable, some variation is essential to accommodate the differing availability of resources and personnel for effective distress screening and referral. Effective distress screening and referral pathways ensure survivors receive timely psychological, emotional, and social support, improving quality of life. Integrating caregiver distress screening into workflows could amplify overall support systems, fostering holistic survivorship care. A flexible yet structured approach enhances access to tailored interventions, promoting resilience in survivors and caregivers.",,,pagarwal@unmc.edu.
40237969,Attitudes Toward COVID-19 Vaccination and Clinical Trials Among Saudi University Students.,2025-04-16,Journal of epidemiology and global health,10.1007/s44197-025-00393-y,"The implementation of a global COVID-19 vaccination campaign has been one of the most effective interventions in controlling the pandemic. However, vaccine hesitancy remains a major public health challenge, extending to COVID-19 vaccines. This cross-sectional study aimed to assess attitudes toward COVID-19 vaccination and willingness to participate in clinical trials among Saudi university affiliates. An anonymous online questionnaire was distributed between June 2021 and June 2022 to affiliates of four major universities in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. Attitudes toward vaccination were assessed using the 12-item Vaccination Attitudes Examination (VAX) scale, while attitudes toward clinical trial participation were evaluated through statements rated on a 5-point Likert scale. Statistical analyses were conducted to determine associations between vaccine acceptance, clinical trial participation, and demographic factors. A total of 365 respondents participated in the study. The majority were healthcare students, with most in their fourth academic year. Overall, 50.4% of the study sample exhibited vaccine and clinical trial hesitancy. Females exhibited significantly higher vaccine acceptance than males (P = 0.013), though hesitancy rates were only borderline significant between genders (P = 0.063). Healthcare students had significantly higher vaccine acceptance (P < 0.0001) and greater willingness to participate in clinical trials (P < 0.0001) compared to students from science and humanities disciplines. While most participants believed in vaccine safety and effectiveness, many expressed hesitancy regarding the motivations of pharmaceutical companies. Although attitudes toward clinical trials were generally favorable, only 37.8% expressed willingness to participate, and this figure dropped to 32.9% for COVID-19 vaccine trials. Vaccine acceptors were significantly more likely to be willing to participate in clinical trials (P < 0.0001). Understanding university students' perspectives on vaccination and clinical trials can help shape targeted public health campaigns to address vaccine hesitancy. Future research is needed to explore determinants of vaccine hesitancy and barriers to clinical trial participation in this population.",,,hana.fakhoury@gmail.com.

Patients undergoing primary 1-3 level lumbar fusion at a single, tertiary care institution from 2017 to 2021 were retrospectively identified. Patient characteristics, surgical details, and surgical outcomes were collected via chart review. Medications were collected based on active medication lists at the patient's preoperative and first postoperative appointment-patients were considered to be taking antidepressants if prescriptions were active at both appointments. Inpatient physical therapy metrics including the distance walked during a single session (session distance) and Activity Measure for Post-Acute Care (AMPAC) scores were collected. Statistical analysis was performed to identify differences between the ""antidepressant"" and ""no antidepressant"" groups. 493 patients (27.7%) were taking antidepressants perioperatively. Patients in the antidepressant group were more likely to be female (p < 0.001), current smokers (p = 0.012), and have a higher Elixhauser comorbidity index (p < 0.001). On regression analysis, the antidepressant group was associated with discharge to inpatient rehabilitation after surgery (p = 0.026). Age (p < 0.001), length of stay (p < 0.001), 1st PT session distance walked (p < 0.001), and improvement in gait distance (p < 0.001) were associated with non-home discharge. Antidepressant use was independently associated with discharge to a rehabilitation facility.

To investigate the impact of cervical paraspinal muscle mass and quality on the rate of pseudarthrosis and patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) after anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF). Poor muscle quality has been shown to correlate with inferior outcomes in spine surgery. However, few studies have investigated the impact of paraspinal sarcopenia on pseudoarthrosis following cervical spine surgery. Adult patients who underwent primary, elective one-to-four level ACDF with preoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and postoperative radiographs were included. MRIs were reviewed to assess sternocleidomastoid (SCM) cross-sectional area (CSA) and Goutallier grade at the C5-C6 disc space. Pseudarthrosis was diagnosed on 1-year postoperative flexion-extension radiographs as greater than 1 millimeter of interspinous motion between each instrumented level. Patient demographic and surgical variables and 1-year patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) were compared between those with and without pseudoarthrosis on bivariate and multivariate analyses. 205 patients were included (33.7% with pseudoarthrosis). The pseudoarthrosis group had a higher percentage of patients with 4-level (7.25% vs. 1.47%) and 3-level (30.4% vs. 17.6%, P=0.01) ACDF. The groups were similar in terms of demographics, surgical variables, and SCM area normalized to BMI. After controlling for SCM CSA group, age, sex, BMI, and number of levels fused, higher Goutallier grade independently increased the odds of pseudoarthrosis (odds ratio (OR): 3.46, P=0.009). Patients with greater SCM fatty infiltration experienced greater improvement in PCS scores (P=0.023), but there were no other differences in PROM scores between groups. Although this analysis did not show an association between SCM muscle size and pseudoarthrosis, even mild fatty infiltration appears to be independently predictive of pseudoarthrosis. In contrast, PROMs were not associated with SCM size or fatty infiltration. Further work is needed to confirm these findings and explore their clinical implications.",,,

Analytical approaches must keep pace to support this surge in the development of mRNA-based therapies. Intact mass analysis of mid- to large mRNA molecules (>1,000 nt) poses significant analytical challenges due to mRNA size, heterogeneity, and instability. Here, we demonstrate how single-particle Orbitrap-based charge detection mass spectrometry (CDMS) and mass photometry (MP) approaches can rapidly measure the mass of various intact high-mass capped mRNAs, up to 9,400 nt (∼3 MDa) in size. While ensemble MS yielded approximate masses for mRNAs <2,000 nt, it failed to provide information on samples of longer sequences. The drawbacks of ensemble MS could be avoided by recording individual ions. Low-charge mRNA components showed unstable ion behavior, hampering initial CDMS measurements, whereas high-charge populations offered better signal-to-noise and reduced charge uncertainty, with drastically improved mass accuracy. Lastly, in-solution MP enabled the measurement of mRNAs with high accuracy, while revealing low amounts of mRNA fragments and dimers that are sometimes overlooked in CDMS. Overall, CDMS and MP provide complementary methods that enable the study of large heterogeneous mRNA without requiring prior digestion or online separation.",Barnes LF; Powers TW; Friese OV,BioTherapeutics Pharmaceutical Sciences,

However, whether caplacizumab reduces mortality, and its optimal timing of initiation, is not completely settled. This international, multicenter retrospective cohort study recruited patients from 2018 until 2023 and data collection took place from January 1st to June 30th 2023 in the participating centers. One thousand and fifteen patients were treated with daily TPE, immunosuppression with corticosteroids ± rituximab, and caplacizumab (caplacizumab group), which was compared to historic controls treated with TPE and corticosteroids ± rituximab (control group, N = 510). Caplacizumab initiation was classified as early (within 3 days; 76% of cases) or delayed (≥4 days from first TPE). Three-month survival rate in the caplacizumab group was 98.5%, compared with 94% in controls (P < 0.0001). Three-month mortality rate was 4.2-fold higher in controls than in caplacizumab-treated patients (95% CI: 2.22-7.7, P < 0.0001), regardless of rituximab use. In both groups, death was observed primarily in elderly patients, and age was the factor most associated with 3-month mortality. Patients receiving caplacizumab showed reduced refractoriness, exacerbations, and required fewer TPE sessions to achieve clinical response versus controls (P < 0.0001 all). Time to clinical response in the caplacizumab group was shorter than in controls, and even shorter in patients with early caplacizumab initiation (P < 0.0001 both). Caplacizumab-related adverse events were observed in 21% of patients, with major bleeding in 2.4%, which was more common in elderly patients. The early association of Caplacizumab to TPE and immunosuppression significantly reduces unfavorable outcomes during iTTP, including death, and alleviates the burden of care at the potential expense of bleeding events. Advanced age, however, remains an adverse factor for survival. The limitations of our study include its retrospective and multicentric design and the use of a historical control cohort.

This study created a strategy to assess choroidal thinning through the video analysis of facial skin. Videos capturing the entire facial skin were collected from 48 participants with age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and 12 healthy individuals. These facial videos were analyzed using video-based trans-angiosomes imaging photoplethysmography (TaiPPG) to generate facial imaging biomarkers that were correlated with choroidal thickness (CT) measurements. The CT of all patients was determined using swept-source optical coherence tomography (SS-OCT). The results revealed the relationship between relative blood pulsation amplitude (BPA) in three typical facial angiosomes (cheek, side-forehead, and mid-forehead) and the average macular CT (r=0.48, P<0.001; r=-0.56, P<0.001; r=-0.40, P<0.01). When considering a diagnostic threshold of 200 µm for CT, the newly developed facial video analysis tool effectively distinguished between cases of choroidal thinning and normal cases, yielding areas under the curve of 0.75, 0.79, and 0.69. These findings shed light on the connection between choroidal blood flow and facial skin hemodynamics, which suggests the potential for predicting vascular diseases through widely accessible skin imaging data.",,,

Omalizumab (OMA) used as monotherapy or in conjunction with oral immunotherapy (OIT) has been suggested as an efficacious treatment for severe food allergy. The aim of this study was to analyze real-world data from food-allergic patients treated with OMA. We included food-allergic patients treated with OMA between 2002 and 2022 throughout Europe. Treatment responders (TR) were identified based on the unresponsiveness to related food allergens (determined by food challenge), reduction in the severity of food allergy and absence of anaphylactic reactions. Sixty-two patients (female n = 39/62, 62.9%; mean age 30.6 years) were included into this analysis, most of whom were polysensitized to more than 2 food allergens (n = 40/62, 64.5%); 45/62 patients (72.6%) received OMA in conjunction with OIT, while the remaining patients underwent OMA monotherapy. The eliciting food allergens were tree nuts (n = 27/62, 43.5%), cow's milk (n = 26/62, 41.9%), and vegetables (n = 25/62, 40.3%). In most cases, OMA was initiated with 300 mg q4w (n = 51/62, 82.3%) dosing. Treatment was tolerated exceptionally well.Fifty-two (52/62) patients (83.9%) were classified as treatment responders. Six (6/62) patients (9.7%) developed unresponsiveness, 6/62 (9.7%) had a reduction of the severity of food allergy, and 40/62 (64.5%) had no further anaphylactic reactions during treatment. One (1/62) patient (1.6%) undergoing monotherapy was a non-responder, exhibiting repeated anaphylactic reactions to accidental exposures, and 10/62 patients (16.1%) reported anaphylactic reactions during treatment. In most of these cases, cofactors (n = 5/10, 50%) were present. Our real-world evidence data indicate efficacy and tolerability of OMA for the treatment of IgE-mediated food allergy with and without OIT. As the onset of food related reactions upon treatment was frequently linked to the presence of cofactors, these should be identified and considered in patients with food allergy-not only for diagnosis, but also in treatment settings.",Alexiou A; Tassinari P; Worm M,Division of Allergy and Immunology; Novartis Pharma AG,

However, studies suggest that most veterinary AEs remain unreported. Veterinary medicine regulators, including the United Kingdom Veterinary Medicines Directorate and the European Medicines Agency, have included the exploration of big data utilization to support pharmacovigilance efforts in their regulatory strategies. In this study, we describe the application of veterinary electronic healthcare records (EHRs) from the SAVSNET veterinary first opinion informatics system to conduct pharmacoepidemiological analyses. Five VMP-AE pairs were selected for investigation in a proof-of-concept study, where drug exposure was identified from semi-structured treatment data and AEs from the unstructured free-text clinical narrative. Dictionaries were developed to identify AEs based on standard terminology. The precision of these dictionaries improved when they were expanded using word vectorization and expert opinion. A key strength of first-opinion EHR datasets is their ability to enable cohort studies and facilitate calculations of absolute incidence and relative risk. Thus, we demonstrate that unstructured free-text clinical narratives can be used to identify outcomes for veterinary pharmacoepidemiological studies and, consequently, support and expand pharmacovigilance efforts based on spontaneous AE reports.",,,

This article describes the clinical and pharmacokinetic data of breastfeeding mothers using clopidogrel (CLP) as secondary prevention following (suspicion of) a cerebrovascular accident. A 29-year-old and 42-year-old woman were chronically treated with 75 mg CLP once daily. Human milk samples were collected at 7 and 9 months (patient 1), and at 14 months  The average steady-state concentration in human milk was 0.96 and 7.40 ng/mL for CLP and CCA, respectively. CAM concentrations in all but two milk samples were below the limit of detection (LOD; 0.004 ng/mL). In the infant plasma sample, CCA level was 0.05 ng/mL but CLP and CAM were undetectable (CLP LOD: 0.003 ng/mL). The mean daily infant dosage (DID) was 82.3, 585.6 and 1.5 ng/kg/day for CLP, CCA and CAM, respectively, and the relative infant dose (RID) for CLP-related exposure remained well below 1%. The estimated infant exposure to CLP and its metabolites via human milk was low in both cases. Although this low exposure was supported by the observed infant plasma concentration, additional studies should confirm CLP safety via human milk, especially considering known variable pharmacokinetics and ontogeny of metabolizing enzymes in infants.",Van Neste M; Nauwelaerts N; Mols R; Ceulemans M; Passier A; Annaert P; Allegaert K,Drug Delivery and Disposition; Clinical Pharmacology and Pharmacotherapy; Teratology Information Service,

We conducted this first-in-human, Phase I clinical trial to evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics (PK), and exploratory pharmacodynamics (PD) of CPL'116 in healthy subjects. Phase I clinical trial in healthy White volunteers was conducted after single (n = 21, 10-300 mg) and multiple (n = 32, 30-240 mg or placebo, 14-day b.i.d.) administrations of CPL'116 including a food effect study (n = 12, 120 mg). The multiple ascending dose part was double-blinded and placebo-controlled. The primary endpoint was safety evaluation, and the secondary endpoint was PK. Exploratory PD was studied by measuring the inhibition of JAK and ROCK in the blood by assessing STAT1, STAT5, and MLC phosphorylation. Safety parameters were comparable between the placebo and active treatment groups, with no clinically meaningful variations in the safety parameters between the cohorts. No deaths or serious adverse events (SAEs) were reported. No influence on hematological parameters (neutrophil count, red cell distribution width, and mean corpuscular volume) was observed. Plasma C CPL'116 was safe and well-tolerated by healthy subjects. The PK profile is well suited for twice-daily administration and justifies further clinical development. Exploratory PD studies indicated the ability of CPL'116 to affect the JAK and ROCK pathways in humans, hinting at its potential therapeutic role in diseases benefiting from its dual mode of action. The positive results of this study indicate the possibility of developing a novel class of therapeutics that address both inflammatory and fibrotic processes. clinicaltrials.gov, identifier NCT04670757.",Jarus-Dziedzic K; Rabczenko D; Segiet-Święcicka A,CleanDataLabs; Clinical Site,

The conference convened experts from regulatory agencies, industry, and academia to explore the latest advancements in DNT testing and the integration of animal-free new approach methodologies (NAMs) into next-generation risk assessment (NGRA). The key topic was the appli-cation and further development of the recently established DNT in vitro test battery (DNT-IVB). To support this, OECD held a satellite meeting to discuss necessary next steps for further implementation of the DNT-IVB in regulatory contexts. Validation of new DNT test methods and use of their data for in-vitro-to-in-vivo extrapolations in physiologically based kinetic models were also important themes of the main meeting. In this context, the question was raised when a comprehensive biological and chemical coverage by the DNT-IVB would be reached. A need for additional testing data was recognized. Context-specific validation approaches for the entire DNT-IVB and the potential for intelligent combinations of assays to enhance the predictive power of the test battery were also addressed. Many presentations demonstrated the field's embrace of novel developments, including the use of multi-endpoint embryonic zebrafish tests, the development of artificial intelligence-driven computational approaches, and the establishment of complex, electrically active brain organoids and other self-organizing structures.

However, comparing biomarker measures without standardization and appreciating their magnitude relative to the disease can be challenging. To address this issue, we propose the CentiMarker approach, similar to Centiloid, which provides a standardized scale between normal (0) and nearly maximum abnormal AD (100) ranges. We applied this scale to cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers in dominantly inherited AD and sporadic AD cohorts. CentiMarkers facilitated the interpretation of disease abnormality, demonstrating comparable changes and distributions of AD biomarkers across disease stages. CentiMarkers make the treatment effect more comparable than their original scales across various biomarkers. The versatility of CentiMarkers makes it a valuable tool for standardized biomarker comparison in AD research, enabling informed cross-study comparisons and contributing to accelerated therapeutic development. Adoption of the CentiMarker scale could enhance biomarker reporting and advance our understanding of AD. Comparing fluid biomarkers without appreciating their magnitude relative to the disease can be challenging. We propose a CentiMarker metric to standardize biomarker measures from normal (0) and nearly maximum abnormal AD (100) ranges.

Adrenaline is an important driver of this response. Anxiety correlates with circulating free fatty acid levels and can be alleviated by a peripherally restricted β-blocker, suggesting a peripheral signal linking metabolism with behaviour. Here we show that adrenaline, the β3 agonist CL316,243 and acute restraint stress induce growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF15) secretion in white adipose tissue of mice. Genetic inhibition of adipose triglyceride lipase or genetic deletion of β-adrenergic receptors blocks β-adrenergic-induced increases in GDF15. Increases in circulating GDF15 require lipolysis-induced free fatty acid stimulation of M2-like macrophages within white adipose tissue. Anxiety-like behaviour elicited by adrenaline or restraint stress is eliminated in mice lacking the GDF15 receptor GFRAL. These data provide molecular insights into the mechanisms linking metabolism and behaviour and suggest that inhibition of GDF15-GFRAL signalling might reduce acute anxiety.",,,gstein@mcmaster.ca.

PARTING is an open-label pilot trial of psilocybin-assisted psychotherapy for approximately 15 people with cancer-related PGD. It aims to investigate feasibility, safety, acceptability, participant experience and participant-reported therapeutic effects. Over a 5-week intervention period, participants will undergo three preparation sessions before receiving a psychoactive (25 mg) dose of psilocybin alongside non-directive supportive guidance, followed by four integration sessions. All sessions will be delivered by a psychologist and either a nurse or Indigenous Therapist. An artificial intelligence-assisted tool will be used to create an artwork of participants' psychedelic experience.Outcomes will be investigated over a 12-month follow-up period. Feasibility will be assessed through recruitment/retention rates and completion of follow-up assessments. Safety will be evaluated via adverse events over 12 months and the comparison of physiological measures (vital signs, biochemistry, haematology, ECG) recorded during screening and 1 day after the psilocybin dose.

The COVID-19 pandemic has heightened concerns about mental health services and cognitive stimulation opportunities. Despite evidence-based interventions like action-based cognitive remediation (ABCR) and metacognitive training (MCT), a research-to-practice gap exists in their application across mental health settings. The iCogCA study aims to address this gap by implementing digital ABCR and MCT through a national Canadian collaborative effort using digital psychological interventions to enhance cognitive health in SSDs. The study involves 5 Canadian sites, with mental health care practitioners trained digitally through the E-Cog platform, which was developed by our research group. Over 2.5 years, participants with SSDs will undergo pre- and postintervention assessments for clinical symptoms, cognition, and functioning. Each site will run groups annually for both ABCR and MCT, totaling ~390 participants. A nonrandomized concurrent controlled design will assess effectiveness design, in which one intervention (eg, ABCR) acts as the active control for the other (eg, MCT) and vice versa, comparing cognitive and clinical outcomes between the interventions using generalized linear mixed effect modeling. Implementation strategy evaluation will consider the digital platform's efficacy for mental health care practitioners' training, contextual factors influencing implementation, and sustainability, using descriptive statistics for quantitative data and thematic analysis for qualitative data. A pilot pragmatic trial has been conducted previously at the Montreal site, evaluating 3 early implementation outcomes: acceptability, feasibility, and engagement. Patient and therapist acceptability was deemed as high and feasible (21/28, 75% of recruited service users completed therapy, rated feasible by therapists). Technology did not appear to significantly impede program participation. Therapist-rated levels of engagement were also satisfactory. In the ongoing study, recruitment is underway (114 participants recruited as of winter 2024), and intervention groups have been conducted at all sites, with therapists receiving training via the E-Cog learning platform (32 enrolled as of winter 2024). At least 3 significant innovations will stem from this project. First, this national effort represents a catalyst for the use of digital technologies to increase the adoption of evidence-based interventions and will provide important results on the effectiveness of digitally delivered ABCR and MCT. Second, the results of the implementation component of this study will generate the expertise needed to inform the implementation of similar initiatives.

We divided HFpEF patients in PURSUIT-HFpEF registry into younger HFpEF group (age ≤ 65 years) and older HFpEF group and compared the all-cause mortality and HF readmission (HFR) between the two groups and identified discharge factors correlated with HFR among younger HFpEF patients. The younger HFpEF group comprised 51 patients (4.1%). In this group, body mass index and smoking were significantly higher, while hypertension was significantly lower compared to older HFpEF group. Kaplan-Meier analysis indicated no significant difference in HFR between the groups, although all-cause mortality was significantly lower in younger HFpEF group (p < 0.001). Multivariable Cox proportional hazards analysis indicated that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) or angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB) were inversely correlated with HFR, whereas mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRA) were positively correlated with HFR in younger HFpEF patients (p = 0.004 and p = 0.007, respectively). In conclusion, younger HFpEF is rare (approximately 4%), with obesity and smoking being significant modifiable factors. HFR was similar between younger and older HFpEF patients. Administration of ACEI/ARB and unnecessity of MRA at discharge may be associated with reducing HFR in younger HFpEF patients.",,,mnishino@osakah.johas.go.jp.

PED is an independent risk factor for increased 28-day and 90-day mortality in both neurological and nonneurological ICU patients (28-day mortality: plus 9%). The increased mortacity risk can be demonstrated for up to approximately one year after the ICU stay. Due to the consequences of PED, all ICU patients should undergo systematic dysphagia screening after extubation/decannulation (e.g., water swallow test) and fiberoptic endoscopic evaluation of the swallowing (FEES) to confirm the diagnosis. Treatment is interdisciplinary with nutrition adaptation/nutrition introduction or food restriction, physical/speech therapy and, if necessary, interventional procedures in the future. Schluckstörungen nach Extubation (Postextubationsdysphagie, PED) sind auf Intensivstationen häufig vorhanden und machen etwa 20 % eines gemischt medizinisch-chirurgischen Notfallpatientenkollektivs von Intensivstationen aus.

ARNAX activates cellular immunity via cross-presentation; hence, its practical application has been demonstrated in cancer immunotherapy. Given the importance of cellular immunity in virus infections, ARNAX is expected to be a more effective vaccine adjuvant for virus infections than alum, an adjuvant approved for human use that mainly enhances humoral immunity. In the present study, the trimeric recombinant spike protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was prepared as a vaccine antigen and formulated with ARNAX. When T-cell and neutralizing antibody responses were evaluated in immunized mice, antigen formulated with ARNAX generated significantly larger numbers of antigenspecific CD4 Cellular immunity is a critical immunological defense system against virus infections. However, aluminum salts, the most widely used adjuvant for vaccines for human use, do not promote strong cellular immunity. To prepare for the next pandemic of viral origin, the development of Th1-type adjuvants with low adverse reactions that induce cellular immunity is necessary. ARNAX is a TLR3 agonist consisting of DNA-RNA hybrid nucleic acid, which is expected to be an adjuvant that induces cellular immunity. The present study using a coronavirus disease 2019 mouse model demonstrated that ARNAX potently induces cellular immunity in addition to humoral immunity with minimal induction of inflammatory cytokines. Therefore, ARNAX has the potential to be used as a potent and welltolerated adjuvant for vaccines against pandemic viruses emerging in the future.",,,

This study evaluates the generalizability of V-1P enrollment criteria to the US population and their clinical comorbidity and CV risk factor burden. Data from National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (2015-March 2020) were used to determine nationally representative estimates. Inclusion criteria were low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) of 70-189 mg/dL and a 10-year ASCVD risk of ≥20% or 7.5%-19.9% with two CV risk enhancers. The pooled cohort equations (PCE) was used to stratify ASCVD risk in primary analysis. Estimates of the US population were compared with the V-1P eligible population. The V-1P eligible population included 23,837,940 adults. Compared with US adults ages 40-79 years, V-1P eligible adults had higher mean 10-year ASCVD risk by PCE (21.1% [95% CI: 20.1%-22.2%] vs 10.0% [95% CI: 9.4%-10.6%]).

PubMed; Google Scholar; industry and market reports; gray literature; pharmaceutical databases (eg, PharmaCompass); export records; pharmacies in Hamilton, Ont; industry professionals and leaders such as pharmaceutical company vice presidents, professors, a supply chain insurance company, and sustainable procurement consulting companies; and an international not-for-profit company. Data related to clonazepam's standard pharmaceutical production process, life cycle system boundaries, and most probable production locations were included in this review. This study depicts the estimated journey of a clonazepam pill's production and distribution, with the prescription being filled in Vancouver, BC. It begins with the extraction of salts to produce the active pharmaceutical ingredient. The main centres for clonazepam's active pharmaceutical ingredient and excipient salt extraction and production are in India and China. Quality testing and stocking occur elsewhere, such as within the European Union. The product is then shipped back to India for the next manufacturing stages. Excipients are shipped from China to India and are incorporated into formulation and tableting. The product is then sent to global markets for the final stages of pill formation and regional distribution. After shipment through Europe and Asia, the journey continues through several locations within the United States, specifically New Jersey, for the final stages of manufacturing. Once manufacturing is finalized in New Jersey, the pill is shipped to and repackaged in Tennessee for distribution and then sent to Canadian industry clusters, typically within the greater Toronto area in Ontario. Pills are then shipped to pharmacies and hospitals in Vancouver, BC, for consumer use. The total distance travelled in this scenario is approximately 63,162 km, not including the entire process of producing and shipping excipients or local retailer shipments.

Soft contact lens (CL) designs have been developed to slow myopia and potentially reduce long-term risk, but there is still a need for additional designs of varied materials and parameters to cater for diverse patient needs. The MultifocAL COntact Lenses for Myopia control study aims to compare the efficacy of the Acuvue Oasys for Presbyopia (AOP) CL against the Food and Drug Administration approved MiSight 1-Day multifocal CL in controlling progressive myopia in children using a non-inferiority contralateral eye design. A double-blind, contralateral eye, non-inferiority, randomised, controlled clinical trial will be conducted at University of New South Wales Sydney, Australia (UNSW). Children (6 to 12 years of age, inclusive) will be randomised to wear AOP in their right or left eye, with the MiSight 1-Day CL fitted to the contralateral eye. The primary outcome is the difference in axial length and cycloplegic objective refraction change between the two CLs over 12 months. Additional outcomes include quality of life, pupillometry and adherence to treatment. To achieve a statistical power of 80% to demonstrate non-inferiority of the AOP to the MiSight 1-Day and taking into consideration a 20% discontinuation rate, the calculated sample size is 72.

Little is known about the geographic distribution of PBC in the United States and the health care provider (HCP) landscape for patients with PBC. This real-world study aimed to estimate the prevalence of PBC in the United States, assess regional variability in its prevalence, and describe HCPs for patients with PBC. Patients with PBC were identified using Komodo's Healthcare Map, a large national administrative claims database. PBC prevalence per 100,000 adults was adjusted by age and gender at the 3-digit ZIP Code tabulation area level. Patients' PBC-related medical or pharmacy claims were used to determine HCP specialties and affiliations (academic vs. nonacademic); the latest claim and all claims were examined. The adjusted 2021 PBC prevalence was 40.9 per 100,000 adults. The highest absolute number of patients with PBC in the United States was in heavily populated urban areas, but prevalence adjusted for population size was highest in some rural areas. Among all claims, most (83.2%) patients received care from a specialist (gastroenterologist/hepatologist) at one time. However, only approximately half (53.5%) of patients with PBC, irrespective of therapy use, were most recently treated for PBC by a specialist. This is the most comprehensive and contemporary estimation of PBC prevalence in the United States to date. The pockets of high prevalence of PBC located in some rural areas highlight the need to better evaluate PBC risk factors and potential barriers in access to specialist care once patients are diagnosed.

Qualitative evidence is vital in providing greater understanding of patients, practitioners and carers experience of taking or delivering GLP-1 RAs. This evidence can inform the current or future configuration and delivery of services. We conducted a scoping review to better understand the quantity, nature and key characteristics of qualitative primary evidence which explores the experiences, views and perceptions of patients, carers and clinicians regarding the use of GLP-1 RAs. Four bibliographic databases were searched on 10 July 2024: MEDLINE, APA PsycInfo via Ovid, CINAHL Ultimate via EBSCOhost, ProQuest Dissertations and Theses Global via ProQuest. We also searched Google Scholar, two clinical trials registries, the pre-print server medRxiv and conducted citation searches. We sought qualitative research about the experiences of patients, carers and practitioners about any aspect of taking or prescribing GLP-1RAs, for any indication. Study selection and data extraction were performed by two independent reviewers. The included studies were collated, and their characteristics were described. After de-duplication 1545 titles and abstracts were screened for relevance, with 77 full-text articles assessed for eligibility, resulting in 25 included studies. More studies were focused on type 2 diabetes (n = 12) than weight loss (n = 9) or any indication (n = 4). The experiences of carers were not represented. No one area of experience (e.g. different indications or viewpoints) was well represented, either due to the absence or narrow focus of studies or lack of an in-depth analytical approach. Whilst primary qualitative evidence exploring patient and clinician experience of GLP-1 RAs was identified in this scoping review, the findings highlight a need for more robust qualitative research to be conducted across all user groups, in particular involving carers, and especially for the indication of weight loss within service settings. This evidence gap needs to be urgently addressed to ensure GLP-1 RAs are appropriately prescribed and patients and carers receive support from services suited to their needs. Seventeen public collaborators contributed to the search by suggesting additional search terms, helping define the population for inclusion and contributing to protocol development.

However, conventional lipid-lowering drugs such as statins and fibrates are limited by adverse effects, including hepatotoxicity and myopathy, which restrict their prolonged use. Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) and natural health products offer potential alternatives with multi-target mechanisms and improved safety profiles. Tangerine Peel Enzyme Drink (CPJS), a fermented health product derived from tangerine peel, has demonstrated lipid-modulating properties. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of CPJS in improving dyslipidemia and explore its underlying metabolic and microbiological mechanisms. A randomized, double-blind, parallel-controlled clinical trial was conducted with 72 participants (55 completers). Participants were divided into CPJS and control groups, receiving an 8-week intervention. Primary outcomes included changes in body weight and serum triglycerides (TG), while safety was assessed via liver/kidney function, creatine kinase, blood, and urine tests. Serum metabolomics (93 differential metabolites identified) and intestinal microbiota analysis were performed to elucidate metabolic pathways and microbial shifts. KEGG enrichment analysis mapped metabolites to biological pathways, such as lipid and amino acid metabolism. The CPJS group exhibited significant reductions in body weight and TG levels post-intervention (p < 0.05), with no adverse effects observed in safety biomarkers. Metabolomic profiling revealed alterations in fatty acyl, glycerophospholipid, and organic acid metabolites, indicating CPJS modulates lipid metabolism and energy homeostasis. KEGG analysis linked these changes to pathways including triglyceride degradation and amino acid metabolism. Additionally, CPJS increased specific gut microbial taxa associated with lipid regulation, suggesting a microbiome-mediated mechanism. CPJS demonstrates efficacy in improving dyslipidemia through dual mechanisms: direct modulation of triglyceride metabolism and indirect regulation via gut microbiota. Its safety profile aligns with findings from natural products like Cyclocarya paliurus and tempeh, which mitigate lipid abnormalities without hepatotoxicity. The multi-target action of CPJS mirrors TCM principles, where compounds like quercetin and flavonoids in CPJS may synergistically inhibit cholesterol synthesis and enhance lipid clearance. However, further research is needed to isolate active components and validate microbial contributions. Compared to synthetic drugs, CPJS offers a safer adjunct therapy, addressing limitations of current pharmacotherapies. Future studies should explore dose-response relationships and long-term outcomes in diverse populations.",Liu X,Production department,
40225272,From smoking cessation to physical activity: Can ontology-based methods for automated evidence synthesis generalise across behaviour change domains?,,Wellcome open research,10.12688/wellcomeopenres.21664.2,"Developing behaviour change interventions able to tackle major challenges such as non-communicable diseases or climate change requires effective and efficient use of scientific evidence. The Human Behaviour-Change Project (HBCP) aims to improve evidence synthesis in behavioural science by compiling intervention reports and annotating them with an ontology to train information extraction and prediction algorithms. The HBCP used smoking cessation as the first 'proof of concept' domain but intends to extend its methodology to other behaviours. The aims of this paper are to (i) assess the extent to which methods developed for annotating smoking cessation intervention reports were generalisable to a corpus of physical activity evidence, and (ii) describe the steps involved in developing this second HBCP corpus. The development of the physical activity corpus involved: (i) reviewing the suitability of smoking cessation codes already used in the HBCP, (ii) defining the selection criteria and scope, (iii) identifying and screening records for inclusion, and (iv) annotating intervention reports using a code set of 200+ entities from the Behaviour Change Intervention Ontology. Stage 1 highlighted the need to modify the smoking cessation behavioural outcome codes for application to physical activity. One hundred physical activity intervention reports were reviewed, and 11 physical activity experts were consulted to inform the adapted code set. Stage 2 involved narrowing down the scope of the corpus to interventions targeting moderate-to-vigorous physical activity. In stage 3, 111 physical activity intervention reports were identified, which were then annotated in stage 4. Smoking cessation annotation methods developed as part of the HBCP were mostly transferable to the physical activity domain. However, the codes applied to behavioural outcome variables required adaptations. This paper can help anyone interested in building a body of research to develop automated evidence synthesis methods in physical activity or for other behaviours. The Human Behaviour-Change Project (HBCP) wants to make it easier to gather and analyse information about how to change people's behaviour. To achieve this, the project collects reports about behaviour change interventions, code them based on an ontology (that is, a classification scheme to organise and represent information within a specific area), and use that data to train computer programs to automatically extract information from reports and make predictions. The project started with smoking cessation as a proof of concept but plans to expand to other behaviours. This study investigates how well the methods used for coding smoking cessation intervention reports could be applied to a new behaviour, physical activity, and describes how this new set of data on physical activity intervention reports was created. Building the HBCP physical activity data set involved: (1) checking if the ontology codes used for smoking cessation would work for physical activity, (2) deciding what kind of physical activity reports to include, (3) finding the reports, and (4) coding the reports using the ontology. During step 1 researchers found that some changes were needed to the codes used for smoking cessation, so they analysed 100 physical activity intervention reports and got feedback from experts to update the codes. After stages 2-4, they ended up with 111 physical activity reports coded using the ontology of behaviour change interventions. In conclusion, the methods used for coding smoking cessation intervention reports could mostly be applied to reports about physical activity interventions, but changes were needed in relation to the target behaviour (for example, how behaviour is measured or whether researchers want people to start vs stop doing something). The aim of this report is to help others looking to build a data set to improve ways in which information on behaviour change interventions is gathered and analysed.",,,

Y.)",10.1002/trc2.70081,"Minimal clinically important differences (MCIDs) for Alzheimer's disease (AD) have previously been estimated using clinician-based anchors. However, MCIDs have been criticized for not reflecting the preferences of people living with AD (PLWAD). Furthermore, interpretations of clinical trial results have been criticized for conflating within-person meaningfulness thresholds and between-group differences. Here, we simulate scenarios of disease slowing and compare those to published MCIDs. Scenarios of 5%-95% disease slowing were simulated using Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) data. Time saved and point differences on the Clinical Dementia Rating scale-Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB) were estimated for these scenarios and compared to published MCIDs. Scenario analyses resulted in estimates of time saved at ∼3 weeks-17 months and mean changes at 0.08-1.5 CDR-SB points over 18 months. The often referenced MCID for mild cognitive impairment (0.98) thereby corresponded to 11 months slowing, whereas the MCID for mild dementia (1.63) corresponded to >17 months slowing. Translating trial endpoints to estimates of time saved supports that often-referenced MCIDs may not be aligned with realistic and meaningful slowing of clinical progression. AD slowing of clinical progression by 5%-95% resulted in 0.74-17 months saved and 0.08-1.5 CDR-SB points change at 18 months.Slowing of at least 60% or 11 months of time saved over 18 months met an often-cited MCID threshold of 0.98 points for mild cognitive impairment.For mild AD dementia, an MCID of 1.63 meant that even an 18-month delay over 18 months would be considered only borderline meaningful-a face invalid and unrealistic proposition.",Paulsen R; Hahn-Pedersen JH; Polavieja P; Maltesen T; León T; ,; UsAgainstAlzheimer's and UsAgainstAlzheimer's Action Washington District of Columbia USA.; Novo Nordisk A/S Søborg Søborg Denmark.,

Despite minor difficulties with PWS internet connection, lost test kits, and delayed payment receipt, all participants were able to complete check-ins and received payments earned. Five PWS were abstinent at the final 6-month check-in, and two PWS were abstinent at all check-ins. Five PWS completed the end-of-study survey; four reported the intervention was helpful and would recommend it to others. A family-based financial incentive intervention for smoking cessation with ANAI families appears feasible.

40224298,Major Adverse Cardiovascular Events in Patients with Melanoma Receiving Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors.,,Journal of immunotherapy and precision oncology,10.36401/JIPO-24-31,"Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) might increase the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs). This study aimed to evaluate the risk of MACE in patients with melanoma after ICI initiation. We conducted a before-after cohort study using claims data from Optum's deidentified Clinformatics Data Mart Database. We included adult patients with melanoma who received any approved ICI between 2011 and 2021 with a minimum of 12 months of observable data before ICI. The main outcome was time to first MACE (myocardial infarction, coronary revascularization, stroke, heart failure hospitalization) and rate of MACE before and after ICI, ascertained using  We identified 4024 patients with ICI-treated melanoma. Mean age was 67.4 years (SD 14.1), 36% were women; 3066 (76.2%) received monotherapy and 958 (23.8%) combination immunotherapy. A total of 160 (4%) patients had a MACE before ICI and 224 (5.6%) after ICI (HR, 1.76; 95% CI, 1.47-2.12). MACE rate in the year before ICI was 56.16 per 1000 person-years compared with 80.91 per 1000 person-years the year after ICI (IRR, 1.44; 95% CI, 1.21-1.72). Ten cases of myocarditis were observed after ICI, 50% of them had a MACE. Risk factors associated with MACE after ICI were prior MACE, other cardiovascular conditions, hypertension, and older age. Glucocorticoid use was not associated with MACE. Our results suggest that ICI might increase the risk of MACE in patients with melanoma during the first year after ICI.",,,

This narrative review describes the unique mechanism of action of LBN and summarizes available real-world data. Upon instillation, LBN is metabolized into latanoprost acid and butanediol mononitrate, which is further reduced to NO and an inactive metabolite. Latanoprost acid increases aqueous humor outflow primarily through the uveoscleral (unconventional) pathway, whereas NO increases outflow through the trabecular (conventional) pathway. Eight studies were identified: 2 studies in newly diagnosed, treatment-naïve patients with OHT or OAG, 4 studies of adjunctive therapy in patients with glaucoma receiving other IOP-lowering therapies, and 2 studies in which patients with glaucoma switched to LBN monotherapy or adjunctive therapy. Decreases in IOP after initiating LBN in newly diagnosed patients or adding/switching to LBN were generally consistent with reductions observed in clinical trials and sustained throughout the studies. Rates of discontinuation due to inadequate IOP lowering ranged from 12.2% to 17.1%. LBN was generally well tolerated in real-world studies; the most common adverse events were consistent with the known safety profile of LBN. Data from real-world studies provide important insights regarding the potential effectiveness and tolerability of LBN in the clinical setting and suggest that LBN is well tolerated and associated with significant, clinically meaningful, and durable reductions in IOP.",,,

However, the failure to incorporate a drug's value when determining its price decreases pharmaceutical companies' motivation to develop and launch novel drugs in Japan. In this study, we applied the value-based pricing framework MARIE to drugs with new clinical status. We estimated drug prices at the time of approval for the initial indication and new clinical status, with a total of 32 drugs by using MARIE. To estimate maximum number of patients for the new clinical status, we referred to the market expansion rate and calculated it backwards. As a result, the median change of MARIE-estimated price under new clinical status against those under initial indication was -50.24% (range, -80.36% to 16.39%). For the initial indication, the median ratio of the drug price estimated with MARIE to the initial list price was 122.12% (range, 15.57% to 2237.38%); the median ratio of actual to estimated drug price were similar to those in our previous study (125.65%). We proposed the versatile, practical, convenient, multiple criteria, qualitative VBP framework MARIE for the new clinical status.

This was echoed in Prof. Rita Conti's September 17, 2024, Senate Finance Committee testimony. To test the IRA's impacts on early-stage investments targeting therapeutics for the Medicare-aged population, a longitudinal dataset of commercially sponsored clinical trials by companies with a market valuation  ≤ $2 billion was obtained from the BioMedTracker database. These trials were filtered and curated to match early-stage investments to lead assets undergoing clinical development from January 1, 2018, to August 16, 2024. From 161 lead assets with 619 individual investments, we find the aggregated total into large molecules in 2024 was 10 times larger than that for small molecules, which underwent a 68% decline after passage of the IRA. Individual investments made into small molecules decline by minus one-half as exposure to the Medicare-aged population increases after the passage of the IRA (p ≤ 0.0018). Testing large molecule investments by their exposure to Medicare post IRA's passage is statistically inconclusive. Research Conclusions. This study presents evidence of a decline in the development of new therapies targeting the Medicare-aged population since the passage of the IRA. If these impacts were due to the economic downturn post-pandemic, we would observe statistically similar results in both large and small molecules. However, the results by molecule type diverge.

Identifying walking loads associated with disease worsening presents intervention opportunities. Our purpose was to evaluate the longitudinal relation of the baseline vertical ground reaction force (GRF) during walking to worsening bone marrow lesions (BMLs) and cartilage damage using cohort data from the Multicenter Osteoarthritis Study (MOST). MOST participants with GRF data at baseline and magnetic resonance imaging examinations at baseline and 2-year follow-up were included. Peak impact force (PIF) and average loading rate (ALR) from the vertical GRF were analyzed with respect to four joint regions (i.e., the medial and lateral portions of the tibiofemoral and patellofemoral joints). Analyses used logistic regression with generalized estimating equations and adjusted for relevant covariates. Higher PIF was associated with increased odds of worsening BMLs in the lateral patellofemoral joint (odds ratio (95% confidence interval [CI]): 1.33 (1.11, 1.60)) and worsening cartilage damage in the lateral patellofemoral joint (1.48 (1.24, 1.77)), lateral tibiofemoral joint (1.24 (1.03, 1.50)), and medial tibiofemoral joint (1.25 (1.06, 1.48)). Higher ALR was associated with reduced odds of BML worsening in the lateral tibiofemoral joint (0.60 (0.41,0.87)). Higher peak forces when walking were associated with worsening BMLs in the lateral patellofemoral joint and with worsening cartilage damage in regions of the knee associated with higher contact forces during walking. Higher ALRs were not associated with increased odds of structural worsening (BMLs or cartilage).",,,lsara@bu.edu.

Less than 10% of people with FH have been detected and few receive recommended treatment. We report on the development of a national implementation strategy for enhancing the detection of FH in Australia. A modified intervention mapping study was conducted, through workshops to identify barriers and facilitators of FH detection, models for detection and their objectives. Practical implementation strategies were selected using a constructivist analysis and summaries of the strategies were disseminated for feedback. A case study showcase was used to monitor strategy implementation. Potential models for FH detection were identified, including (1) use of pathology lab reports and recall; (2) screening in general practice, pharmacy, and Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Organizations; (3) screening in cardiovascular inpatients, outpatients, and rehabilitation; (4) universal screening; and (5) centralized coordination of primary-tertiary shared care. Implementation strategies were selected for each model to support their operationalization into routine care. A list of general implementation strategies was also produced that could support multiple models for FH detection. We identified multiple FH detection models and strategies that would support implementation across Australia. Centralized coordination of a primary-tertiary shared care model was described as a promising approach for integrating index case detection with family cascade testing.

Myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein antibody-associated disease (MOGAD) is a demyelinating disorder distinct from MS in terms of pathophysiology and treatment options, also presenting with demyelinating attacks that can result in permanent disability. Given its unpredictable disease course, the need for biomarkers reflective of the risk for poor clinical recovery or relapsing course is pressing. The purpose of this review is to summarize the current knowledge on sNfL levels in people with MOGAD, assess their utility for clinical practice and gain insights for future research. Embase, MEDLINE, Scopus, and CINAHL databases were searched following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) recommendations. Keywords used in the search included: (myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein OR MOG OR MOGAD) AND (neurofilament* OR neuro filament* OR NfL OR sNfL). This initial search generated 195 reports, 23 of which were original research articles investigating NfL levels in MOGAD patients, therefore meeting our inclusion criteria. 422 MOGAD patients were involved across all studies. Most studies revealed higher sNfL in MOGAD patients (n = 292) than in healthy controls (n = 3,172) with one study finding higher sNfL in MOGAD only during relapse. sNfL levels during attacks were similar when comparing MOGAD (n = 94) to MS (n = 256) and MOGAD (n = 149) to APQ4+ neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (APQ4+ NMOSD) (n = 214). MOGAD patients with brain lesions on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) during a recent attack (n = 69 samples) had higher sNfL levels than patients without brain lesions (n = 78 samples). Median sNfL concentration was higher following clinical attacks (n = 69 samples) than in remission (n = 83 samples) in 3/5 studies. sNfL were higher at disease onset than subsequent attacks in 2 studies (n = 133 samples). Onset sNfL levels were not predictive of the likelihood of future relapse (relapsing: n = 15, monophasic: n = 18). A positive correlation was found between sNfL levels and attack severity assessed through various disability scales (n = 202), but not with the severity of acute or residual visual acuity (n = 45 eyes), or with residual retinal thickness among subjects with the optic neuritis (ON) phenotype (n = 11 eyes). The sGFAP/sNfL ratio showed utility in discriminating MOGAD from other autoimmune demyelinating diseases in two studies (MOGAD: n = 56, APQ4+ NMOSD: n = 66, MS: n = 31). sNfL levels at presentation have limited utility in distinguishing MOGAD from other demyelinating disorders, but their combination with other biomarkers might improve their diagnostic utility. sNfL levels are higher in brain/spinal cord presentations than optic neuritis, correlating with clinical severity of these phenotypes but less so with the severity of visual outcome. Further studies should clarify the utility of sNfL as a biomarker for MOGAD, particularly in relation to long-term outcomes and imaging markers of central nervous system damage. Standardized sNfL testing parameters will improve study comparability and clinical application.",,,mark.labib@uottawa.ca.

Linghe granules, a hospital-based formulation derived from a classic prescription, have demonstrated potential in reducing hepatic fat accumulation and improving metabolic health. This study provides a novel, comprehensive assessment of Linghe granules, integrating clinical, preclinical, and molecular analyses for NAFLD management. This study aims to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of Linghe granules in alleviating NAFLD through an integrated approach. A clinical trial involving 40 patients with NAFLD was conducted, with participants divided into a control group (lifestyle interventions) and a treatment group (lifestyle interventions plus oral Linghe granules). Various metabolic and liver function indicators were assessed before and after treatment. Additionally, a high-fat diet (HFD) was used to induce a NAFLD model in rat, followed by treatment with different doses of Linghe granules. In vitro studies on HepG2 and L02 cells were performed to the effects of the granules on lipid metabolism. Transcriptomic profiling, Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis (WGCNA), Dynamic Network Biomarkers (DNB) analysis, and molecular docking were employed to explore the underlying mechanisms. Linghe granules led to significant reductions in BMI, liver enzymes (AST, ALT), triglycerides, LDL-C, and GGT in patients with NAFLD, accompanied by a notable decrease in hepatic fat accumulation. In the rat model, treatment improved liver weight, liver function, and lipid metabolism. In vitro, Linghe granules decreased lipid accumulation and regulated key lipid metabolism markers, including sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 (SREBP-1), stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 (SCD1), and fatty acid-binding protein 5 (FABP5). Mechanistic analyses revealed that Linghe granules modulated oxidative stress-related pathways and genes involved in lipid metabolism. This study represents the first integrated evaluation of Linghe granules' efficacy and mechanisms in treating NAFLD, demonstrating their potential to improve liver function, reduce lipid accumulation, and modulate key metabolic markers. These results suggest that Linghe granules may serve as an effective adjunctive treatment for NAFLD.",,,Cguan2004@126.com.

Mitigating these events during early screening remains challenging. Several in vitro predictive models have been developed to address these issues, with varying success in detecting drug-induced inotropic changes. In this study, we compared traditional two-dimensional human-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (2D hiPSC-CMs) with three-dimensional engineered cardiac tissues (3D ECTs) to assess their ability to detect drug-induced inotropic changes in 17 drugs with known mechanisms of action. The models were exposed to various test compounds, and their responses were evaluated by measuring either the active force or maximum contraction speed. The 3D ECTs successfully detected all the tested positive inotropes, whereas the 2D hiPSC-CMs failed to detect the two compounds. Both models demonstrated high predictability for negative inotropy and showed similar results for detecting non-active compounds, except for higher concentrations of phentolamine, zimelidine, and tamsulosin. Irregular beating was less likely to occur in the 3D ECTs, suggesting that 3D ECTs provided superior detection of contractility compared to 2D hiPSC-CMs. Genetic analysis revealed a more mature phenotype for the 3D ECTs compared to the 2D hiPSC-CMs, and the compound-related target expression was comparable to that in the adult human heart tissues. The 3D ECTs captured inotropic changes more accurately and thus represented a more translatable model than the 2D hiPSC-CMs. Overall, contractility assessment using the 3D ECTs could be advantageous for profiling candidate compounds and mechanistic investigations of hemodynamic changes during in vivo or clinical studies.",Okai Y; Kaushik EP; Sameshima T; Feric N; Singh R; Pallotta I; Bogdanowicz DR; Gustilo MM; Harada K; Baker KS; Shinozawa T,Valo Health; Drug Safety Research and Evaluation,

Accurate measurement of cognitive change is essential for clinical trials. The change in cognitive scores, clinical metrics of physical disability, and neuroradiological metrics was quantified in data from a phase-3 randomized controlled trial of natalizumab in secondary progressive MS (SPMS). The adults diagnosed with SPMS for ≥ 2 years and Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) scores from 3 to 6.5 were randomized to receive natalizumab or placebo for 96 weeks. We evaluated change in Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT), Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test (PASAT), Selective Reminding Test (SRT), Brief Visuospatial Memory Test (BVMT-R), two subjective cognitive measures, Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-FS), Timed 25-foot Walk Test, Nine Hole Peg Test, measures of brain volume, and T2 lesion volume. The outcomes were evaluated at baseline, 48-, and 96-week follow-up. There were no significant differences in cognitive change between treatment arms. SDMT and PASAT scores improved over 96-weeks: mean SDMT scores by 4.5 points (SD 9.3), mean PASAT scores by 2.4 points (SD 9.4). Verbal and visuospatial memory test performance showed no consistent change. All MRI measures showed decreased brain volumes. NHPT scores worsened little and T25FW showed steadily worsening scores. Improvements in SDMT and PASAT performance were observed regardless of treatment arm. These findings are consistent with prior studies in MS. As it is unlikely that cognition improves over time in people with a chronic neurologic disease, these results support the need for cognitive outcomes that overcome practice and learning effects to accurately quantify change.",Comtois J,Department of Medicine,vl2337@cumc.columbia.edu.

40219861,Considerations from the pharmaceutical industry (IQ MPS affiliate) workshop on animal microphysiological systems and 3Rs in drug development.,,ALTEX,10.14573/altex.2503261,"Most complex in vitro models (CIVM) and microphysiological systems (MPS) are composed of human cells, with the goal of evaluating diseases, efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetic questions specifically for humans. The hope with CIVM/MPS is that they will eventually improve our predictivity for clinical responses and reduce or replace animal use in research, supporting the 3Rs concept of only using animals in research when necessary. Given the potential of animal-based models to advance this field by comparing existing in vivo animal data with new animal-based MPS responses, there are currently few CIVM and MPS utilizing animal tissues. Animal-based MPS may also have specific utility for cross-species comparisons or species-specific mechanistic questions on zoonotic diseases, and therapies for animals. Animal-based MPS may help expand in vitro-to in vivo correlations, advance the field and establish confidence in the predictive nature of such platforms. The IQ MPS-FDA workshop provided an interactive venue for pharmaceutical companies and regulatory agencies such as the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), NC3Rs (UK), Health Canada, NIH/NCATS, NIHS and PMDA (Japan), Danish Medicines Agency, European Commission, NIEHS/ICEATM, HHS, NIST, EURL ECVAM, and the IQ MPS Affiliate, a collaboration of pharmaceutical companies to jointly discuss considerations of animal-based MPS and applications where animal-based MPS are of potential value.

Diffusion MRI, enhanced by advanced bi-tensor models accounting for free water (FW), enables in vivo quantification of WM microstructural differences. To evaluate how AD genetic risk factors affect limbic WM microstructure - crucial for memory and early impacted in disease - we conducted linear regression analyses in a cohort of 2,614 non-Hispanic White aging adults (aged 50.12 to 100.85 years). The study evaluated 36 AD risk variants across 26 genes, the association between AD polygenic scores (PGSs) and WM metrics, and interactions with cognitive status. AD PGSs, variants in TMEM106B, PTK2B, WNT3, and apolipoprotein E (APOE), and interactions involving MS4A6A were significantly linked to WM microstructure. These findings implicate AD-related genetic factors related to neurodevelopment (WNT3), lipid metabolism (APOE), and inflammation (TMEM106B, PTK2B, MS4A6A) that contribute to alternations in WM microstructure in older adults. AD risk variants in TMEM106B, PTK2B, WNT3, and APOE genes showed distinct associations with limbic FW-corrected WM microstructure metrics. Interaction effects were observed between MS4A6A variants and cognitive status. PGS for AD was associated with higher FW content in the limbic system.",,,

Focusing on pain, this review addresses nociplastic and chronic pain conditions. Interventions designed to reduce inflammation, oxidative stress, and enhance vagal activity may offer a promising approach to managing post-pandemic pain. This review presents individual components of food supplements with demonstrated efficacy in one or more pain conditions, focusing on their proposed mechanisms and clinical activity in pain, including their use in post-COVID-19 pain when available. Many of these substances have a long history of safe use and may offer an alternative to long-term analgesic drug treatment, which is often associated with potential side effects. This review also explores the potential for synergistic effects when combining these substances with each other or with conventional analgesics, considering the advantages for both patients and the healthcare system in using these substances as adjunctive or primary therapies for pain symptoms related to long COVID. While preclinical scientific literature provides a mechanistic basis for the action of several food supplements on pain control mechanisms and signaling pathways, clinical experience, particularly in the field of long COVID-associated pain, is still limited. However, the reviewed literature strongly suggests that the use of food supplements in long COVID-associated pain is an attainable goal, provided that rigorous clinical trials are conducted.",,,

However, the response of these devices to potentially interfering nutritional, pharmaceutical, or endogenous substances is barely explored. We previously developed an in vitro test method for continuous and dynamic CGM interference testing and herein explore the sensitivity of the Abbott Libre2 (L2) and Dexcom G6 (G6) sensors to a panel of 68 individual substances. In each interference experiment, L2 and G6 sensors were exposed in triplicate to substance gradients from zero to supraphysiological concentrations at a stable glucose concentration of 200 mg/dL. YSI Stat 2300 Plus was used as the glucose reference method. Interference was presumed if the CGM sensors showed a mean bias of at least ±10% from baseline with a tested substance at any given substance concentration. Both L2 and G6 sensors showed interference with the following substances: dithiothreitol (maximal bias from baseline: L2/G6: +46%/-18%), galactose (>+100%/+17%), mannose (>+100%/+20%), and N-acetyl-cysteine (+11%/+18%). The following substances were found to interfere with L2 sensors only: ascorbic acid (+48%), ibuprofen (+14%), icodextrin (+10%), methyldopa (+16%), red wine (+12%), and xylose (>+100%). On the other hand, the following substances were found to interfere with G6 sensors only: acetaminophen (>+100%), ethyl alcohol (+12%), gentisic acid (+18%), hydroxyurea (>+100%), l-cysteine (-25%), l-Dopa (+11%), and uric acid (+33%). Additionally, G6 sensors could subsequently not be calibrated for use after exposure to dithiothreitol, gentisic acid, l-cysteine, and mesalazine (sensor fouling). Our standardized dynamic interference testing protocol identified several nutritional, pharmaceutical and endogenous substances that substantially influenced L2 and G6 sensor signals.

However, with the increased availability of newer and more specific biomarkers and molecular techniques, it is timely to revisit the utility of CK7 and CK20 stains under different clinical settings. In the current study, we retrospectively reviewed 612 surgical pathology cases at our institution where CK7 and/or CK20 stains were performed and determined to what degree they contributed to the final diagnosis. In CK7-and-CK20 cases, the stains had a major contribution in 5% of the cases. In CK7-only or CK20-only cases, the percentages of major contribution were 34% and 69% respectively. However, when only cases where CK7/CK20 stains were used to determine tumor site of origin, the contributions become more comparable across all three case types, where CK7/CK20 stains had major contribution in < 10% of cases. Notably, 11% of CK7-and-CK20 cases had no specific or suggestive diagnosis, and 40% of CK7-and-CK20 cases had staining patterns inconsistent with the final diagnosis. Detailed analysis demonstrates that CK7 and CK20 stains, used singly, are most useful in the diagnosis of a limited number of pathologic entities with distinct CK7 or CK20 expression patterns. Our results suggest that the coordinate expression of CK7 and CK20 is generally not helpful in arriving at the final diagnosis. Reducing unnecessary immunohistochemical stains will help mitigate the rising healthcare cost and preserve tissue for molecular testing.",,,jiaoti.huang@duke.edu.

While ICSI's role in couples with severe male factor infertility is well established, its routine use in cases with normal or nonseverely decreased sperm quality is not evidence-based. Here we conducted the INVICSI study, an open-label, multicenter randomized controlled trial, to compare cumulative live birth rates (CLBR) as the primary outcome between ICSI and c-IVF in patients without severe male factor infertility. Between November 2019 and December 2022, 824 women undergoing their first IVF cycle were randomized to ICSI (n = 414) or c-IVF (n = 410) across six public fertility clinics in Denmark. The CLBR was 43.2% (179/414) in the ICSI group and 47.3% (193/408) in the c-IVF group, yielding a risk ratio of 0.91 (95% confidence interval, 0.79-1.06). These findings demonstrate that ICSI does not improve CLBR compared to c-IVF and support c-IVF as the preferred first-line treatment for patients with normal or nonseverely decreased sperm quality. ICSI should be reserved for severe male factor infertility. ClinicalTrials.gov registration: NCT04128904 .",,,nina.la.cour.freiesleben@regionh.dk.

In response, public policies were enacted to mitigate this effect. However, there is limited evidence examining surgical device industry payments and surgeons' utilization of robot-assisted surgeries (RAS). This study assessed the relationship between industry payments to healthcare providers and the usage of RAS. Using 2015-2020 data from the CMS ""Sunshine"" Open Payments Database and New York State's (NYS) Statewide hospital discharge databases, we assessed temporal and spatial relationships between industry payments to hospitals and surgeons and volumes of RAS. During 2015-2020, general surgery robotic device manufacturers paid providers more than $236 M nationwide. The highest proportion of payments was made toward ""Education and training"" (66.6%) and ""Food and travel"" (20.6%). In NYS, gastrointestinal (GI) RAS volume steadily increased by 182% (2015-2019, p < 0.01), while there was a 150% increase in general surgeon payments. Genitourinary (GU) and gynecological (GYN) surgeon payments remained unchanged but GU and GYN RAS volume increased by 17% and 75%, respectively, during this period (p < 0.05). Approximately, 93% of payments and 98% of abdomen and pelvic RAS in NYS were concentrated in metropolitan or non-rural counties. With increasing payments from robotic device companies toward surgeon education and training, the use of RAS is likely to continue to rise in the long term. Unbiased and non-industry-funded studies examining RAS effect on surgeon behavior and patient outcomes are imperative to ensure system efficiency and patient safety.",,,ajayanan@buffalo.edu.

All beneficiaries of the Italian National Health Service (NHS) aged 50-85 years residing in Lombardy. Data were separately analysed for each year from 2004 to 2023, with thus the availability of 20 study populations. Comorbidities were traced via the medical services provided by the NHS, and the overall quantification was obtained by the Multisource Comorbidity Score, which was developed and validated for the Italian population. The temporal analysis of the 20 yearly temporal comorbidity rates was obtained by the Age-Cohort-Period models. The comorbidities prevalence trends were forecasted from 2025 to 2050. From 2004 to 2023, the prevalence of comorbidities declined from 46% to 40% in men and from 47% to 42% in women. An increase in prevalence between the ages of 50 and 85 years was observed for both women (from 33% to 63%) and men (from 29% to 67%). A declining prevalence was observed among cohorts born from 1922 to 1970 for both women (by 33%) and men (by 50%). A continued decline in the absolute number and prevalence rate of comorbidities is expected for both women and men until 2050. The decline in ageing-related comorbidity prevalence over time may persist up to 2050.

40216062,A multi-omics study reveals molecular characteristics and therapeutic targets of salidroside in reducing TGF-β2-induced ECM expression.,,Experimental eye research,10.1016/j.exer.2025.110386,"Primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) is a leading cause of irreversible blindness worldwide, driven by elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) due to trabecular meshwork (TM) fibrosis, extracellular matrix (ECM) accumulation, and increased aqueous humor outflow resistance. Transforming growth factor-beta 2 (TGF-β2) promotes the expression of fibrosis-related genes, exacerbating these effects. Salidroside, a bioactive compound, has been shown to inhibit TGF-β2-induced ECM expression and alleviate ocular hypertension. However, its underlying molecular mechanisms remain unclear. This study explores the transcriptional, proteomic, and metabolic changes in human TM cells treated with TGF-β2 and salidroside. Human TM cells were treated with TGF-β2 (5 ng/mL) for 48 h, followed by salidroside (30 μM) for 24 h. Multi-omics analyses, including transcriptomics, label-free proteomics, and non-targeted metabolomics, were performed to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs), proteins (DEPs), and metabolites. The results revealed that TGF-β2 inhibited HTM cell metabolism, affecting pathways like the TCA cycle. Salidroside restores balance by regulating 15 key biomolecules, including MELTF and SLC25A10, through dual-level and post-translation mechanisms. ROC and docking analyses highlight salidroside's role in enhancing metabolic transport and energy activity, with SLC25A10 also linked to RNA processing, showcasing its therapeutic potential. These findings provide valuable insights into POAG pathogenesis and the therapeutic potential of salidroside, offering a foundation for the future development of novel treatment strategies targeting transcriptional, translational, and metabolic dysregulation in POAG.",,,gaozq70@163.com.

Additionally, the incremental contribution of type 2 inflammation, a common, treatable process, is undetermined. We aimed to quantify the prognostic value of baseline characteristics and type 2 inflammatory biomarkers, specifically blood eosinophil count and fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO), to predict asthma attacks. In this systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials (RCTs), Oxford Asthma Attack Risk Scale 2 (ORACLE2), we searched MEDLINE from Jan 1, 1993, to April 1, 2021, for trials investigating fixed treatment regimen effects on asthma attack rates for at least 6 months with baseline blood eosinophil count and FeNO. Eligible participants were aged 12 years or older with asthma (any severity) who had been randomly assigned to the control group of an RCT. Relevant trials were manually retrieved and reviewed by two independent reviewers (SC and IDP). Disagreements were discussed with five reviewers. Individual patient data (IPD) for meta-analysis were requested from study authors. We investigated the rate of severe asthma attacks (≥3 days of systemic corticosteroids) for at least 6 months and prognostic effects of baseline blood eosinophil count and FeNO in control group participants. Rate ratios (RRs) with 95% CIs were derived for annualised asthma attack rates from negative binomial models adjusted for key variables, including blood eosinophil count and FeNO, and interactions between these type 2 inflammatory biomarkers were explored. Certainty of evidence was assessed using GRADE. The heterogeneity of the included studies and potential for ecological bias were quantified by the concordance statistic (C-statistic). This study was registered with PROSPERO, CRD42021245337. We identified 976 potentially eligible studies. After automated screening, we manually reviewed 219 full-text articles. Of these, 19 publications comprising 23 RCTs were eligible. 6513 participants (4140 [64%] female; 2370 [36%] male; three missing) spanning 22 RCTs were included for data analysis. 5972 (92%) of 6513 patients had moderate-to-severe asthma. 4615 asthma attacks occurred during 5482 person-years of follow-up (annualised rate 0·84 per person-year). Higher blood eosinophil count or FeNO was linked to higher asthma attack risk (per 10-fold increase, RR 1·48 [95% CI 1·30-1·68] for blood eosinophil count and 1·44 [1·26-1·65] for FeNO; high-certainty evidence).

A systematic literature review was performed to identify randomized controlled trials of GLP-1 RAs in patients with T2DM treated with insulin and an antihyperglycaemic drug. For the NMA, studies included trials with 100% of patients treated with basal insulin background therapy with a titration scheme comparable to the SURPASS-5 trial. The following data were extracted for efficacy and safety assessment at the primary endpoint of each study: changes from baseline in glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) and body weight and the incidence of nausea, vomiting or diarrhoea, hypoglycaemia, and patients discontinuing treatment because of adverse events. In this study, a comparative analysis of tirzepatide was performed with the GLP-1 RAs dulaglutide, exenatide, and lixisenatide in addition to placebo. A total of six studies were included across the analyses. Tirzepatide 5, 10, and 15 mg showed statistically significant, greater reductions in HbA1c and body weight at the primary endpoint versus all GLP-1 RA comparators and placebo. Tirzepatide 5, 10, and 15 mg showed a statistically significant, higher likelihood of experiencing nausea compared with those who received placebo or exenatide 2 mg; no statistically significant differences were observed when compared with all other GLP-1 RA comparators. No statistically significant differences were observed in the proportions of patients who discontinued treatment because of adverse events when tirzepatide 5, 10, and 15 mg were compared with GLP-1 RA comparators, apart from tirzepatide 10 and 15 mg versus placebo. Tirzepatide demonstrated statistically significantly greater reductions in HbA1c and body weight when compared with selected GLP-1 RAs and placebo in patients with T2DM treated with basal insulin.

This study aimed to evaluate potential drug lag and drug loss by assessing Japan's participation in global phase III multinational/multiregional clinical trials (MRCTs) targeted cancers. Phase III MRCTs of anticancer drugs initiated between 2008 and 2022 were collected. Information of participant countries, study sponsor, study design, and cancer type were collected and analyzed by logistic regression analysis to identify factors affected Japan's participation. Of 999 phase III MRCTs, Japan's participation every 5 years increased over 15 years (2008-2012: 34.3%, 2013-2017: 51.6%, 2018-2022: 60.2%), while Japan's non-participation numbers did not change (2008-2012: 157, 2013-2017: 167, 2018-2022: 165). In the multivariate logistic regression analysis, the absence of an operational base in Japan and minor cancers were negatively associated with Japan's participation in phase III MRCTs. Japan's participation was also associated with some cancer organs and drug modalities. Potential future drug lag and increases of unapproved drugs were expected to increase. Since the inclusion of Japan in MRCTs results in shorter or no approval lag, Japan should promote to make circumstances where small overseas companies can include Japan in MRCTs.",,,kaname.shiga.med@gmail.com.

Data are reported from the extended dataset (patients receiving continuous baricitinib 2 mg or 4 mg) and the all-baricitinib dataset (all patients receiving any dose of baricitinib at any time during the trials). Safety outcomes include treatment-emergent adverse events, adverse events of special interest, and abnormal changes in laboratory test results. Incidence rates (IRs) per 100 patient-years were calculated based on time at risk. Data cutoff dates were 22 May, 2023, for BRAVE-AA1 and 8 May, 2023, for BRAVE-AA2 and included follow-up through at least 152 weeks. Data were collected for 1303 patients treated with baricitinib, reflecting 2789.7 patient-years of exposure (median, 825 days; maximum, 1460 days). Most treatment-emergent adverse events were mild to moderate in severity. Incidence rates of serious adverse events (IR = 2.6) and treatment discontinuations because of adverse events (IR = 1.7) were generally low and remained similar to data presented through at least 104 weeks of follow-up. In an additional 1 year of follow-up, no new cases of serious infections, opportunistic infections, major adverse cardiovascular events, deep vein thromboses, or pulmonary embolisms were observed. The IRs for non-melanoma skin cancer (IR = 0.1) and other malignancies (IR = 0.2) remained stable over time. The IR of herpes zoster was comparable to previously reported IRs (IR = 1.9). Laboratory changes were generally consistent over time. No deaths were reported in either study. Long-term safety data from BRAVE-AA1 and BRAVE-AA2 are consistent with previously reported data from the baricitinib alopecia areata clinical trial program and demonstrate no new safety concerns or signals for baricitinib through a maximum exposure of 4 years. BRAVE-AA1 (NCT03570749) and BRAVE-AA2 (NCT03899259) were registered on 18 June, 2018, and 1 April, 2019, respectively. Baricitinib is a Janus kinase inhibitor approved in several countries to treat severe alopecia areata, an autoimmune disease that causes patchy or complete hair loss on the scalp, face, and body. Given the chronic nature of alopecia areata, it is important to understand the safety of longer term treatment with baricitinib. In this study, we examined the safety profile of baricitinib through at least 152 weeks and up to 4 years of exposure. Our analysis included two datasets from two ongoing alopecia areata clinical trials of baricitinib in adults with at least 50% scalp hair loss. The first dataset included patients treated continuously with baricitinib 2 mg or 4 mg, and the second dataset included patients treated with baricitinib 1 mg, 2 mg, or 4 mg at any time up to the data cutoff. The incidence rates of serious adverse events were low and similar across datasets and dose groups. There have been no new cases of serious infections, opportunistic infections, major adverse cardiovascular events, deep vein thromboses, or pulmonary embolisms since the previous safety analysis conducted through week 104. The incidence rates of non-melanoma skin cancer and other malignancies have remained low and stable. Overall, the incidence rates of adverse events of special interest were within or below those observed in the general alopecia areata population. The results of longer term treatment with baricitinib in adults with severe alopecia areata were consistent with prior reports and revealed no new safety concerns.",Blume-Peytavi U; Sontag A; Dutronc Y; Denning K; Kolodsick J; Lu X; Srivastava A,Eli Lilly and Company; Department of Dermatology; TechData Service Company,brett.aking@gmail.com.
40214707,Cost and Duration of Clinical Trials in Drug Development by Japanese Pharmaceutical Companies.,,Pharmaceutical medicine,10.1007/s40290-025-00558-x,"Understanding parameters such as cost and duration, which reflect the scale of clinical trials, is essential for government agencies to formulate pharmaceutical policies and for pharmaceutical companies to strategically allocate resources. As most studies on clinical trial costs and durations have primarily focused on pharmaceutical companies developing drugs in the USA, understanding actual trial costs and durations for Japanese pharmaceutical companies engaged in global development or development within their own countries remains challenging. This study aimed to clarify the actual phase-specific costs and durations of clinical trials conducted by leading Japanese pharmaceutical companies and to identify the factors influencing these parameters. We conducted a questionnaire-based survey among 22 pharmaceutical companies headquartered in Japan. Respondents from each company retrospectively identified clinical trials for new drug applications or for expanding approved disease indications, conducted between 2012 and 2022, providing cost and duration data of each clinical trial. We calculated summary statistics for costs and durations by phase and conducted an exploratory analysis of the variables influencing these parameters. In total, 631 projects with clinical trials conducted by these companies were analyzed. The median costs in the analysis population were 859 million Japanese yen (JPY) for Phase 1, 1,739 million JPY for Phase 2, and 4,183 million JPY for Phase 3. For reference, the median annual average exchange rates during the study period were 109 JPY per US dollar (USD) and 130 JPY per euro (EUR). The median durations were 20 months for Phase 1, 29 months for Phase 2, and 31 months for Phase 3. For projects targeting approval only in Japan, the median Phase 3 cost was 3,050 million JPY, while for projects targeting approval involving the USA or Europe, it was 8,083 million JPY. This study quantifies the costs and durations incurred by Japanese pharmaceutical companies in conducting clinical trials, revealing the high costs associated with projects targeting approval involving the USA or Europe. The findings highlight the substantial investments required by the Japanese pharmaceutical industry to bring new drugs to the global market.",Okada N; Takahashi Y,Office of Pharmaceutical Industry Research,opir-sp@jpma.or.jp.

While both MAP and coma on admission are critical prognostic factors, the relationship between them and their prognostic significance based on coma status remains unclear. A retrospective analysis of 543 AMI-CS patients was conducted. The overall median MAP was 77 mmHg, with no significant difference between the coma and non-coma groups. The coma group had a higher 30-day mortality compared with the non-coma group (50% vs. 29%; P<0.001). The area under the curve for MAP predicting 30-day mortality was 0.723 (P<0.001) in the coma group, with a cut-off MAP of 76.3 mmHg (sensitivity 0.66, specificity 0.69), but was insignificant in the non-coma group (AUC 0.543; P=0.176). Kaplan-Meier analysis showed higher mortality with low MAP (<77 mmHg) in the coma group, whereas MAP had no significant impact in the non-coma group. Multivariate Cox regression identified low MAP as an independent prognostic factor in the coma group only. The associations between MAP and prognosis differ depending on the coma status in AMI-CS. Low MAP is a prognostic factor for mortality only in patients with coma. This study highlights the need for treatment strategies tailored to neurological status.",,,
40213068,Nanosecond Laser Pulses Facilitating Efficient and Specific Cell Killing with Doxorubicin-Loaded Gold Nanoparticles Targeted to the Folate Receptor.,,Small science,10.1002/smsc.202400234,"Nanoparticle-based drug carrier systems with active targeting and a controlled release capacity are of considerable interest to bypass side effects of conventional chemotherapy. One appealing approach involves chemotherapeutic-loaded photothermal nanoparticles, where laser irradiation can release the loaded anticancer drug while also inducing local cytotoxicity through photothermal effects. This study investigates the potential of using nanosecond-pulsed laser light for efficient and specific killing of folate receptor (FR)-overexpressing cancer cells in combination with FR-targeted doxorubicin-loaded gold nanoparticles (AuNPs). Nanosecond pulsed laser irradiation allows the induction of mechanical forces alongside thermal effects. The effect of nanoparticle concentrations and laser fluences on cytotoxicity is systematically tested, achieving near-complete tumor cell killing under the most stringent conditions. FR targeting is confirmed using FR-positive and -negative cell lines, showing that folic acid functionalization of AuNPs results in more favorable nanoparticle-cell interactions and more efficient photothermal effects. Additionally, doxorubicin could be efficiently released from the AuNPs and endosomal compartments upon laser irradiation, adding to the observed cytotoxicity. Cell killing was precisely confined to irradiated cells, leaving surrounding cells unharmed. Overall, the significant reduction of tumor cell viability following the proposed combination demonstrates this approach to be a promising step toward safer, more effective anticancer therapies.",,,

Categorical data were extracted from the three 5-week, randomized, double blind, placebo controlled EMERGENT-1, EMERGENT-2, and EMERGENT-3 clinical trials of xanomeline/trospium in adults with schizophrenia experiencing acute psychosis. Efficacy was assessed using the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), Clinical Global Impression-Severity (CGI-S), and categorical response criteria. Safety and tolerability were assessed using rates of discontinuation and treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs). NNT, NNH, and LHH values were calculated for each individual study as well as pooled. In data from the acute EMERGENT trials, NNT estimates were significant for xanomeline/trospium vs placebo for the pre-specified treatment response threshold of ≥30% reduction from baseline in PANSS total score at Week 5 (NNT=5 [95% CI, 4-8]). NNT estimates for response thresholds of ≥20% and ≥40% reduction from baseline in PANSS total score and ≥1- and ≥2-point decrease from baseline in CGI-S score were <10, indicating a clinically relevant therapeutic benefit of xanomeline/trospium over placebo. Estimates of NNH vs placebo for the most common TEAEs were >10, with the exception of nausea and vomiting; however, rates of discontinuations due to TEAEs of nausea, dyspepsia, or vomiting were low (NNH=49 [95% CI, 28-182]). LHH indicated an overall benefit of xanomeline/trospium vs placebo for all assessed outcomes.

However, uptake of decision aids has been poor, in part because the time required to incorporate these into clinical practice is not well understood. To estimate the time required for a rheumatology clinic to implement a validated decision aid for patients with lupus. Using a cohort of eight implementation sites, study investigators identified the activities required to administer a decision aid. Site coordinators embedded within the clinics timed the duration of each activity. To estimate the effect of viewing the decision aid on the length of the physician-patient interaction, patient visits were timed and the length of visits for patients who viewed the decision aid were compared with visit lengths for three groups of control patients. Estimates of the effect of the decision aid on patient visit lengths ranged from a reduction of 3 min per visit to an increase of 3.88 min per visit, with five out of six estimates suggesting the decision aid is associated with shorter patient visits. Introducing the decision aid to patients took a mean of 4.12 min (median of 2 min). Identifying patients eligible for the decision aid was a weekly or bi-weekly process for most clinics and took an average of 41.43 min. The time required for a rheumatology clinic to implement the decision aid for patients with lupus is low. Our results raise questions about why decision aid take up is low among clinical practices, given the benefits the lupus decision aid offers to patients (reduced decisional conflict and better-informed choice of immunosuppressive medications used for the treatment of lupus kidney disease).

However, older adults face a particular challenge in implementing DiGA since higher age is a decisive predictor of lower digital health literacy. The necessity of an independent use of the prescribed DiGA is therefore associated with challenges for older patients and providers. In practice, it is crucial not to leave patients, especially older adults, alone after prescribing, but to maintain close contact to overcome technical and motivational barriers and to ensure that the novel application is used. However, this is difficult for physicians and psychotherapists due to the critical healthcare system situation in Germany described above. Another support system is needed. Hence, the main hypothesis of this study is that the additional implementation of digital nurses leads to a higher percentage of older patients with depressive symptoms starting DiGA use compared to a prescription and information alone. Two DiGA for mild to moderate depression in older patients were available and permanently approved at the time of the funding application. Using the most suitable one of them, as shown in a pilot study, the feasibility of implementation will be examined within a randomized proof of concept study. In our study, a digital nurse is trained to support patients with depression in using a DiGA. The main outcome is DiGA use (first session started: yes/no) after 8 weeks. Major secondary outcomes are patient-relevant outcomes, feasibility of recruitment and intervention, and factors moderating the effect or predicting DiGA use in the target group. Best practice guidelines will be elaborated on how to support and improve DiGA prescription and successful use in this population. In Germany, the approved DiGA are currently little used, especially by people with a low digital affinity. This proof of concept study will use the example of older people with depressive disorders to show whether it is possible to increase the usage rate of a DiGA with the support of a digital nurse so that a DiGA can become a serious therapy option.

The proportion of ophthalmology visits was 88.0% at the initiation of HCQ prescription, decreased to 76.3% after one year, and then remained constant. Moreover, only 50% of the patients underwent spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) and automated visual field (VF) tests, which are useful for the early detection of HCQ retinopathy-related changes. Importantly, the proportion of ophthalmology visits remained consistently high among patients who visited an ophthalmologist in the previous year, ranging from 77.3% to 90.2%.

Although targeted therapy for this mutation requires genomic testing in Japan, turnaround time (TAT) is often unacceptably long, especially for certain conditions, such as ATC, which is one of the most aggressive cancers. Here, we evaluated concordance between immunohistochemistry (IHC) with a relatively short TAT of a few days and genomic testing in thyroid cancer. Immunohistochemical staining was performed with BRAF (VE1) antibody (Ventana) using the OptiView method on samples already undergoing genomic testing. A pathologist blindly annotated each staining expression with a cut-off of 1% in the cytoplasm. We then calculated the positive percent agreement (PPA), negative percent agreement (NPA), and overall percent agreement (OPA). We identified 62 samples, including 12 of ATC, that underwent genomic testing using different methods: Oncomine Dx Target Test (ODxTT) (n = 32), MEBGEN BRAF 3 Kit (MEBGEN3) (n = 14), FoundationOne CDx (F1CDx) (n = 13), and GenMineTOP (TOP) (n = 1). Annotation results of IHC were positive for 31, negative for 29, and undeterminable for 2 samples due to low tumor content.

Some consider that partially resected lesions require specialized techniques such as endoscopic submucosal dissection, full-thickness resection, or surgery. We investigated whether traditional endoscopic resection methods were safe and effective. We report results of endoscopic resection of previously partially resected colorectal polyps by means of conventional resection methods (snare resection with or without injection and/or avulsion) and compare outcomes with lesions without previous partial resection. This is a retrospectively evaluated assessment of a prospectively collected database at a single tertiary academic center. From August 12, 2019, to May 14, 2024, 1101 referred colorectal lesions underwent conventional resection and at least 1 surveillance colonoscopy. The last follow-up colonoscopy included in the study was performed on July 19, 2024. Out of the 1101 lesions, 220 had previous partial resection by means of snare, hot biopsy forceps, or surgical transanal excision. All of these 220 lesions were successfully resected with the use of conventional methods, and recurrence rates at first follow-up (8.2%) were similar to lesions without previous resection (7.8%; P = .889), as was the perforation rate (0.5% vs 0.3%). Compared with lesions with no previous resection, previously partially resected lesions were more often resected by means of electrocautery (94.1% vs 64.2%; P < .001), and required the cap technique (36.4% v. 17.4%; P < .001) and avulsion (65.5% v 28.8%; P < .001).

The main human isoform is CYP3A4, a highly flexible protein that can act on a diverse set of substances and that is inhibited by compounds varying greatly in size. To accompany the different ligands, substantial conformational changes occur that transform the active-site binding pocket between a collapsed form and various open states. A large body of biophysical data including high-resolution structures are available but there is still a lack of understanding of the dynamic properties of CYP3A4. Here, we present the first room-temperature structure of CYP3A4 solved by serial crystallography. The structure is overall very similar to structures solved at cryo-temperature of the un-bound form of the enzyme including the conformation of the active-site lid. We observe that loops are better defined at room-temperature despite the lower resolution of this structure. Based on an internal distance matrix analysis of a large set of CYP3A4 structures, we conclude that the crystal form rather than temperature is determining for how the structures cluster. Finally, a workflow for generating microcrystals suitable for fixed-target serial crystallography data collection is described. This work lays the foundation for future studies of ligand-induced dynamics and structural transitions during the catalytic reaction of CYP3A4.",,,gisela.branden@gu.se.
40209713,Advancing precision care in pregnancy through a treatable fetal findings list.,,American journal of human genetics,10.1016/j.ajhg.2025.03.011,"The use of genomic sequencing (GS) for prenatal diagnosis of fetuses with sonographic abnormalities has grown tremendously over the past decade. Fetal GS also offers an opportunity to identify incidental genomic variants that are unrelated to the fetal phenotype but may be relevant to fetal and newborn health. There are currently no guidelines for reporting incidental findings from fetal GS. In the United States, GS for adults and children is recommended to include a list of ""secondary findings"" genes (ACMG SF v.3.2) that are associated with disorders for which surveillance or treatment can reduce morbidity and mortality. The genes on ACMG SF v.3.2 predominantly cause adult-onset disorders. Importantly, many genetic disorders with fetal and infantile onset are treatable as well. A proposed solution is to create a ""treatable fetal findings list,"" which can be offered to pregnant individuals undergoing fetal GS or, eventually, as a standalone cell-free fetal DNA screening test. In this integrative review, we propose criteria for a treatable fetal findings list, then identify genetic disorders with clinically available or emerging fetal interventions and those for which clinical detection and intervention in the first week of life might lead to improved outcomes. Finally, we synthesize the potential benefits, limitations, and risks of a treatable fetal findings list.",,,ngold@mgh.harvard.edu.

The linker influences many steps of the PROTAC mode of action, from cellular permeability to ternary complex formation and target degradation. Much interest has therefore been devoted to linker design to fine-tune molecular and mechanistic properties of PROTACs. In this study, we present FerroTACs, a novel PROTAC design strategy incorporating ferrocene as the linker chemotype. We exemplify the approach across three different PROTAC systems: VHL-VHL (homo-PROTACs), VHL-CRBN, and VHL-BETs. We find that ferrocene's unique organometallic structure, featuring freely rotating cyclopentadienyl rings around a central Fe(II) ion, acts as a molecular hinge enabling structural adjustment to the environment that results in properties alteration, i.e., chameleonicity. Conformational analyses via NMR spectroscopy support ferrocene's role in fostering intramolecular interactions that result in a more folded state in an apolar environment. This property promotes compact conformations, improving cellular permeability and reducing efflux liabilities. Cellular assays demonstrate that FerroTACs exhibit robust target degradation and cell permeability profiles, en-par or enhanced compared to benchmark PROTACs ",,,

Our study aimed to explore the associations between maternal dietary patterns during pregnancy, duration of breastfeeding, and their impacts on child head circumference and cognitive outcomes. Our study utilised data from the Copenhagen Prospective Studies on Asthma in Childhood 2010 cohort, which enrolled 700 mother-child pairs between 2008 and 2010 with 86% clinical follow-up at age 10. Pregnancy dietary patterns, described as 'Varied' and 'Western,' were derived from food frequency questionnaires and used to model quantitative metabolite scores via sparse partial least squares modelling of blood metabolome data. Cognitive development was assessed using the Bayley Scales of Infant Development at 2.5 years and the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children at age 10. Head circumference was measured from 20 weeks gestation to 10 years, and calibrated using related anthropometric measures. Growth trajectories were evaluated using linear mixed models and latent class trajectory models. Parental and child genetic influences for cognition and head circumference were controlled by including polygenic risk scores derived from genomic data. We found that a Western dietary pattern during pregnancy was associated with lower cognitive scores at age 2.5 (β -1.24 [-2.16, -0.32], p = 0.008) and reduced head circumference growth (p-interaction < 0.0001). We found that a Varied dietary pattern during pregnancy was associated with higher estimated intelligence quotient (IQ) at age 10 (β 1.29 [0.27, 2.3], p = 0.014). Additionally, head circumference growth was associated with higher cognitive scores at age 10 (β 3.40 [1.21, 5.60], p = 0.002), and it partly mediates the association between the Varied dietary pattern and estimated IQ (proportion mediated 13.5% [0.01, 0.71], p = 0.034). Extended breastfeeding duration was also independently associated with increased head circumference growth (p-interaction < 0.0001). These patterns and correlations were consistent even after adjusting for potential confounders and accounting for genetic influences. Our findings reveal that a Western dietary pattern during pregnancy is associated with lower cognitive scores at age 2.5 and decreased head circumference growth, suggesting potential adverse impacts on early neurodevelopment. Conversely, a Varied dietary pattern is linked with a higher estimated IQ at age 10, with head circumference growth contributing to this positive outcome. These findings highlight the critical role of maternal nutrition during pregnancy, and duration of breastfeeding, in promoting optimal neurodevelopmental outcomes. Effective public health strategies should therefore focus on enhancing maternal dietary practices to support better cognitive and physical development in children.",,,

To evaluate whether computerized provider order entry (CPOE) prompts providing patient- and pathogen-specific MDRO infection risk estimates can reduce empiric extended-spectrum antibiotics for non-critically ill patients admitted with abdominal infection. This 92-hospital cluster randomized clinical trial assessed the effect of an antibiotic stewardship bundle with CPOE prompts vs routine stewardship on antibiotic selection during the first 3 hospital days (empiric period) in non-critically ill adults hospitalized with abdominal infection. The trial population included adults (≥18 years) treated with empiric antibiotics for abdominal infection in non-intensive care units (ICUs). The trial periods included a 12-month baseline from January to December 2019 and an intervention period from January to December 2023. CPOE prompts recommending standard-spectrum antibiotics in patients prescribed extended-spectrum antibiotics during the empiric period if the patient's estimated absolute risk of MDRO abdominal infection was less than 10%, coupled with feedback and education. The primary outcome was empiric extended-spectrum antibiotic days of therapy. Safety outcomes: days to ICU transfer and hospital length of stay. Analyses compared differences between baseline and intervention periods across strategies. Among 92 hospitals with 198 480 patients, mean (SD) age was 60 (19) years and 118 723 (59.8%) were female. The trial included 93 476 and 105 004 patients hospitalized with abdominal infection during the baseline and intervention periods, respectively. Receipt of any empiric extended-spectrum antibiotics for the routine care group was 48.2% (22 519 of 46 725) during baseline and 50.5% (27 452 of 54 384) during intervention vs 47.8% (22 367 of 46 751) and 37.6% (19 010 of 50 620) for the CPOE bundle group. The group receiving CPOE prompts had a 35% relative reduction (rate ratio, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.60-0.71; P < .001) in empiric extended-spectrum antibiotic days of therapy vs routine care (raw absolute reduction between baseline and intervention periods was -169 for the CPOE bundle vs -20 for routine care).

We compared hazard of first MACE among people living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) at low-to-moderate cardiovascular risk using ABC (n = 883), TAF (n = 957), and TDF (n = 4274) at entry. Overlap weights balanced biasing factors, including age, sex at birth, atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk, CD4 count, estimated glomerular filtration rate, and anchor antiretroviral therapy. Associations between entry NRTI and MACEs were estimated using a marginal Cox proportional hazards model. Change of NRTI, or ""switching,"" was common during follow-up. Additional associations were estimated by further censoring at first switch and applying time-updated inverse probability of censoring weighting (IPCW). Baseline-adjusted associations suggest clinically relevant increases in hazard of first MACE for ABC versus TAF (hazard ratio [HR], 1.5 [95% confidence interval {CI}, .9-2.3]) and ABC versus TDF (HR, 1.4 [95% CI, .9-2.1]), but not TAF versus TDF (HR, 0.9 [95% CI, .6-1.5]).

To support the assessment of safety signals, we developed a toolkit to support COVID-19 vaccine monitoring and benefit-risk assessment. We aim to show the application of our toolkit in the EU using thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS) associated with the Vaxzevria (AstraZeneca) vaccine as a use case. In this population-based study, we used a model incorporating data from multiple EU sources such as The European Surveillance System and EudraVigilance, and estimated the benefits of COVID-19 vaccines by comparing the observed COVID-19 confirmed cases, hospitalisations, intensive care unit (ICU) admissions, and deaths across Europe to the expected numbers in the absence of Vaxzevria vaccination. Risks of TTS associated with Vaxzevria were calculated by comparing the observed number of TTS events in individuals who received Vaxzevria to the expected number of events based on background incidence rates. To visualise the results, we developed a toolkit with an interactive web application. 62 598 505 Vaxzevria vaccines (32 763 183 to females and 29 835 322 to males) had been administered in Europe by Feb 10, 2021. Our results showed that a first dose of Vaxzevria provided benefits across all age groups. Based on vaccine effectiveness estimates and reported coverage in Europe, from Dec 13, 2020 to Dec 31, 2021, vaccination with Vaxzevria was estimated to prevent (per 100 000 doses) 12 113 COVID-19 cases, 1140 hospitalisations, 184 ICU admissions, and 261 deaths. Women aged 30-59 years and males aged 20-29 years had the highest frequency of TTS events. The benefits of vaccination outweighed the risks of TTS in all age groups, with the highest benefits and risks observed in individuals aged 60-69 years. Our toolkit and underlying model contextualised the risk of TTS associated with Vaxzevria relative to its benefits. The methodology employed could be applied to other serious adverse events related to COVID-19 or other vaccines. The adaptability and versatility of such toolkits might contribute to strengthening preparedness for future public health emergencies.

40204333,Validation of predictors of successful weaning from mechanical circulatory support and histological features in lymphocytic fulminant myocarditis.,2025-04-09,Open heart,10.1136/openhrt-2025-003224,"To validate the prognostic utility of peak creatine kinase-myocardial band isoenzyme (CK-MB) level, left ventricular posterior wall diameter (LVPWD), and a score model for successful weaning from mechanical circulatory support (MCS) in fulminant myocarditis (FM). Furthermore, the severity of the histological data was stratified, and its relationship with the clinical findings was investigated. This retrospective single-centre cohort study included 20 patients with FM treated with MCS between 2013 and 2023. The primary outcome was successful weaning from MCS (MCS decannulation and survival to discharge). Two validations were conducted: Validation A, to evaluate the predictive value of peak CK-MB and LVPWD, and validation B, to evaluate the performance of the prediction model for successful MCS weaning derived from the CHANGE PUMP Study. The histological findings of 21 specimens were used for additional analyses. The pathological severity of myocardial inflammation, necrosis and oedema was stratified, and their relationship with clinical data was assessed. 14 patients were successfully weaned from MCS. In validation A, the weaning success rate was significantly higher in patients with peak CK-MB≤185 IU/L than in those with peak CK-MB>185 IU/L. Similar findings were observed in patients with LVPWD≤11 mm compared with those with LVPWD>11 mm. In Validation B, the median predictive MCS weaning success rate for the entire cohort was 80%. Compared with patients who underwent MCS decannulation successfully, those who did not had a significantly lower predictive success rate. The C-statistic of the model was 0.845. The histological severity at admission was not associated with the primary outcome. However, the CK-MB levels and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) obtained simultaneously were correlated with histological severity. Previously reported predictors of successful weaning from MCS in FM demonstrated reasonable discrimination. The severity of FM evaluated by histological findings was associated with CK-MB levels and LVEF.",,,jersey0042@gmail.com.

Piperine, a natural bioactive compound, has shown potential in inhibiting breast cancer cell growth by upregulating p53 expression. However, its clinical application is hindered by poor bioavailability, potential toxicity, and the risk of undesirable drug interactions. In the present study, a novel derivative of Piperine, YL-1-9, was synthesized and evaluated for its anticancer activity against breast cancer. YL-1-9, a bicyclic amide derivative of Piperine, was evaluated for antitumor effects both in vitro and in vivo using MTT assays and the chick embryo chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) model. Further investigations into its effects on breast cancer cell clonogenicity, adhesion, invasion, and migration were conducted through colony formation assays, EdU assays, cell adhesion and invasion studies, and wound healing experiments. Western blot analysis was performed to elucidate the effects of YL-1-9 on the cell cycle and apoptosis, which were further validated using YO-PRO-1 and propidium iodide dual staining. YL-1-9 significantly inhibited breast cancer cell proliferation, adhesion, invasion, and migration, while inducing cell cycle arrest and promoting apoptosis. Mechanistically, YL-1-9 downregulated critical proteins in the CDK4/6-cyclin D-Rb-E2F pathway and the Caspase 3/Bax/Bcl-2 apoptosis signaling pathway. These findings position YL-1-9 as a promising candidate for breast cancer therapy; however, further clinical studies are necessary to fully assess its therapeutic potential.",,,jijing@jou.edu.cn.

Despite continued advancements in GLP-1/small molecule conjugate strategies, the intracellular mechanisms facilitating concurrent GLP-1R signaling and small molecule cargo release remain poorly understood. We evaluate an estradiol (E2)-conjugated GLP-1 (GLP-1-CEX/E2) for relative differences in GLP-1R signaling and trafficking, and elucidate endolysosomal dynamics that lead to estrogenic activity using various live-cell, reporter, imaging, and mass-spectrometry techniques. We find GLP-1-CEX/E2 does not differentially activate or traffic the GLP-1R relative to its unconjugated GLP-1 backbone (GLP-1-CEX), but uniquely internalizes the E2 moiety and stimulates estrogenic signaling. Endolysosomal pH-dependent proteolytic activity likely mediates E2 moiety liberation, as evidenced by clear amplification in estrogenic activity following co-administration with lysosomal VATPase activator EN6. The hypothesized liberated metabolite from GLP-1-CEX/E2, E2-3-ether, exhibits partial estrogenic efficacy through ERα, and is predisposed toward estrone-3-sulfate conversion. Finally, we identify relative increases in intracellular E2, estrone, and estrone-3-sulfate following GLP-1-CEX/E2 incubation in GLP-1R+ cells, demonstrating proof-of-principle for desired cargo release. Together, our data suggest that GLP-1-CEX/E2 depends on GLP-1R trafficking and lysosome acidification for estrogenic efficacy, with a likely conversion of the liberated E2-3-ether metabolite into estrone-3-sulfate, resulting in a residual downstream flux into active estradiol. Our current findings aim to improve the understanding of small molecule targeting and the efficacy behind GLP-1/small molecule conjugates.",Sun N; Walch A,Analytical Pathology Unit,aaron.novikoff@helmholtz-munich.de.

In calorie-restricted, obese mice, chronic treatment with tirzepatide reduced the drop in energy expenditure that occurred in vehicle-treated and pair-fed mice, indicating that tirzepatide attenuated metabolic adaptation. Respiratory exchange ratio also decreased in tirzepatide-treated mice, indicating increased fat oxidation. In the clinical trial, tirzepatide appeared to have no impact on metabolic adaptation but led to increased fat oxidation and reductions in appetite and calorie intake during an ad libitum test meal (vs. placebo).

This study aimed to clarify the bisphosphonate compliance from the viewpoints of product selection, formulation, and patient characteristics using medical insurance claim data in Japan, to generate useful knowledge for improving bisphosphonate compliance. Bisphosphonate records for osteoporosis treatment were extracted from Japanese medical insurance claim data (2021-2023), and the Medication Possession Ratio (MPR) of each patient was calculated from the records. The calculated MPR and compliance classification (Compliant/Non-compliant/Dropout) based on dispensing status were statistically analyzed from viewpoints of drug product, dose form/frequency, and patient sex/age to investigate the influence of each factor on compliance. The mean MPR for all patients (N = 63,197) was 76.7%. Product choice influenced compliance, with significance in 230 pairs among the 71 major products. Tablet was the most compliant formulation, and compliance was better with longer dose intervals. Women showed significantly better compliance and older age was associated with better compliance. This study generated new data regarding product-specific MPRs, and clarified that product selection influences patient compliance.

Voxel-wise FW and FW-corrected fractional anisotropy (FAt) were compared between 146 BDII-D and 151 healthy controls (HCs) using FSL Randomise. Partial correlations were used to explore associations between BMI, peripheral inflammation, FW measures, and psychiatric symptoms. Moderation analysis examined the interrelationships among BMI, peripheral inflammation, and FW measures. BDII-D showed lower FAt in the genu of the corpus callosum (CC) and bilateral anterior corona radiata, and higher FW in the body of the CC compared with HCs. Higher BMI was linked to lower global FAt (q < 0.001), while higher peripheral inflammation was associated with higher global FW (q ≤ 0.01) in BDII-D. Lower FAt in the genu of the CC and higher FW in the body of CC were significantly related to higher BMI, inflammation, and greater depressive symptoms (q < 0.05). Low-grade Inflammation moderated the relationship between higher BMI and lower FAt in the genu of the CC in BDII-D (B = -3.094e-05, p < 0.001).

40198485,Multimodal Therapies for the Treatment of Neuropathic Pain: The Role of Lidocaine Patches in Combination Therapy: A Narrative Review.,,Pain and therapy,10.1007/s40122-025-00733-7,"Neuropathic pain (NP) has a population presence of up to 10%. Both systemic agents and topical agents are recommended as first-line therapy for the treatment of NP but monotherapy provides adequate pain relief only in < 50% of the cases. This has created the need for multimodal combination therapy, a practice that is becoming more common. Combination therapy with multiple systemic agents has a risk for drug-drug interactions and adverse events (AEs), while add-on therapy with a topical agent such as lidocaine patches minimizes such risks. The focus of this review was to find if there is evidence from trials that combination therapy of the topical lidocaine patches with systemic agents will have better efficacy and/or less risk of AEs than the combination of two systemic agents. Since gabapentinoids are one of the most common systemic agents used in first-line NP therapy, the objective of this review was to summarize the safety and efficacy data and evaluate the benefit-risk ratio from three gabapentinoid combinations; gabapentinoid plus opioids, gabapentinoid plus antidepressants, and gabapentinoid plus topical lidocaine patches. Reviews of clinical trials of combinations of gabapentinoids plus other systemic agents (opioids or antidepressants) were associated with increased AEs and dropouts while improvement in analgesic efficacy was inconsistent. Clinical trials where the patients were provided topical lidocaine patches when their first treatment with a gabapentinoid was inadequate demonstrated improved analgesic efficacy with minimal additional AEs. This led to the conclusion that topical lidocaine patches-associated with minimal systemic adverse effects and proven benefits in various neuropathic pain (NP) conditions-can enhance the likelihood of achieving meaningful pain relief when used as adjuvant therapy for NP.",Nalamachu S; Mallick-Searle T; Adler J; Chan EK; Borgersen W; Lissin D,Analgesic Clinical Research; Stanford Healthcare; Scilex Holding Company; Pacific Pain Medicine Consultants,dlissin@scilexholding.com.

40197832,"Development of an HEK293 Suspension Cell Culture Medium, Transient Transfection Optimization Workflow, and Analytics for Batch rAAV Manufacturing.",,Biotechnology and bioengineering,10.1002/bit.28980,"Recombinant adeno associated virus (rAAV) vectors have become popular delivery vehicles for in vivo gene therapies, but demand for rAAVs continues to outpace supply. Platform processes for rAAV production are being developed by many manufacturers, and transient chemical transfection of human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cells is currently the most popular approach. However, the cutting edge nature of rAAV process development encourages manufacturers to keep cell culture media formulations, plasmid sequences, and other details proprietary, which creates hurdles for small companies and academic labs seeking to innovate in this space. To address this problem, we leveraged the resources of an academic-industry consortium (Advanced Mammalian Biomanufacturing Innovation Center, AMBIC) to develop an rAAV production system based on transient transfection of suspension HEK293 cells adapted to an in-house, chemically defined medium. We found that balancing iron and calcium levels in the medium were crucial for maintaining transfection efficiency and minimizing cell aggregation, respectively. A design of experiments approach was used to optimize the transient transfection process for batch rAAV production, and PEI:DNA ratio and cell density at transfection were the parameters with the strongest effects on vector genome (VG) titer. When the optimized transient process was transferred between two university sites, VG titers were within a twofold range. Analytical characterization showed that purified rAAV from the AMBIC process had comparable viral protein molecular weights versus vector derived from commercial processes, but differences in transducing unit (TU) titer were observed between vector preps. The developed media formulation, transient transfection process, and analytics for VG titer, capsid identity, and TU titer constitute a set of workflows that can be adopted by others to study fundamental problems that could improve product yield and quality in the nascent field of rAAV manufacturing.",,,

This new syndrome - generally referred to as long COVID - negatively affects patients' emotional wellbeing and quality of life, and presents a major challenge for treatment providers. Considering the lack of evidence-based treatment and supports, this qualitative descriptive study explores the experiences of Canadian health and social service providers working with individuals with long COVID, as well as their suggestions for intervention development. Twenty health and social service providers between the ages of 29 and 57 across Canada completed virtual individual interviews to discuss their care experiences and service recommendations for long COVID. Participants were from a range of service sectors, including primary care, rehabilitation, mental health, and community support. Interviews were recorded, transcribed, and analyzed using codebook thematic analysis. Four themes illustrated providers' the experiences of (1) selecting personalized treatments based on patient presentation and similar conditions amidst uncertainty; and their recommendations for long COVID services, including (2) building an integrated and evidence-based model of care; (3) providing holistic support for patients and families through psychoeducation and daily living resources; and (4) caring for mental health in long COVID. Canadian health and social service providers are adopting personalized treatment approaches to address the symptom persistence of long COVID in the face of a considerable knowledge gap.

Despite the observation of these modifications across the proteome by mass spectrometry-based proteomics, an orthogonal and generalizable method to visualize the C-terminal cyclic imide would enhance detection, sensitivity, and throughput of endogenous CRBN substrate characterization. Here we develop an antibody-like reagent, termed ""cerebody,"" for visualizing and enriching C-terminal cyclic imide-modified proteins. We describe the engineering of CRBN derivatives to produce cerebody and use it to identify CRBN substrates by Western blot and enrichment from whole cell and tissue lysates. CRBN substrates identified by cerebody enrichment are mapped, validated, and further characterized for dependence on the C-terminal cyclic imide modification. These methods will accelerate the characterization of endogenous CRBN substrates and their regulation.",,,

An 11-year-old girl with a pituitary germinoma underwent chemotherapy and whole-ventricle radiotherapy (23.4 Gy in 13 fractions). At two months post-treatment, ultra-widefield scanning laser ophthalmoscopy revealed bilateral peripheral retinal vessel whitening, raising suspicion of nonperfusion areas. However, optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) confirmed preserved retinal blood flow without ischemia. Visual field testing did not reveal any abnormalities. No intervention was performed, and the whitening resolved spontaneously within two months. Unlike typical radiation retinopathy, this represents a reversible, non-ischemic process, which could be attributed to the limited radiation exposure received during whole-ventricle radiotherapy and vascular plasticity in young patients. Given that radiation retinopathy is generally considered uncommon below 45 Gy, this case presents a characteristic retinal vascular change occurring at lower radiation doses and underscores the importance of retinal evaluation even in low-dose irradiation settings. Non-invasive imaging techniques, such as OCTA and ultra-widefield scanning laser ophthalmoscopy, can be valuable for monitoring subtle radiation-induced retinal changes. Further research is needed to refine screening and management strategies for radiation-induced retinal effects.",,,

This study focuses on enhancing diffusion by creating a microporous microenvironment using gelatin microparticles within collagen scaffolds. By leveraging the FRESH (Freeform Reversible Embedding of Suspended Hydrogels) 3D bioprinting technique, gelatin microparticles are utilized both as a support material and as a thermoresponsive porogen to establish interconnected pores. The results indicate that scaffolds with 75% porosity significantly increase diffusion rates and cell viability, extending beyond the conventional ∼200 μm limit. Additionally, integrating vascular-like channels with porous scaffolds and applying perfusion improved nutrient transport, leading to enhanced cell survival in larger constructs. This combination of microporosity and perfusion represents a promising approach to create thicker tissues without necrotic regions, potentially paving the way for scalable tissue engineering applications. The findings suggest that optimizing pore sizes and scaffold perfusion can bridge the gap between rapid tissue formation and slower vascularization processes, enabling the future development of functional tissue constructs at clinically relevant scales.",,,

Patients with a history of SA (n = 11,764) were analyzed separately. Inpatient days, outpatient visits, and the amount of psychiatric medications were measured until five years after the SA. Patients with a first-time SA had four times higher psychiatric inpatient HCU (ratio 3.8 [95 % CI 3.6-4.0]) and twice higher outpatient HCU (ratio 1.7 [95 % CI 1.7-1.8]) than comparators in the year following the SA. PDU was higher for most drug classes in the SA patients, with the largest difference observed for anxiolytics and sedatives (ratio 1.9 [95 % CI 1.8-1.9]). Higher HCU and PDU in SA patients persisted throughout the five-year follow-up period. Our data did not include depressed patients from primary care, indicating that the findings may be more generalizable to patients with moderate or severe depression.

In this context, the transvenous administration of MSCs must be performed correctly under controlled standards. To support clinical practitioners, the Japanese Society for Regenerative Medicine (JSRM) formed Mesenchymal Stromal Cells Infusion Working Group and developed a proposal on the management standards that should be followed by medical practitioners in the implementation of regenerative medicine regarding the transvenous administration of MSCs. This review provides a comprehensive framework for the appropriate explanation of intravenous MSC administration to patients, including detailed discussions on the associated risks, protocols for addressing potential complications during administration, and strategies for ensuring patient safety. Particular emphasis is placed on the precautions and preparations necessary to mitigate the risk of fat embolism during MSC administration. The review outlines methods for patient monitoring to prevent such adverse events, protocols for responding effectively if a fat embolism occurs, and best practices for the handling of mesenchymal stem cells to minimize the likelihood of complications. Additionally, it includes recommendations for post-administration patient observation to enhance safety and efficacy. This review further incorporates a detailed checklist aimed at facilitating safe and effective MSC administration. It emphasizes the need for implementers to exercise the highest standards of care throughout the process. By addressing key practical and safety concerns, this review aims to serve as a valuable resource for ensuring the secure and reliable application of MSC therapies in clinical practice.

Relugolix, a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) receptor antagonist, is the only oral ADT, with limited real-world data on therapy persistence and adherence. This retrospective study evaluates persistence and adherence of relugolix, degarelix, and GnRH agonists (leuprolide, goserelin, triptorelin, histrelin) using data from the IBM MarketScan Research Database (Jan 2017 - Dec 2022). The IBM MarketScan Research Database (1 January 2017 - 31 December 2022) was used for enrollment history and claims. ADT adherence was measured by the proportion of days covered (PDC) at 3, 6, and 12 months, calculated as days on ADT divided by period duration. Kaplan-Meier analysis assessed treatment persistence by measuring time to treatment discontinuation. Relugolix had higher adherence (PDC ≥ 80%) at 12 months (60.8%) compared to degarelix (13.0%) and GnRH agonists (46.3%). Median time to discontinuation was also longer for relugolix (13.5 months) than degarelix (3.1 months) and GnRH agonists (8.8 months).

Prostate cancer is the second most common cancer among men in the US. Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), a key treatment for advanced prostate cancer, lowers testosterone levels, a hormone that helps prostate cancer grow.  ADT includes injectable gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) receptor agonists like leuprolide, which initially raise testosterone before lowering it, and antagonists like degarelix, (injectable) and relugolix (oral), which rapidly lower testosterone. A large clinical trial (phase III) showed relugolix rapidly and consistently lowered testosterone, with similar side effects to leuprolide but fewer major cardiovascular events (nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, and death from any cause).There is limited published real-world data, including healthcare information like medical records and insurance claims, on how well patients stay on treatment (persistence) and take their medication as prescribed (adherence) for different forms of ADT, especially oral relugolix.Data from the IBM MarketScan Research Database (January 2017 to December 2022) was used to compare persistence and adherence among patients taking oral relugolix, injectable degarelix, and injectable GnRH receptor agonists.Patients taking relugolix had a higher rate of adherence to their treatment (60.8%) after 12 months versus those receiving injectable degarelix (13.0%) and other injectables, GnRH receptor agonists (46.3%). Patients on relugolix also stayed on their treatment longer (13.5 months) compared to those on injectable degarelix (3.1 months) and GnRH receptor agonists (8.8 months). These results were especially notable in patients with metastatic prostate cancer.This study demonstrates favorable persistence and adherence rates with oral relugolix in patients receiving ADT for advanced prostate cancer.",Hong A; Ryan MJ; Romdhani H; Kinkead F; Flanders SC,Sumitomo Pharma America; Analysis Group; Pfizer Inc,

This technology is particularly valuable as it allows researchers to quickly adjust the structure and composition of dosage forms and efficiently evaluate multiple formulations for safety and efficacy. The following research explores the feasibility of using the direct powder extrusion (DPE) technique to produce 3D-printed mini tablets for eventual in vivo preclinical trials in rodents. The DPE method streamlines the manufacturing process into a single step and addresses the limitations commonly associated with Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM). It offers advantages such as customized small-batch production, optimized costs, and minimal waste. This allows pharmaceutical companies to quickly respond to market demands and improve overall product quality through detailed characterization. In this study cellulose-based polymers like Hydroxypropyl Cellulose (HPC-L) and Hydroxypropyl Methylcellulose (HPMC-15LV) were selected as the main matrix excipients, incorporating 10 % w/w of a model drug. The formulations were further optimized to achieve the best flowability and extrudability, as well as the most desirable printing resolution, to produce 3D-printed mini tablets resembling size 9 capsules. Based on the inner diameter of the cannula used for oral administration in rats, tablets measuring 8.6 × 1.8 × 1.8 mm were successfully printed. Thermal analysis (DSC and TGA) and solid-state characterization (FTIR, XRD) were employed to evaluate the physical properties of the powder blends and final 3D-printed products along with the assessment of desirable mechanical features. The successful production of small batches of model 3D-printed mini tablets that are suitable for in vivo testing and present comparable release profiles with conventional employed capsules demonstrated the possibility to implement DPE during preclinical development of novel formulations working independently from suppliers.",Angelis D; Balducci AG; Amadei F,Chiesi Farmaceutici Spa,luca.casettari@uniurb.it.

While WHF has traditionally been managed through hospitalization, recent approaches are shifting toward outpatient care to maximize patient time spent at home and optimize allocation of hospital resources. Emerging treatments like subcutaneous furosemide and intranasal bumetanide offer promising alternatives for safe, well-tolerated, and effective diuresis outside the hospital. However, these novel strategies face several challenges, including the need for clinician/staff training, patient education, logistical difficulties, and a lack of evidence in diverse populations. To ensure equitable management, it is also essential to address healthcare disparities, particularly in socioeconomically disadvantaged and rural populations.

However, access to diverse chemical sets of cyclic peptides is difficult on a large library scale. DNA-encoded Chemical Libraries (DELs) provide a suitable tool to obtain large chemical diversity, but cyclic DELs made by standard DEL implementation cannot efficiently explore their conformational diversity. On the other hand, dual-display Encoded Self-Assembling Chemical (ESAC) Libraries can be used for modulating macrocycle flexibility since the two displayed peptides can be connected in an incremental fashion. In this work, we construct a 56 million dual-display ESAC library using a two-step cyclization strategy.

We report clinical, patient-reported, safety, and radiographic outcomes after 48 weeks. Oral group received methotrexate plus oral prednisolone (20.0 mg/d, tapered rapidly, discontinued week 36); Injection group received triple therapy (methotrexate, sulphasalazine, hydroxychloroquine) and mandatory intra-articular glucocorticoid injections. The primary end point was analysed by logistic regression with several approaches for handling missing outcomes. In total, 137 and 80 patients were included in the oral group and injection group; 78% vs. 89% completed, respectively. At 48 weeks, adjusted clinical disease activity index remission ≤2.8 rates (95% CI) were 36% (28-44) and 55% (42-68), respectively; the risk difference (primary outcome) was 19% (2-35). Similarly, key secondary clinical, patient-reported and safety outcomes showed numerically better results in the injection group vs oral group, for example, infections occurred in 53% vs 30%, respectively. Radiographic progression (Δtotal van der Heijde-modified Sharp Score) was low: oral group: adjusted mean, 0.26 (95% CI, 0.08-0.43); injection group: adjustedd mean, 0.80 (95% CI, 0.55-1.05). Cumulative dose of oral/intra-articular glucocorticoids (median) was 1905 mg prednisolone for the oral group and 165 mg for the injection group. In treatment-naïve patients with early rheumatoid arthritis, triple therapy and mandatory glucocorticoid joint injections had numerically better clinical outcomes, fewer withdrawals, fewer adverse events, and lower cumulative dose of glucocorticoids, but slightly worse radiographic outcomes than treatment with methotrexate and oral prednisolone. These findings, although nonrandomised, suggest a potential for optimising treatment strategy with conventional therapies in early rheumatoid arthritis.",,,merete.hetland.01@regionh.dk.

However, a problem faced by the CRISPR/Cas12a system when directly used for trace detection is the linear amplification efficiency of single-cycle digestion. Here, we present a novel hairpin reporter-driven CRISPR/Cas12a (HR-CRISPR) amplification system that establishes a positive feedback loop within the CRISPR/Cas12a platform to finish an exponential and sensitive signal amplification in a one-step reaction. As proof of concept, we applied this strategy to the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) activity assay without pre-amplification procedure. The polyT strand extended by TdT hybridizes with crRNA, activating Cas12a, which then cleaves the FQ-hairpin reporter. The cleavage products are further elongated by reverse transcriptase using crRNA as a template, reactivating Cas12a and producing exponentially amplified fluorescence signals. This assay offers a simple yet highly sensitive approach for quantifying TdT activity, achieving a low detection limit of 4.55 × 10",,,dianmingzhou@foxmail.com.

Despite such clinical significance, the structural basis of urate recognition and transport by GLUT9 remains elusive. Here, we present the cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of GLUT9 in the inward-open conformation in both apo and urate-bound states. Urate binds in a cleft between the N-terminal and C-terminal domains, interacting via hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions. Structural comparison with sugar-transporting GLUTs highlights unique amino acid compositions in the substrate recognition pocket of GLUT9. Functional and mutational studies directly measuring GLUT9-mediated urate uptake further demonstrate the cooperative roles of multiple residues in urate recognition.

This study aimed to investigate the effects of exercise training and supplementation (milk thistle, chicory and cumin) on liver metabolites related to its function and health in rats with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Forty adult male Wistar rats with an average weight of 215 ± 10 g were divided into a control group fed on the basal diet and four experimental groups fed with high-fat diet (HFD) for 6 weeks to induce non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). The 4 NAFLD groups were subdivided and treated with (a) plain HFD, (b) high-intensity interval training (HIIT), (c) supplement (milk thistle, chicory, and cumin), and (d) combined HIIT and supplementation for 4 weeks. The induction of NAFLD through HFD yielded dyslipidemia, liver tissue damage, increased malondialdehyde, uncoupling protein 2 (UCP2), and phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K), as well as decreased superoxide dismutase (SOD) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma co-activator 1 alpha (PGC-1α) in liver tissue (p < 0.05).

The present study aims to describe experiences with Mpox-related sexual behaviors, stigma, and vaccine barriers and facilitators among a sample of BLSMM living in both California and New York. In this qualitative interpretive phenomenological study, we utilized semi-structured individual interviews as the primary source for data collection. Data was collected between August 2021 and December 2022 from 41 adult participants in California and New York. Interviews were recorded, transcribed verbatim, and analyzed using thematic content analysis. Participants ranged in age from 19 to 65 years, with the majority identifying as Black (73%) and male gender (93%). Overall, participants' narratives revealed that initial messaging around Mpox produced stigma parallel to the HIV/AIDS pandemic with many participants curtailing their sexual behaviors as a harm reduction strategy. Mpox-related stigma negatively impacted sexual minority communities both internally and externally. Participants' narratives also revealed general vaccine skepticism due to existing medical distrust, negative vaccine experiences by other BLSMM, and lack of prioritization of outreach and distribution efforts in communities of color. Alterations to vaccine administration protocols and outreach efforts for reasons identified in this study are critical to addressing disparities in vaccine uptake among BLSMM.

As accessible proxies for processes that are difficult to measure, biomarkers are tools that hold increasingly important roles in drug development and clinical trial decision making. In the past few years, biomarkers have been the basis for accelerated approval of new therapies for Alzheimer disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis as surrogate end points reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit.Blood-based biomarkers are emerging for Alzheimer disease and other neurodegenerative disorders (for example, Parkinson disease, frontotemporal dementia), and some biomarkers may be informative across multiple disease states. Collection of CSF provides access to biomarkers not available in plasma, including markers of synaptic dysfunction and neuroinflammation. Molecular imaging is identifying an increasing array of targets, including amyloid plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, inflammation, mitochondrial dysfunction and synaptic density. In this Review, we consider how biomarkers can be implemented in clinical trials depending on their context of use, including providing information on disease risk and/or susceptibility, diagnosis, prognosis, pharmacodynamic outcomes, monitoring, prediction of response to therapy and safety.

The bacteriostatic properties of nanoemulsion and storage stability at different temperatures were first investigated. The results showed that the B/S-NE prepared in this study had a good inhibitory effect on P. aeruginosa and B. thermosphacta. And B/S-NE has good storage stability (particle size <165 nm, zeta potential > -20 mV, release rate < 30 %) at 4 °C compared to 25 °C. When applied to beef preservation, it was found that beef treated with the B/S-NE coating maintained good color, pH, and texture, and significantly inhibited lipid and protein oxidation as well as microbial growth compared to the control group (P < 0.05). In addition, high-throughput sequencing analysis showed that Pseudomonas was apparently the main spoilage bacteria during beef storage. While B/S-NE significantly inhibited the growth of spoilage bacteria and reduced microbial diversity during storage. These results suggest that the B/S-NE coating can be used as an antioxidant and preservative, and has good application potential in the preservation and anticorrosion of chilled beef.",Han G; Tong L,Shandong Lvrun Foods Co.; Inner Mongolia Horqin Cattle Industry Co.,zlwlzyc@163.com.

From a personalized treatment perspective, evaluating functional improvements by illness severity is crucial. This study investigated changes in cerebral hemodynamics before and after six weeks of rTMS treatment in 45 patients with depression, using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). The aim was to assess changes in hemodynamics according to the severity of depressive symptoms, as classified by the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D 17). Prior to treatment, patients with higher severity (HAM-D 17 score ≥ 24) exhibited significantly reduced blood flow in brain regions such as the frontopolar area, and dorsolateral and inferior prefrontal areas compared to patients with lower severity. After six weeks of rTMS treatment, a significant increase in hemodynamic response was observed in the frontopolar cortex and left lateral frontal regions. Moreover, a significant increase in hemodynamic response was noted in the frontopolar cortex in both the mild and severe groups, compared to the moderate group. Notably, patients exhibiting increased hemodynamics parameters also demonstrated significant improvements in depressive symptoms, as reflected by reductions in HAM-D scores. These findings suggest a potential correlation between rTMS-induced hemodynamic changes in the frontal region and improved treatment outcomes. Furthermore, the results imply that rTMS may promote neuroplasticity in specific brain regions, thereby contributing to the alleviation of depressive symptoms.",,,tk@ompu.ac.jp.

Here, we pathologically investigated plexin D1 expression in the SCs of patients with sporadic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (sALS) to clarify the association between plexin D1 expression in ECs and MN degeneration. We measured plexin D1 expression in the ECs of lumbar SC tissue samples from 11 patients with sALS and 8 age- and sex-matched patients with other non-inflammatory neurological diseases (OND) by immunohistochemistry. Additionally, the number and percentage of plexin D1-positive MNs in lumbar MNs were assessed in each case. We also evaluated the immunoreactivity of TAR DNA binding protein (TARDBP) in plexin D1-positive MNs. Immunohistochemistry showed that there was no obvious difference in plexin D1 expression in ECs between sALS and OND cases. Unexpectedly, plexin D1 accumulation was greater in MNs of patients with sALS compared with those with OND. The number and percentage of plexin D1-positive MNs in patients with sALS were significantly greater than in patients with OND (median [interquartile range], 6 [1-11] vs. 1 [0-3.3], p = 0.0349; and 12.9 % [5.5-15.5] vs. 1.1 % [0-3.5], p = 0.0032, respectively). Plexin D1-positive MNs showed TARDBP cytoplasmic mislocalization and aggregation. Plexin D1 was similarly expressed in ECs between sALS and OND cases, but accumulated in the degenerated MNs of patients with sALS.

However, due to the exploratory nature and small sample size, the efficacy of ABCP post-EGFR-TKI failure is still debated. We evaluated ABCP therapy against other platinum-based regimens without immune checkpoint inhibitors in terms of effectiveness and toxicity. Data from patients with advanced or recurrent NSCLC harboring EGFR-sensitizing mutations treated with platinum-based chemotherapy or ABCP at five Japanese hospitals were retrospectively analyzed. Propensity score matching compared efficacy outcomes, including overall response rate (ORR), PFS, and OS. Of 183 EGFR mutation carriers, 33 underwent ABCP therapy, while 150 received platinum-based chemotherapy. Following propensity score matching, 32 and 74 patients were analyzed. In the ABCP group, median PFS and OS were 6.8 and 16.7 months compared to 5.8 and 25.7 months with platinum-based chemotherapy, showing no significant differences in PFS (p = 0.46) and OS (p = 0.85).

40184165,Achieving epilepsy care for all: Ecosystem-based transformation.,,Epilepsia,10.1111/epi.18400,"Epilepsy exemplifies many of the systemic challenges of modern health care-fragmented care delivery, inequitable access, financial strain, and so on. The current ""system of systems"" (SoS) structure of U.S. health care fosters siloed operations among its member systems (e.g., insurers, health care institutions, providers, researchers, pharmaceutical companies, and technology vendors), failing to address interconnected issues like care continuity, clinician burnout, and appropriate resource allocation. This article proposes embracing a health care ecosystem approach as a solution, emphasizing interdependence, collaboration, and equity. Section 1 examines the shortcomings of the current care model, with a focus on its financial challenges and the systemic inefficiencies it perpetuates. Section 2 explains the concept of a health care ecosystem and its potential to drive equity through organic coordination and collective accountability. It highlights the role of key member systems-patients, advocacy groups, professional organizations, health care providers, payers, purchasers, policymakers, researchers, and industry leaders-in achieving equity in brain health care. Finally, Section 3 presents a roadmap for transitioning from SoS to ecosystem, outlining multiple actionable strategies, such as enhancing advocacy and data sharing by professional organizations, adopting integrated and multidisciplinary care models by health care providers, and prioritizing affordability and collaboration by industry leaders. Policymakers and federal research organizations can support the transition by incentivizing collaboration, expanding funding for health services research, and supporting data-driven decision-making. Advocacy groups can amplify collective voices and help prioritize improvement opportunities. Using epilepsy care as an example condition, this article argues that coordinated, multi-sector, and multi-level efforts can successfully and efficiently address systemic challenges, improve outcomes, and reduce inequities. It offers a replicable framework for achieving sustainable, scalable, and equitable care for chronic neurological conditions.",Martin Lee B,Epilepsy Foundation of America,

40183418,Preoperative medical therapy before surgery for uterine fibroids.,2025-04-04,The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,10.1002/14651858.CD000547.pub3,"Uterine fibroids occur in up to 40% of women over 35 years of age. Up to 50% of uterine fibroids cause symptoms that warrant treatment: anaemia caused by heavy menstrual bleeding, pelvic pain, dysmenorrhoea, infertility and poor quality of life. Surgery is the first choice of treatment, but medical therapies have been used prior to surgery to improve outcomes. Gonadotropin-hormone-releasing analogues (GnRHa) induce a low-oestrogen state that shrinks fibroids, but they have unacceptable side effects if used long-term. Other potential hormonal treatments include progestins and selective progesterone-receptor modulators (SPRMs). This updates a Cochrane review published in 2017. To assess the benefits and risks of medical treatments prior to surgery for uterine fibroids. We searched the Cochrane Gynaecology and Fertility Group Specialized Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO and CINAHL on 8 August 2024. We also searched trials registers (ClinicalTrials.gov; WHO ICTRP), theses and dissertations, and grey literature, as well as handsearching reference lists of retrieved articles and contacting pharmaceutical companies. We included randomised controlled trials of premenopausal women receiving medical therapy before myomectomy, hysterectomy or hysteroscopic resection for uterine fibroids versus placebo, no pretreatment or another medical therapy. We used standard Cochrane methods. We assessed the certainty of the evidence using GRADE. We included 41 RCTs, which involved 3982 women. Thirty-six studies evaluated GnRHa: the comparators were no pretreatment (19 studies), placebo (9 studies), or other medical pretreatments (progestin, SPRMs, selective oestrogen receptor modulators (SERMs), dopamine agonists, oestrogen receptor antagonists) (8 studies). Five studies evaluated SPRMs versus placebo. Most results provided low-certainty evidence due to poor reporting of randomisation procedures, lack of blinding, imprecision and inconsistency. Some outcomes were not measured or did not have usable data. The use of ulipristal acetate (an SPRM) is suspended at this time (March 2025) because of an association with cases of liver failure. GnRHa versus placebo or no pretreatment before surgery for uterine fibroids GnRHa pretreatment may reduce uterine volume (mean difference (MD) -175.34 mL, 95% confidence interval (CI) -219.04 to -131.65; 13 studies, 858 participants; I² = 67%; low-certainty evidence) and fibroid volume (MD range 5.7 mL to 155.4 mL; 5 studies to heterogeneous to pool, 427 participants; low-certainty evidence), and probably increases preoperative haemoglobin (MD 0.88 g/dL, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.08; 10 studies, 834 participants; I² = 0%; moderate-certainty evidence). However, there is probably a greater likelihood of adverse events with GnRHa (odds ratio (OR) 2.78, 95% CI 1.77 to 4.36; 5 studies, 755 participants; I² = 28%; moderate-certainty evidence). No usable data were available for preoperative bleeding. Hysterectomy Duration of hysterectomy may be reduced amongst women who receive GnRHa treatment (-10.11 minutes, 95% CI -16.96 to -3.25; 6 studies, 617 participants; I² = 57%; low-certainty evidence). Results are uncertain for intraoperative blood loss (4 heterogeneous studies, 258 participants; MD range 25 mL to 148 mL, in favour of GnRHa; very low-certainty evidence). There are probably fewer blood transfusions with GnRHa (OR 0.54, 95% CI 0.29 to 1.01; 6 studies, 601 participants; I² = 0%; moderate-certainty evidence) and less postoperative morbidity (OR 0.54, 95% CI 0.32 to 0.91; 7 studies, 772 participants; I² = 28%; moderate-certainty evidence). Myomectomy There is uncertainty about the effects of GnRHa pretreatment on surgery duration (7 heterogeneous studies, 443 participants) (very low-certainty evidence) and intraoperative blood loss during myomectomy (11 studies too heterogenous to pool, 549 participants; very low-certainty evidence). GnRHa may make little to no difference to blood transfusions (OR 0.85, 95% CI 0.26 to 2.75; 4 studies, 121 participants; I² = 0%; low-certainty evidence) or postoperative morbidity (OR 1.07, 95% CI 0.43 to 2.64; I² = 0%; 5 studies, 190 participants; low-certainty evidence). Hysteroscopic resection GnRHa treatment before hysteroscopic resection of uterine myomas may result in little to no difference in surgery duration (2 studies,123 participants; low-certainty evidence). One study reported no cases of postoperative morbidity in either group (84 participants; low-certainty evidence). GnRHa versus other medical therapies before surgery - preoperative outcomes GnRHa may be associated with a greater reduction in uterine volume than other medical therapies (-47% compared to -20% and -22% with 5 mg and 10 mg ulipristal acetate, respectively; low-certainty evidence). There may be little to no difference in bleeding reduction (ulipristal acetate 5 mg: OR 0.71, 95% CI 0.30 to 1.68; 1 study, 199 participants; low-certainty evidence), and there is probably little to no difference in preoperative haemoglobin (MD -0.02, 95% CI -0.41 to 0.37; 242 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). We are uncertain whether there is any difference in fibroid volume between GnRHa and cabergoline (MD 12.71 mL, 95% CI -5.92 to 31.34; 2 studies, 110 participants; I² = 0%; low-certainty evidence). Adverse events such as hot flushes may be more likely with GnRHa (OR 2.83, 95% CI 1.68 to 4.77; 6 studies, 507 participants; I² = 59%; low-certainty evidence). SPRMs versus placebo before surgery - preoperative outcomes SPRMs (mifepristone, CDB-2914, ulipristal acetate and asoprisnil) before surgery probably reduce uterine volume (2 heterogenous studies, 275 participants; moderate-certainty evidence) and may reduce fibroid volume (5 heterogeneous studies, 451 participants; low-certainty evidence). SPRMs probably increase preoperative haemoglobin (MD 0.93 g/dL, 95% CI 0.52 to 1.34; 2 studies, 173 participants; I² = 0%; moderate-certainty evidence), and they may reduce bleeding before surgery (ulipristal acetate 5 mg: OR 41.41, 95% CI 15.26 to 112.38; 1 study, 143 participants; asoprisnil: MD -166.9 mL; 95% CI -277.60 to -56.20; 1 study, 22 participants; low-certainty evidence). Results were very imprecise for adverse events (low-certainty evidence). Pretreatment with gonadotropin-hormone-releasing analogues may reduce uterine and fibroid volume and probably increases preoperative haemoglobin levels, but probably also increases the number of adverse events. Blood transfusions and operation time during hysterectomy may be reduced, with fewer women experiencing postoperative morbidity. SPRMs, such as ulipristal acetate, seem to offer similar advantages: they probably reduce uterine volume and increase haemoglobin level before surgery, and may reduce fibroid volume and fibroid-related bleeding. However, replication of these studies is advised as the certainty of the evidence is moderate to low.",,,

This study assessed the immunogenicity and efficacy of a reverse-genetics-derived, Differentiating Infected from Vaccinated Animals (DIVA)-compatible inactivated H5N8 vaccine based on the IDCDC-RG71A strain. The vaccine was formulated with different adjuvants, including Montanide ISA 78 VG, ISA 71 R VG, GEL P PR, and mannose-conjugated chitosan nanoparticles, and administered via either the subcutaneous (SC) or intranasal (IN) route. To evaluate safety, the vaccine was tested in specific antibody negative (SAN) chickens, showing no adverse effects. Immunogenicity was assessed by measuring hemagglutination inhibition (HI) antibody titers, antigen-specific IgA and IgY levels, and CD4+ and CD8+ T cell proliferation. Vaccine efficacy was determined through a challenge study using a field isolate of H5N1. This showed that a single SC dose of vaccine containing ISA 78 VG or ISA 71 R VG provided the best efficacy against infection, with high survival rates, control of abnormally high temperature incidence, reduced virus shedding, and reduced lung and liver lesions. The ISA 78 VG-adjuvanted SC vaccine induced the highest HI titers and CD4+ T cell proliferation, while ISA 71 R VG and GEL P PR elicited the strongest IgY responses. In contrast, IN formulations induced IgA in the lungs and trachea however, even after two doses, failed to generate high HI titers and provided poor, if any, protection against infection. This highlights the superior efficacy of the SC over the IN route of vaccination for reducing H5N1 viral shedding. These results underscore the importance of both the adjuvants and delivery route to maximize HPAI vaccine efficacy. This presented system could thereby be used to develop potent and DIVA-compatible vaccines to enhance biosecurity and disease management in regions affected by endemic HPAI.",Petrovsky N,Vaxine Pty Ltd,

Their rapid spread, amplified by social media algorithms and digital misinformation networks, exacerbates public health challenges, highlighting the urgency of understanding their prevalence, key drivers, and mitigation strategies. This scoping review synthesizes research on health-related conspiracy theories, focusing on their prevalence, impacts on health behaviors and outcomes, contributing factors, and counter-measures. Using Arksey and O'Malley's framework and the Joanna Briggs Institute guidelines, a systematic search of six databases (PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, CINAHL, PsycINFO, and Scopus) was conducted. Studies were screened using predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria, with thematic synthesis categorizing findings across diverse health contexts. The review revealed pervasive conspiracy beliefs surrounding HIV/AIDS, vaccines, pharmaceutical companies, and COVID-19, linked to reduced vaccine uptake, increased mistrust in health authorities, and negative mental health outcomes such as anxiety and depression. Key drivers included sociopolitical distrust, cognitive biases, low scientific literacy, and the unchecked proliferation of misinformation on digital platforms. Promising countermeasures included inoculation messaging, media literacy interventions, and two-sided refutational techniques. However, their long-term effectiveness remains uncertain, as few studies assess their sustained impact across diverse sociopolitical contexts.

A recent in-center clinical study using the Carry Life UF system demonstrated higher ultrafiltration (UF) rates, more efficient use of glucose (increased UF volume/gram of glucose absorbed), and greater sodium removal with the Carry Life UF treatments compared with a 2.27% glucose continuous ambulatory PD (CAPD) dwell. The aim of this study is to compare efficacy and safety of the Carry Life UF system with a standard CAPD prescription in the home setting. A prospective, multicenter, randomized, crossover study of 19 adult subjects at up to 12 sites in Italy, Sweden and the UK will complete the investigation. End-stage kidney disease patients with a CAPD prescription of 2-4 exchanges per day, including at least one 2.27% glucose dwell, will be included. After a Carry Life UF glucose dose determination phase performed in-clinic, subjects will be randomized to start the home treatment part of the study with either the control arm (2.27% glucose CAPD dwell) or the Carry Life UF arm (11 or 15 g/h glucose dose), each for four weeks. The primary endpoint is UF volume comparing the control CAPD 2.27% glucose dwell with the Carry Life UF treatment. Secondary endpoints include adverse event rates, peritoneal sodium removal, glucose UF efficiency, and peak dialysate glucose concentration. This study will evaluate a novel PD technology in the home environment. Challenging aspects include the need to accurately measure UF volumes at home and to support subjects in using a novel technology. The study design considers important parameters for precise UF volume measurements and provides detailed weighing instructions to the study team to ensure consistency between study centers. Research nursing support will be provided for training of subjects and to support endpoint data collection in the subjects' home. Due to the significant burden associated with the study, subjects will be offered a fair compensation, in accordance with local regulations.

40181240,Proceedings of the 15,2025-04-04,mAbs,10.1080/19420862.2025.2487604,"The European Immunogenicity Platform (EIP) celebrated the 15th edition of its Open Symposium on Immunogenicity of Biopharmaceuticals and its associated one-day workshop on 22-24 February 2024 in Lisbon. The meeting attracted experts and newcomers across industry, regulatory agencies, and academia, who actively participated in 3 days of discussion on risk assessment, monitoring, and mitigation of unwanted immunogenicity of biologics. Besides oral presentations, poster sessions were held to maximize scientific exchange and networking opportunities. Therapeutic proteins and emerging gene and cell-based therapies present promising therapeutic options for addressing unmet medical needs or when conventional treatment approaches have failed. Nonetheless, the development of an immune response against these therapeutic agents is a significant concern, as it occurs in a considerable number of cases across various products and indications. The specific anti-drug antibodies that develop can lead to adverse safety events, inhibition of drug activity, or accelerated clearance, all of which result in a loss of treatment efficacy. The EIP serves as a forum for experts and newcomers in the immunogenicity field, fostering discussion among scientists from industry and academia, encouraging interactions with regulatory agencies, and disseminating knowledge and advancements in immunogenicity sciences to the broader scientific community. This report covers the main topics discussed during the EIP 15th Open Symposium on Immunogenicity of Biopharmaceuticals, and the one-day workshop on practical aspects of immunogenicity held prior to the conference. Key topics included immunogenicity testing, clinical relevance of immunogenicity, immunogenicity risk assessment and mitigation, and current regulatory considerations.",Tourdot S; Bloem K; Champion L; De Groot AS; Garidel P; Grudzinska-Goebel J; Gutknecht M; Hickling T; Horling F; Ichetovkin M; Johnson A; Jyamubandi I; Karle A; Kromminga A; Kurtulmus EA; Loeff F; Maillere B; Michaut L; Minelli F; Nayak V; Nelson R; Pattyn S; Pepermans E; Poyau A; Reichel M; Rosenberg A; Saxena M; Smith N; Snoeck V; Thoo L; Tovey M; Wuttke R; Yerly D; Kramer D,Drug Metabolism and Pharmacokinetics; In Vitro Immunology; EpiVax; Resolian Bioanalytics; BioAgilitix Europe GmbH; NBE-DMPK Innovative BioAnalytics; PK Sciences - Translational Medicine; Adverse Drug Reaction - Analysis & Consulting; Research & Development Department; Preclinical Development; Sanquin Diagnostic Services; PK Sciences; BioNTech SE; IU-TIP; Immunogenicity and Mechanistic Immunology; Bioanalytical Services; Chief Scientific Advisor Svar Life Science AB; Translational Medicine Unit; Lonza; Département Médicaments et Technologies pour la Santé; LBA Method Development; R&D; Pharma Research and Early Development; ImmuneSpec; Pharmacokinetics; Translational Medicine; Precision Medicine; BioAgilytix Europe,

Subjects are enrolled in 43 sites across 5 continents. The assessments include domains similar to those acquired in previous CHR studies along with novel domains that are collected longitudinally across a period of 2 years. In parallel with the data acquisition, multidisciplinary teams of experts have been working to formulate the data analysis strategy for the AMP SCZ project. Here, we describe the key principles for the data analysis. The primary AMP SCZ analysis aim is to use baseline clinical assessments and multimodal biomarkers to predict clinical endpoints of CHR individuals. These endpoints are defined for the AMP SCZ study as transition to psychosis (i.e., conversion), remission from CHR syndrome, and persistent CHR syndrome (non-conversion/non-remission) obtained at one year and two years after baseline assessment. The secondary aim is to use longitudinal clinical assessments and multimodal biomarkers from all time points to identify clinical trajectories that differentiate subgroups of CHR individuals. The design of the analysis plan is informed by reviewing legacy data and the analytic approaches from similar international CHR studies. In addition, we consider properties of the newly acquired data that are distinct from the available legacy data. Legacy data are used to assist analysis pipeline building, perform benchmark experiments, quantify clinical concepts and to make design decisions meant to overcome the challenges encountered in previous studies. We present the analytic design of the AMP SCZ project, mitigation strategies to address challenges related to the analysis plan, provide rationales for key decisions, and present examples of how the legacy data have been used to support design decisions for the analysis of the multimodal and longitudinal data.

We aimed to describe the frequency and persistence of biological drug use in older patients (≥ 65 years) with IMID, including inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs), psoriatic arthritis/psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and ankylosing spondylitis, in a large Italian population. A retrospective cohort study using the VALORE distributed claims database network from 13 Italian regions in the years 2010-2022 was performed. Older patients with IMID receiving biological drugs were included. Yearly prevalence of biological drug use and treatment persistence among incident users, from first dispensing to discontinuation/switching to another drug, was measured. Multivariable logistic regression was employed to identify treatment discontinuation predictors. The prevalence of biological drug use in older patients with IMID increased dramatically from 2010 (0.44 per 1000 residents) to 2022 (2.48 per 1000 residents). Overall, 25,284 incident users of biological drugs were identified, with a female/male ratio of 1.6 and a mean age of 71.0 (standard deviation ± 5.2) years. The median duration of follow-up was 4.2 (2.5-6.6) years, and the most common indication for use was RA (n = 8371; 33.1%). Overall, biological drug persistence was 54.4% at 1 year from treatment start. The highest persistence rates were found for vedolizumab and ustekinumab in patients with IBD (ulcerative colitis, 68.1% and 76.2%, respectively; Crohn's disease, 69.6% and 88.1%, respectively). Polypharmacy, advanced age, and female sex were identified as predictors of treatment discontinuation. This study documented a significant rise in biological drug use among older patients with IMID in Italy over the last decade. Around 50% of users discontinued treatment after the first year, with even higher rates observed in very old patients with polypharmacy. These findings highlight potential concerns about the use of biological therapies in older patients and underscore the urgent need for large-scale cohort studies to address the current knowledge gaps regarding their safety and effectiveness in this vulnerable population.",Leoni O; Zanforlini M; Ancona D; Stella P; Cavazzana A; Scapin A; Lopes S; Belleudi V; Ledda S; Carta P; Scarpelli RF; Allotta A; Pollina SA; Bucaneve G; Mangano AMP; Balducci F; Sorrentino C; Senesi I; Gini R,Azienda Zero; Abruzzo Regional Centre of Pharmacovigilance; Regione Autonoma della Sardegna; Umbria Regional Centre of Pharmacovigilance; Azienda Regionale per l'Innovazione e gli Acquisti; Epidemiologic Observatory of the Sicily Regional Health Service; Agenzia regionale sanitaria della regione Marche; Lombardy Regional Epidemiologic Observatory; Regional Pharmaceutical Unit; Dipartimento Salute e Welfare; Department of Epidemiology; Agenzia Regionale di Sanità Toscana; Centro Regionale Farmacovigilanza Regione Puglia,gianluca.trifiro@univr.it.

The protein aggregates and insoluble particles form during manufacturing and storage, and should be characterized to optimize the manufacturing process and establish a control strategy. Several issues regarding the evaluation and control of these particles have been concerned, and collaborative studies have been conducted in the Japan Biopharmaceutical Consortium to address them. However, there is still no consensus for utilizing analytical techniques in parallel to establish a control strategy for such protein aggregates and insoluble particles, which range in size from a few nanometers to several hundred micrometers. Therefore, in this study, we surveyed Japanese biopharmaceutical companies through a questionnaire including questions regarding analytical techniques used to establish control strategies for protein aggregates and insoluble particles at various development phases. To summary the survey results, we found that size exclusion chromatography, light obscuration, and visual inspection are consistently used from early development and formulation optimization stage to commercial manufacturing. Apart from the light obscuration method, flow imaging (FI) was the most commonly used technique for subvisible particle characterization; thus, the use of FI to establish a control strategy was documented. The recommendation for establishing a control strategy for protein aggregates and insoluble particles based on life-cycle of drug development are summarized.",Saitoh S; Hayashi Y; Inaba K; Katsura S; Sakurai M; Komine Y; Okabe S; Kito H; Nakano M; Miyamoto K; Maruyama A; Miyahara Y; Noda M; Shimbo K,Formulation Research Biologics and Injectables Development; Analytical & Quality Evaluation Research Laboratories; Research Division; U-Medico Inc.; Ono Pharmaceutical Co.; Bio Process Research and Development Laboratories; Analytical Research Laboratories; Ajinomoto Co.; Formulation Research; Analytical Research & Development Laboratories; Product Operations; CMC Laboratories; R&D Department; Pharmaceutical Technology Division,h-shibata@nihs.go.jp.

40180257,Lupus nephritis trials network (LNTN) repeat kidney biopsy-based definitions of treatment response: A systematic literature review-based proposal.,,Autoimmunity reviews,10.1016/j.autrev.2025.103810,"Within the frame of the Lupus Nephritis Trials Network (LNTN), we conducted a systematic literature review (SLR) to propose kidney tissue-based definitions of treatment outcomes in lupus nephritis (LN). Given the limitations of clinical markers like proteinuria in predicting immunological, histological, and long-term outcomes, our work emphasises the importance of repeat kidney biopsies. Such biopsies help identify discordance between clinical and histological response, which has implications for long-term kidney outcomes. The research objectives of this SLR focused on defining repeat biopsy-based treatment response and histological remission, and their associations with long-term outcomes. The SLR reviewed studies published from 2000 to 2022, identifying 20 eligible works. Histological response was commonly defined by changes in the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Activity Index (AI), with response indicated by a decrease of ≥50 % and to ≤3. Remission was most commonly defined as an AI score of 0. These benchmarks were associated with improved long-term renal outcomes, such as reduced flare rates and preserved kidney function. Conversely, NIH AI scores ≥4 and NIH Chronicity Index (CI) scores ≥4 were associated with poor prognosis, highlighting their predictive utility. Consensus definitions were established through expert panel deliberation, setting a foundation for standardising LN treatment evaluation in clinical trials and observational studies. These definitions are not intended for routine clinical decisions but aim to enhance uniformity and comparability in research, especially when repeat kidney biopsies are performed, an approach strongly advocated by our work. Further validation through ongoing initiatives and molecular characterisation efforts will refine these criteria, fostering advances in LN management and patient outcomes.",Costedoat-Chalumeau N; Malvar A; Houssiau FA,Nephrology Research Unit; Pôle de Pathologies Rhumatismales Inflammatoires et Systémiques; Service de médecine interne,ioannis.parodis@ki.se.

Here we examine the impact of PAD in patients receiving complex PCI (CPCI) and noncomplex PCI. Patients undergoing PCI at the Mount Sinai Hospital between 2012 and 2022 were stratified by the presence of CPCI and PAD. The primary outcome was major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), a composite of death, myocardial infarction, target vessel revascularization, or stroke within 1 year; secondary endpoints included bleeding events. An adjusted Cox proportional hazard method was used to evaluate risks of each outcome within each subgroup. Among 20,376 patients, 8,200 (40.2%) had CPCI and 1,959 (9.6%) had PAD. PAD patients were older and more likely to be female and have risk factors such as diabetes and smoking and were more commonly discharged with anticoagulants. 1-year risk of MACE was significantly higher for patients with PAD in both CPCI (19.6% vs 14.4%, adj. hazard ratio [HR] 1.31, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.08 to 1.58, p = 0.006) and no-CPCI strata (13.9% vs 9.2%, adj. HR 1.35, 95% CI 1.12 to 1.64, p = 0.002; p-interaction = 0.349). Bleeding events were also more frequent in PAD patients for CPCI (8.5% vs 5.5%, adj.

Solbinsiran, a GalNAc-conjugated small interfering RNA targeting hepatic angiopoietin-like protein 3 (ANGPTL3), reduced triglycerides and LDL-C concentrations in a phase 1 study. This study aimed to assess the durability and efficacy of solbinsiran in reducing concentrations of atherogenic lipoproteins in adults with mixed dyslipidaemia. This double-blind, parallel-arm, randomised, placebo-controlled, phase 2 trial enrolled adults (aged ≥18 years) with mixed dyslipidaemia at 41 clinical research units across seven countries. Patients receiving moderate-intensity or high-intensity statins, and with concentrations of fasting triglycerides between 1·69 mmol/L and 5·64 mmol/L, LDL-C of at least 1·81 mmol/L, and non-HDL cholesterol of at least 3·36 mmol/L were included.

However, regulatory decisions vary globally, with some drugs withdrawn in the US remaining approved in Japan. We conducted a cross-sectional analysis of Japanese professional society guidelines, evaluating recommendations for seven accelerated approval cancer drugs withdrawn from the US market but retained in Japan. We assessed for level of evidence and level of treatment preference ratings with consensus across guidelines issued by the corresponding Japanese professional societies. Four of the seven drugs (57%) were recommended as highly or moderately preferred treatment options in Japanese guidelines: gemtuzumab ozogamicin for acute myeloid leukemia, gefitinib for EGFR-positive non-small cell lung cancer, bevacizumab for HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer, and atezolizumab with nab-paclitaxel for PD-L1-positive triple-negative breast cancer. Detailed analysis of regulatory history and background of guideline recommendation revealed discrepancies in the assessment of clinical benefits: gemtuzumab ozogamicin failed to demonstrate benefits amid safety concerns, while gefitinib, bevacizumab, and atezolizumab were more controversial, although they did not demonstrate improved overall survival in post-marketing trials. Despite regulatory withdrawal in the US due to unproven clinical benefits, drugs retained in Japan received positive guideline recommendations. This finding highlights regional variations in regulatory decisions and different approaches to benefit-risk assessments, suggesting a need for improved transparency in Japan's regulatory decisions and guideline recommendations, with clearer justifications for endorsing drugs that are considered to have unproven clinical benefits in the US.",,,hayase.hakariya@uni-tuebingen.de.

However, its availability to patients requires preauthorization by the payors and is dispensed only through selected specialty pharmacies. We established a multistakeholder and multistep resmetirom prescription process pivoting to a dedicated pharmacist. It incorporates liver biochemistry testing at 12 weeks and liver clinic follow-up at 6 months after starting resmetirom. Fifteen hepatology providers prescribed resmetirom to 113 patients from April 1, 2024, to November 8, 2024, with histologic eligibility in 70% and noninvasive criteria in 30%. Resmetirom treatment was approved for 110 patients (97%), including 8 patients receiving the pharmaceutical company's patient assistance and 6 patients receiving bridge support to cover the co-pay. Eighty-three patients initiated resmetirom at an average of 30 days after its prescription. Adverse events were reported by 41% of patients taking resmetirom, and they were predominantly related to gastrointestinal symptoms and pruritus and/or rash with no evidence of hypersensitivity. Thirteen patients (16%) discontinued resmetirom after an average of 25.5 days (range: 2-68 d), with 11 patients discontinuing due to adverse events. The adverse events leading to discontinuation were nausea, diarrhea, and vomiting (n=4), right upper quadrant discomfort (n=2), left lower quadrant pain (n=1), rash with pruritus (n=1), pruritus and rash with indirect hyperbilirubinemia (n=1), dizziness (n=1), and mental fogginess (n=1). Follow-up liver biochemistries available in 24 patients showed no evidence of DILI. Our prescription pathway effectively dispensed resmetirom to nearly all patients who were prescribed resmetirom. One in 6 patients discontinued resmetirom, primarily due to side effects. This high discontinuation rate may be mitigated by modifying our follow-up from ""prescribe and forget"" to ""prescribe and closely follow.""",,,

Anti-inflammatory and vasoconstrictive treatments are ineffective in the rapid amelioration of the dryness, burning, and itching caused by skin barrier damage in patients with papulopustular rosacea. To assess the efficacy and safety of the topical application of compound heparin sodium allantoin gel to treat rosacea. Eighty-two patients participated in this randomized, prospective, single-center, and controlled trial. The Clinician Erythema Assessment score, Investigator Global Assessment score, transepidermal water loss, and skin hydration were evaluated at 0, 2, 4, 8, and 12 weeks. Rosacea-specific quality of life score, itching, dryness, burning, Global Aesthetic Improvement Scale, and Patient Self-Assessment grades were also assessed. Compared with the traditional therapy group, the 8-week and 12-week topical application of compound heparin sodium allantoin gel to treat rosacea significantly decreased Clinician Erythema Assessment/Investigator Global Assessment grades, burning and itching grades, and rosacea-specific quality of life scores. Compound heparin sodium allantoin gel significantly improved the skin barrier with hydration and significantly decreased trans-epidermal water loss. For patients with Demodex infestation, externally applied compound heparin sodium allantoin gel was associated with better rosacea treatment outcomes and improved skin barrier function than externally applied hyaluronic acid. This may be attributable to the inhibition of abnormal demodex, improved skin barrier, and repair of minor skin wounds. Compound heparin sodium allantoin gel effectively improved facial erythema, alleviated ithching and burning sensations, and improved patients' quality of life.

40177656,Developing personas to examine older adult engagement with televised direct-to-consumer advertisements: A theory based approach.,,Exploratory research in clinical and social pharmacy,10.1016/j.rcsop.2025.100589,"The average adult in the United States views up to 16 h of direct-to-consumer television advertisements (DTCA) per year, far exceeding time they spend with their primary care team. DTCAs present a unique opportunity to extend medical education beyond traditional medical settings and into the daily lives of patients. This is particularly valuable for populations with changing healthcare needs, such as older adults. As pharmaceutical companies invest in DTCAs, there is a growing need to identify what characteristics make viewers more likely to retain and act on medication information presented in DTCAs. This paper presents a theory based approach to developing personas of older adult DTCA viewers that categorize characteristics influencing their approach to healthcare engagement. In 2023, 25 older adult participants watched a one minute DTCA followed by a semi-structured interview. The interview guide applied concepts from the human factors engineering Communication-Human Information Processing model (C-HIP). C-HIP provided structure for both identifying personal characteristics that influence cognition and examining how these factors influence older adult's ability and desire to retain information from DTCAs. Personas were iteratively developed using qualitative analysis. The study yielded three main older adult DTCA viewing personas. These include: 1) medication averse older adults who actively avoid taking medications, 2) information seeking older adults who independently research health information to participate in shared-decision making, and 3) medication adhering older adults who prefer their provider to control decisions. Constructing older adult personas provides insights into the heterogeneity among older adult approaches to engaging with health information. Each persona represents unique information priorities and personal characteristics of older adults when viewing advertisements, thus presenting a need for tailored patient-centered messaging in commercials.",,,

Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were identified in a systematic review by searching Embase (including congress abstracts from 2021 to 2023), MEDLINE® and CENTRAL on 10 October 2023. Treatment outcomes from non-Asian RCTs for people with T2D previously treated with basal insulin, who switched to iGlarLixi or IDegAsp, were compared using a network meta-analysis (NMA). Data analysis was performed using R, version 4.0.2. The NMA included four RCTs (N = 2535). The results of the NMA showed that iGlarLixi (n = 810) was associated with a significantly greater reduction in HbA1c versus IDegAsp (n = 454) (mean difference [MD]: -0.39 [95% credible interval, CrI: -0.58, -0.21] %-units). iGlarLixi was also associated with a significantly greater likelihood of achieving an HbA1c of <7.0% (risk ratio: 1.42, 95% CrI: 1.18, 1.71).

Radiofrequency renal denervation (RF RDN) effectively lowers BP throughout 24 h and thus may provide an effective antihypertensive therapeutic option. This analysis assesses the effects of RDN on nocturnal hypertension with different dipper patterns defined by nighttime/daytime BP ratio (i.e. dippers, non-dippers, risers) through 2 years in patients randomized to RDN from the SPYRAL HTN-OFF MED and -ON MED trials. Office and 24-h ambulatory BP, were also evaluated in patients stratified by age, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and chronic kidney disease (CKD). Among 388 patients, the baseline nighttime systolic BP (SBP) was 139.3 ± 11.3 mmHg. Patients with a riser pattern had the highest baseline nighttime SBP (152.7 ± 8.0 mmHg). At 2 years, patients experienced a significant reduction from baseline (p < 0.0001) in nighttime (-12.0 ± 17.1 mmHg), morning (-14.8 ± 20.0 mmHg), daytime (-13.8 ± 14.7 mmHg), and 24-h SBP (-13.4 ± 14.2 mmHg). The greatest reduction in SBP was in risers at nighttime (-23.7 ± 14.3 mmHg). RDN was equally effective in lowering nighttime BP in patients ≥65 years old or with OSA, CKD, or T2DM. In this pooled dataset of RF RDN patients, clinically meaningful reductions in BP over a 24-h period were observed through 2 years irrespective of dipping status. RF RDN may reduce the risk of cardiovascular outcomes in patients with uncontrolled hypertension, especially in those with elevated nighttime BP who may be the most challenging to treat.",Liu M,Medtronic Inc,kkario@jichi.ac.jp.

To our knowledge, this is the first observational study to assess violations of California's law. It reports on the availability of flavoured vape products in vape shops and tests whether flavoured vape products were more common in vape shops nearer to college campuses compared with those farther from college campuses, adjusting for neighbourhood demographics. Between April and July 2023, observations were recorded at vape shops (n=400) nearer to (≤3 miles) or farther from (>3 miles) a college campus. Vape shops were the focus of this study because a large proportion (48.2%) of US young adults purchase vapes from these venues. Availability of any disposable nicotine vapes, JUUL pods and flavoured varieties of these products were recorded. Multivariable logistic regressions tested relationships between flavoured product availability, proximity to a college campus and store neighbourhood demographics. In violation of California's law, flavoured disposable vapes and/or JUUL pods were available in 50.3% of all vape shops studied. Flavoured disposable vapes were in 53.2% of vape shops with any disposable vapes, and flavoured JUUL pods were in 30.9% of vape shops with any JUUL pods. Contrary to expectation, no significant relationships were identified between the availability of flavoured vapes and proximity to a college campus or store neighbourhood demographics.

Reported epidemiological data are conflicting. We aimed to evaluate nationwide and regional prevalences of lipodystrophy and insulin resistance syndrome in France, and to study diagnostic and care-pathways. We studied data from the French National Rare Disease Registry (BNDMR), which includes all patients attending rare disease reference centers in France. We analyzed demographic data and age at first signs and at diagnosis in patients with an ORPHA code of lipodystrophy or severe insulin resistance syndrome. The number of patients registered with lipodystrophy/insulin resistance syndrome doubled from 2017 to 2023, with the deployment of nationwide epidemiological tools in specialized rare diseases centers. Currently, 567 of the 652 patients (58% female) had a diagnosis of genetically determined disease with generalized (GL) or partial lipodystrophy (PL), giving an estimated national prevalence of 1.6 and 6.4 per million, respectively. Wide regional differences in estimated prevalence may be partly due to founder pathogenic variants, or local spread of clinical skills and knowledge. Median age at first signs and diagnosis were respectively 1 [IQR: 1-3] and 5 years [0-20] for GL, and 22 [14-35] and 40 years [25-52] for PL, with earlier first signs of PL in women than in men.

While transformations at the periphery of these rings are well-established, modifying their core frameworks has remained an underexplored frontier. Our group has pioneered the concept, termed ""aromatic metamorphosis"", enabling skeletal transformations of aromatic rings by replacing an endocyclic atom with a different atom or inserting an atom into aromatic rings, which leads to novel synthetic strategies and diverse molecular architectures.The concept of aromatic metamorphosis was first demonstrated in the stepwise conversion of dibenzothiophenes and dibenzofurans into triphenylenes. These transformations, facilitated by palladium and nickel catalysts, involve the strategic activation of robust C-S and C-O bonds as the key steps. Next, the approach was extended to the two-step conversions of dibenzothiophenes into carbazoles, dibenzophospholes, fluorenes, etc., which involve oxidation into the corresponding sulfones and subsequent sequential inter- and intramolecular nucleophilic aromatic substitution reactions. These new synthetic routes have provided efficient access to optoelectronic materials. Especially, the S",,,

In particular, the strengths of POC viscoelastometry (VET) lie not only in the rapid availability of test results but also in the fact that VET provides insights into coagulation that cannot be detected by standard laboratory tests. The relevance of POC-VET in the optimal management of patients with acutely acquired bleeding disorders, such as trauma-induced coagulopathy, is now unquestioned and is also reflected in the corresponding guidelines; however, VET also provides important information about fibrinolysis and fibrinolytic activity and in combination with other laboratory values can possibly also be sensitive for prothrombotic coagulation disorders. Therefore, POC-VET is increasingly being used in intensive care medicine. The use of POC diagnostics is not subject to the same standards as central laboratory testing. In order to maintain high quality and avoid harming patients, the requirements for medical device manufacturers in particular have been increased as part of the in vitro diagnostic reagents (IVDR) regulations, which places high demands on quality management in particular. The variety of POC devices and the lack of comparability between them remains an unsolved problem. It should be critically discussed to what extent medical device manufacturers and pharmaceutical companies could be legally required to keep unique and urgently needed technologies on the market, especially if no comparable alternatives will be available in the foreseeable future. Overall, from today's perspective, the use of POC coagulation diagnostics is essential for optimal patient care. Die Point-of-care(POC)-Gerinnungsdiagnostik ist ein elementarer Bestandteil in der klinischen Versorgung von Patient*innen geworden. Die Stärken insbesondere der Point-of-care-Viskoelastometrie (POC-VET) liegen nicht nur in der schnellen Verfügbarkeit von Resultaten, sondern insbesondere auch darin, dass die VET Einblicke in die Gerinnung, welche mit Standardlaborverfahren nicht detektierbar sind, ermöglicht. Die Relevanz der POC-VET für die optimale Versorgung von Patient*innen mit akut erworbenen hämorrhagischen Gerinnungsstörungen, etwa im Rahmen der traumainduzierten Koagulopathie ist mittlerweile unumstritten und findet ihren Einzug auch in entsprechende Guidelines. Darüber hinaus kann die VET allerdings auch wichtige Hinweise liefern über die Fibrinolyse bzw. fibrinolytische Aktivität und in der Zusammenschau mit anderen Werten möglicherweise auch Ausschluss geben über prothrombotische Gerinnungsstörungen. Daher findet die POC-VET vermehrt Anwendung auch in der Intensivmedizin. Um der breiten Anwendung gerecht zu werden, wurden insbesondere die Anforderungen an die Medizinproduktehersteller im Rahmen der IVDR verschärft, was hohe Anforderungen an ein Qualitätsmanagement stellt. Weiterhin kritisch anzusehen, bleiben die Vielfalt an POC-Geräten und die fehlende Vergleichbarkeit untereinander. Daher muss diskutiert werden, inwieweit Medizinproduktehersteller und Pharmaunternehmen gesetzlich verpflichtet werden sollten – bzw. wie gesetzliche Reglungen durchzusetzen sind –, um einzigartige relevante Technologien auf dem Markt zu behalten.

Adolescent patients (aged 12 to <18 years) with HAE-C1INH enrolled in EMPOWER and ENABLE received open-label lanadelumab 300 mg once every 2 weeks. Effectiveness outcomes were based on patient-reported assessments of on-treatment HAE attacks. Safety was assessed through the recording of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) and serious adverse events. This analysis categorized patients as ""new"" or ""established"" lanadelumab patients. Thirteen new and seven established patients on lanadelumab were included. The observed monthly attack rate in new patients fell from 3.8 (mean) and 2.8 (median) during the pre-enrollment period to 0.65 (mean) and 0.21 (median) during the cumulative study period after lanadelumab initiation (84.2% and 92.9% reductions, respectively). In established patients, mean (SD) HAE attack rate (as treated) during the overall study period was 0.04 (0.03) attacks/month. Most HAE attacks were of mild/moderate severity. Nine new patients reported 42 TEAEs, mostly mild/moderate in severity, with 3 TEAEs reported as serious. Seven established patients reported 12 TEAEs (all mild/moderate and non-serious). No TEAEs were related to lanadelumab.

40171210,High-sensitivity C-reactive Protein in Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease: To Measure or Not to Measure?,,US cardiology,10.15420/usc.2024.25,"Inflammation and dyslipidemia are central to the pathogenesis of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). While lipid-lowering therapies are the cornerstone of ASCVD prevention and treatment, there are other emerging targets, including inflammation (which has been dubbed the 'residual inflammatory risk'), that can be addressed after LDL cholesterol thresholds have been reached. Research over the past 20 years has identified C-reactive protein (CRP) as a key marker of inflammation with atherosclerosis. The association of more sensitive measures of CRP (high- sensitivity C-reactive protein [hsCRP]) with ASCVD risk in epidemiological studies has also led to its incorporation as a risk enhancer in primary prevention guidelines and its incorporation into risk stratification tools. While there are no formal recommendations related to measurement of hsCRP in secondary prevention, consideration should be given to an individualized approach that addresses inflammatory risk in those with major adverse cardiovascular events, despite maximal lipid-lowering therapy and well-controlled LDL cholesterol levels. The aim of this review is to discuss the role of inflammation in ASCVD, the use of hsCRP as a tool to assess residual inflammatory risk to target upstream pathways such as glucose intolerance and obesity, and to consider use of additional anti-inflammatory medications for ASCVD risk reduction. The authors provide clinical context around when to measure hsCRP in clinical practice and how to address residual inflammatory risk in ASCVD.",,,

A systematic literature review (SLR) was conducted in MEDLINE and Embase to identify publications up to May 2023, including patients with SCD or TDT treated with allo-HSCT. Occurrence of vaso-occlusive crises (VOCs) including acute pain, acute chest syndrome, priapism, and splenic sequestration in SCD, and red blood cell transfusion (RBCT) requirements in TDT were the main outcomes of interest. Transplant-related outcomes such as graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and graft failure/rejection were summarized in the studies that reported main outcomes. Proportion of patients experiencing VOCs or RBCTs, GVHD, and graft failure/rejection after allo-HSCT were aggregated and descriptively reported with range across studies. Thirty-one SCD studies met inclusion criteria. Twenty-nine studies assessed for VOC and pain crisis events after allo-HSCT; 11 studies reported ≥1 VOCs after allo-HSCT in 6.9% of the 2,760 patients. Graft failure was reported in 14.4% (0.9%-18.8%, 14 studies) of patients, graft rejection in 5.5% (1.6%-100.0%, 12 studies) of patients, acute GVHD in 22.4% (1.6%-50.0%, 19 studies) of patients, and chronic GVHD in 20.4% (3.3%-57.1%, 14 studies) of patients. Seventy-eight TDT studies met inclusion criteria. Fifty-six studies reported that 8.8% of the 3,107 patients required RBCTs after allo-HSCT. Graft failure was reported in 5.4% (1.1%-80.0%, 21 studies) of patients, graft rejection in 7.5% (0.5%-42.9%, 50 studies) of patients, acute GVHD in 28.4% (5.2%-100.0%, 57 studies) and chronic GVHD in 15.2% (1.3%-50.0%, 51 studies) of TDT patients. Based on this SLR, after allo-HSCT, a portion of patients with SCD continue to experience VOCs and a portion of patients with TDT continue to require RBCTs, in addition to experiencing GVHD and graft failure or rejection.",Nair R; Li N; Imren S; Kohli P; Lach K; Zhu L; Dudzic M,Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated; Maple Health Group LLC,

Americas,10.1016/j.lana.2025.101021,"Nunavut is a northern Canadian territory where a high proportion of infants are admitted to hospital with acute respiratory tract infection (ARI). Previous studies have been limited in regional and/or short duration of coverage. This study aimed to estimate the incidence rate, microbiology and outcomes of ARI hospitalizations in Nunavut infants. We conducted a retrospective cohort study of infants aged <1 year from Nunavut hospitalized for ARI at two regional and four tertiary pediatric hospitals in Canada, January 1, 2010, to June 30, 2020. One regional hospital was located in Nunavut; others were located across Canada. Descriptive statistics and multivariable logistic regression were performed. We identified 1189 ARI admissions, with an incidence rate of 133.9 per 1000 infants per year (95% confidence interval (CI): 126.8, 141.3). Of these admissions, 56.0% (n = 666) were to regional hospitals alone, 72.3% (n = 860) involved hospitalization outside of Nunavut, 15.6% (n = 185) were admitted into intensive care, and 9.2% (n = 109) underwent mechanical ventilation. Among 730 admissions with a pathogen identified, 45.8% had respiratory syncytial virus (RSV; n = 334), for a yearly incidence rate of 37.8 RSV-associated hospitalizations per 1000 infants (95% CI: 33.9, 42.1). Among RSV-associated hospitalizations, 41.1% (n = 138) were infants 0-2 months of age and 32.1% (n = 108) were >6 months. Compared with non-RSV admissions, infants with RSV had higher odds of admission into intensive care, oxygen therapy, CPAP/BiPAP respiratory support and length of hospital stay over a week. Understanding the high burden of ARI among Nunavut infants can inform health policy and serve as a baseline for assessing the impact of any new interventions targeting infant ARIs.

Although the precise mechanisms underlying aging-related GI dysmotility are not fully understood, neuronal loss or degeneration in the enteric nervous system (ENS) may be involved. Aged garlic extract (AGE) has been shown to have several beneficial effects in the GI tract; however, it is not known whether AGE can improve GI motility in older animals. The aim of the present study was to examine the effects of AGE on the ENS and gut motility in older mice and elucidate potential mechanisms of action. An AGE-formulated diet was given to 18-month-old female mice for 2 weeks. Organ bath studies and cell culture demonstrated that AGE: i) Altered gut contractile activity; ii) enhanced viability of ENS cells; and iii) exhibited neuroprotective effects on the ENS via reduction in oxidative stress. These findings suggest that AGE could be used to develop novel dietary therapeutics for aging-related GI dysmotility by targeting the associated loss and damage of the ENS.",,,

MCED tests can detect cancer signals from multiple cancers concurrently in biological samples such as blood, urine, saliva, or other bodily fluids. Some tests can suggest the most likely cancer origin, whereas others report cancer detected somewhere in the body. Although some MCED tests are currently commercially available, none are approved by the Food and Drug Administration or endorsed by any clinical practice guideline or recommendation. Most insurance companies do not currently cover MCED testing. MCED tests have not yet been evaluated for safety and effectiveness in randomized controlled trials. Because patients already are asking for MCED test prescriptions or for interpretation of results from tests acquired elsewhere, clinicians should be prepared to discuss what is known about the benefits, risks, and uncertainties of MCED testing, including performance characteristics in screening populations and preferred follow-up strategies for positive test results. At this time, clinicians should not feel obligated to initiate discussions about MCED testing with their patients. However, clinicians should engage patients who inquire about getting tested or previous MCED test results in shared decision-making, and take the opportunity to offer and help patients complete age- and sex-appropriate guideline-recommended cancer screenings. In this article, the current evidence and issues around MCED testing are summarized, and a framework for shared decision-making discussions is provided.",,,

Electronic QMSs (eQMSs) are gaining recognition for their ability to centralize and automate key quality processes, significantly enhancing operational efficiency and regulatory readiness. Through an in-depth case study of the University of Southern California and Children's Hospital of Los Angeles academic cGMP facility, this review demonstrates tangible improvements achieved by adopting an eQMS. Practical insights gained from this experience are shared, including careful selection of eQMS platforms, phased rollout strategies, and comprehensive staff training. The review also addresses common implementation challenges and suggests practical solutions to overcome them. Lessons learned and strategies discussed here can serve as valuable guidance for other academic institutions considering eQMS adoption.

Here we present InflaMix (INFLAmmation MIXture Model), an unsupervised quantitative model integrating 14 pre-CAR-T infusion laboratory and cytokine measures capturing inflammation and end-organ function. Developed using a cohort of 149 patients with NHL, InflaMix revealed an inflammatory signature associated with a high risk of CAR-T treatment failure, including increased hazard of death or relapse (hazard ratio, 2.98; 95% confidence interval, 1.60-4.91; P < 0.001). Three independent cohorts comprising 688 patients with NHL from diverse treatment centers were used to validate our approach. InflaMix consistently and reproducibly identified patients with a higher likelihood of disease relapse and mortality, and it provided supplementary predictive value beyond established prognostic markers, including tumor burden. Moreover, InflaMix exhibited robust performance in cases with missing data, maintaining accuracy when considering only six readily available laboratory measures. These findings show that InflaMix is a valuable tool for point-of-care clinical decision-making in patients with NHL undergoing CAR-T therapy.",,,shouvalr@mskcc.org.

This study examined the association between demographic and clinical variables and patient progression to a more severe MG Foundation of America (MGFA) classification. Data were drawn from the Adelphi Real World myasthenia gravis Disease Specific Programme™, a cross-sectional survey capturing retrospective data from patients' medical histories. Among 421 individuals, 16% experienced increased gMG severity (progression to higher MGFA class between diagnosis and the time of the survey, 1-7 years later) and for 84%, gMG was stable/improved (MGFA class the same/lower). Logistic elastic net regression determined that increased severity was associated with the occurrence of prior misdiagnosis. Bivariate analyses indicated significant associations between increased severity and longer time between symptom onset and (a) the first consultation with a healthcare practitioner and (b) MG diagnosis. Increased severity was also associated with older age and presence of specific symptoms at diagnosis. gMG stability/improvement was associated with employment status and general fatigue at diagnosis. There is a need for prompt and accurate diagnosis and improved treatment options with the potential to increase the likelihood of stability/improvement for gMG patients.",Pesa J; Choudhry Z; de Courcy J; Barlow S; Birija SL; Chatterton E; Gibson G; Hahn B; Govindarajan R,; HSHS Medical Group Multispecialty Care - St. Elizabeth's; Adelphi Real World; Janssen Scientific Affairs,JPesa@its.jnj.com.
40169520,Alternative Payment Models for Innovative Medicines: A Framework for Effective Implementation.,,Applied health economics and health policy,10.1007/s40258-025-00960-1,"Scientific advancements offer significant opportunities for better patient outcomes, but also present new challenges for value assessment, affordability and access. Alternative payment models (APMs) can offer solutions to the ensuing payer challenges. However, a comprehensive framework that matches the spectrum of challenges with the right solution, and places them within a framework for implementation, is currently missing. To fill this gap, we propose evidence-based steps for the effective selection and implementation of APMs. First, contracting challenges should be identified and mapped to potential APM solutions. We developed a decision guide that can serve as a starting point to articulate core problems and map these to APM solutions. The main problem categories identified are: budget impact and uncertainty, value uncertainty, and the scope of value assessment and negotiation. Sub-categories include affordability, uncertainty of effectiveness, and patient heterogeneity, which map onto APM solutions such as outcome-based agreements, instalments, and subscription models. Just as important are the subsequent identification and assessment of the feasibility of potential solutions as well as collaboration to reach agreement on the terms of the APM and lay the groundwork for effective implementation. We adduce recent examples of APM implementation as evidence of how commonly cited implementation barriers can be overcome by applying pragmatic design choices and collaboration. This step-by-step framework can aid payers and manufacturers in the process of effectively identifying, agreeing on, and implementing APMs to advance patient access to cost-effective medicines, while at the same time providing appropriate incentives to support future innovation.",McElwee F; Cole A; Kaliappan G; Masters A; Steuten L,F.

This study investigates the impact of environmental factors on aqueous aerosol behaviour using a Respimat® Soft Mist Inhaler (SMI) formulated with and without ethanol content. Comparative Hygroscopic Aerosol Particle Sizing (CHAPS) was used to measure aerosol size distribution under varying RH levels, while single droplet analysis was conducted using Comparative Kinetics-Electrodynamic Balance (CK-EDB) to assess particle behaviour. The findings reveal that increased RH results in larger particle sizes, while elevated ethanol content consistently decreases both particle size and mass. The strong agreement between CHAPS measurements and CK-EDB data suggests that aerosol plume behaviour can be accurately modelled from single droplet data. The study highlights ethanol's role in optimizing particle size distribution, which is crucial for enhancing the therapeutic efficiency of inhaled medications. These results underscore the importance of tailoring formulation and environmental conditions to improve drug delivery outcomes in pulmonary therapies and the importance of recognising that aerosol particle size distributions are dynamic and highly compositionally dependent.",Ruiz JR; Friend R,Chiesi Ltd.,j.p.reid@bristol.ac.uk.

We evaluated the immunogenicity and safety of a quadrivalent meningococcal tetanus toxoid-conjugate vaccine (MenACYW-TT) booster in children primed with the same meningococcal vaccine 5 years earlier. Immune persistence following priming vaccination was also evaluated, and the study is ongoing to generate 10 years' post-priming data. Healthy children, vaccinated with MenACYW-TT 5 years earlier as toddlers, were enrolled. Participants were randomized to receive MenACYW-TT booster (group 1) or no booster (group 2), stratified by country and meningococcal serogroup C (MenC) vaccination status (primed at age ≤ 1 year vs. naive). Antibodies against each serogroup were measured by serum bactericidal assay using human complement (hSBA). Seroresponse sufficiency at 30 days post-booster was demonstrated if the lower limit of the one-sided 97.5% confidence interval (CI) of the seroresponse rate (proportion of participants with post-vaccination titers ≥ 1:16 when baseline titers were < 1:8 or with a ≥ fourfold increase when baseline titers were ≥ 1:8) was > 75% for each serogroup. Seroprotection rates (proportion with hSBA titers ≥ 1:8) and geometric mean titers (GMTs) for each serogroup were also assessed. A total of 209 participants were enrolled across 26 sites in Finland, Germany, Hungary, and Spain (group 1, n = 93; group 2, n = 116). Five years post-priming, GMTs, and seroprotection rates were higher than those observed before priming vaccination in both groups, indicating long-term persistence. Booster seroresponse rates in group 1 for all serogroups ranged from 93.2% to 98.9%, with seroresponse sufficiency demonstrated (lower limit of one-sided 97.5% CIs for the seroresponse rates ranging from 85.7% to 93.8%). Seroprotection rates and GMTs post-booster increased across all serogroups, with nearly all participants seroprotected, suggesting adequate booster response. Seroresponse was comparable between MenC-primed and MenC-naive participants. No new safety concerns were identified. MenACYW-TT provides long-term immune persistence and a robust immune response when administered as a booster in children primed 5 years earlier.

These insights have guided millimeter-precise selection of brain stimulation targets based on RSNs. Concurrently, Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) studies revealed that baseline brain states, measured by EEG signal power or phase, affect stimulation outcomes. However, EEG dynamics in these studies are mostly limited to single regions or channels, lacking the spatial resolution needed for accurate network-level characterization. We aim at mapping brain networks with high spatial and temporal precision and to assess whether the occurrence of specific network-level-states impact TMS outcome. To this end, we will identify large-scale brain networks and explore how their dynamics relates to corticospinal excitability. This study leverages Hidden Markov Models to identify large-scale brain states from pre-stimulus source space high-density-EEG data collected during TMS targeting the left primary motor cortex in twenty healthy subjects. The association between states and fMRI-defined RSNs was explored using the Yeo atlas, and the trial-by-trial relation between states and corticospinal excitability was examined. We extracted fast-dynamic large-scale brain states with unique spatiotemporal and spectral features resembling major RSNs. The engagement of different networks significantly influences corticospinal excitability, with larger motor evoked potentials when baseline activity was dominated by the sensorimotor network. These findings represent a step forward towards characterizing brain network in EEG-TMS with both high spatial and temporal resolution and underscore the importance of incorporating large-scale network dynamics into TMS experiments.",,,laura.marzetti@unich.it.

It is known to be an obligate diploid organism with an incomplete and atypical sexual cycle. Azole-resistant C. tropicalis isolates have been observed with increasing prevalence in many countries in recent years. Here, we report that tebuconazole (TBZ), a triazole fungicide widely used in agriculture, can induce ploidy plasticity and the formation of haploid cells in C. tropicalis. The evolved C. tropicalis strains with ploidy variations exhibit a cross-resistance between TBZ and standard azoles used in clinical settings (such as fluconazole and voriconazole). Similar to its diploid cells, these newly discovered C. tropicalis haploid cells are capable of undergoing filamentation, white-opaque switching, and mating. However, compared to its diploid cells, these haploid C. tropicalis cells grow more slowly under in vitro culture conditions and are less virulent in a mouse model of systemic infection. Interestingly, flow cytometry analysis of a clinical strain with extremely low genome heterozygosity indicates the existence of natural C. tropicalis haploids. Discovery of this C. tropicalis haploid state sheds new light into the biology and genetic plasticity of C. tropicalis and could provide the framework for the development of new genetic tools in the field.",,,

However, characterizing these complex and unstable products remains challenging. Developing fast, reliable methods to assess critical quality attributes (CQAs) of the mRNA component is crucial for ensuring the safety and efficacy of these medicines. Currently, evaluating key CQAs, such as mRNA integrity and encapsulation efficiency, often involves a labor-intensive manual extraction protocol, which requires LNP disruption prior to analysis. However, these additional offline steps contribute to mRNA degradation and measurement uncertainties, highlighting the urgent need for rapid and effective methods capable of performing an online LNP disruption. Hydrophilic interaction chromatography (HILIC) might offer a promising solution to address this need. Due to the presence of high concentrations of organic solvent and the possibility to work at elevated temperatures, HILIC might enable on-column disruption of LNPs while preserving the full integrity of the mRNA payload, facilitating a streamlined characterization process. To evaluate this, we developed two proof of concept HILIC methods. The first one disrupts LNPs and retains the mRNA payload using a high percentage of organic solvent and elevated temperatures. The second one, relying on milder conditions, retains only the unencapsulated mRNA, which can be used to evaluate the encapsulation efficiency. Both methods were used on Comirnaty and Spikevax vaccines and on Sanofi's in-development mRNA product as model samples. Our preliminary findings suggest that HILIC holds potential for online LNP disruption, mRNA integrity assessment, and encapsulation efficiency analysis. They also highlight the limitations of small-pore-sized columns currently available on the market.",Lauber MA; Fekete S; Imiołek M,Waters Corporation,

We explore the complexity and importance of the intestinal barrier function and how disruptions of the intestinal barrier and dysbiosis work in concert to promote the onset and progression of MASLD. The Review focuses on specific bacterial, viral, and fungal communities that impact the trajectory of MASLD and how specific metabolites (including ethanol, bile acids, short chain fatty acids, and other metabolites) contribute to disease pathogenesis. Finally, we underscore how knowledge of the interaction between gut microbes and the intestinal barrier may be leveraged for MASLD microbial-based therapeutics.

This was an extension of the SPIKE trial that examined if early sitagliptin initiation improved long-term cardiovascular outcomes. In the SPIKE trial, 282 participants were randomized to either sitagliptin or conventional treatment to examine the effects of sitagliptin on carotid atherosclerosis. All participants who completed the SPIKE trial were recruited to this prospective, observational, cohort study and followed for up to 520 weeks. The primary endpoint was the first occurrence of a major cardiovascular event, which included acute myocardial infarction, stroke, or total mortality. Events of composite primary outcome occurred in only a few participants in each group (15 [12.6%] in the sitagliptin group and eight in the conventional treatment group [6.7%]). The incidence rate of the primary outcome did not differ significantly between two groups. In post hoc Poisson regression analysis, there were no significant between-group differences in the incidence rates of composite recurrence events for the same outcomes as the primary endpoint. Early initiation of sitagliptin as add-on therapy to insulin was not linked to reduced risk of composite cardiovascular disease. This may be due to low event numbers in both groups and/or relatively lower continuation rates of DPP-4 inhibitors in the sitagliptin group during the follow-up period.

Using an ESC-to-neural progenitor cell (NPC) differentiation model, we show that CTCF-ZF1 is crucial for maintaining cell-type-specific chromatin loops. Expression of CTCF-ΔZF1 leads to disrupted loops and dysregulation of genes within these loops, particularly those involved in neuronal development and function.

This study analyzed the characteristics, frequencies, and reasons for applications for medicines proposed for inclusion in the WHO EML not being recommended. Assessment of the recommendations for all medicines proposed for inclusion in the WHO EML in reports of the Expert Committee on Selection and Use of Essential Medicines in the WHO Technical Reports Series from 2002 to 2023. We collected key information from EML applications including active substance, therapeutic indication, orphan status, applicant, and reasons for negative recommendations. Logistic univariate and multivariate regression analyses assessed predictive characteristics for applications with negative recommendations. A total of 359 applications for addition of new medicines to the EML were submitted: 211 (58.8%) received a positive recommendation. Among the 148 (41.2%) applications with a negative recommendation, the most prevalent reasons for not recommending were quality of clinical evidence (62.1%) and economic criteria (33.1%). Concerns about capacity to implement the new medicines in health care systems or requiring specialized expertise increased over time. Applications submitted by pharmaceutical companies, individuals not affiliated with scientific societies or non-governmental organizations, and academia were more prone to receiving a negative recommendation. An appreciable proportion of applications for addition of new medicines to the EML are not recommended. Over time, low or limited quality of clinical evidence was a consistent explanatory reason leading to non-recommending.

Proteomic studies have been instrumental in identifying AD-related proteins present in the brain, cerebrospinal fluid, and plasma. This study comprehensively examined 6,905 plasma proteins in more than 3,300 well-characterized individuals to identify new proteins, pathways, and predictive model for AD. With three-stage analysis (discovery, replication, and meta-analysis) we identified 416 proteins (294 novel) associated with clinical AD status and the findings were further validated in two external datasets including more than 7,000 samples and seven previous studies. Pathway analysis revealed that these proteins were involved in endothelial and blood hemostatic (ACHE, SMOC1, SMOC2, VEGFA, VEGFB, SPARC), capturing blood brain barrier (BBB) disruption due to disease. Other pathways were capturing known processes implicated in AD, such as lipid dysregulation (APOE, BIN1, CLU, SMPD1, PLA2G12A, CTSF) or immune response (C5, CFB, DEFA5, FBXL4), which includes proteins known to be part of the causal pathway indicating that some of the identified proteins and pathways are involved in disease pathogenesis. An enrichment of brain and neural pathways (axonal guidance signaling or myelination signaling) indicates that, in fact, blood proteomics capture brain- and disease-related changes, which can lead to the identification of novel biomarkers and predictive models. Machine learning model was employed to identify a set of seven proteins that were highly predictive of both clinical AD (AUC > 0.72) and biomarker-defined AD status (AUC > 0.88), that were replicated in multiple external cohorts as well as with orthogonal platforms. These extensive findings underscore the potential of using plasma proteins as biomarkers for early detection and monitoring of AD, as well as potentially guiding treatment decisions.",Gonzalez-Escalante A; Boada M,Barcelona Beta.; Universitat Internacional de Catalunya.,

Yet, the mechanistic basis of such comorbidities and the transmission of neural hypersensitivity across organ systems has remained a mystery. Here, we identify a mast cell-sensory neuron circuit that initiates bladder inflammation and simultaneously propagates neural hypersensitivity to the colon in a murine model of IC/BPS. We unveil anatomic heterogeneity of mast cells in relation to nociceptors in the bladder and their critical dependence on Mas-related G protein-coupled receptor B2 (MrgprB2) to promote visceral hypersensitivity. Employing retrograde neuronal tracing, in vivo calcium imaging, and intersectional genetics, we uncover a population of polyorganic sensory neurons that simultaneously innervate multiple organs and exhibit functional convergence. Importantly, using humanized mice, we demonstrate that pharmacological blockade of mast cell-expressed MRGPRX2, the human ortholog of MrgprB2, attenuates both bladder pathology and colonic hypersensitivity.

A drug data set was compiled using data from the Ministry of Health and Welfare (MoHW) and public institutions. Additional information on pharmaceutical companies and indications was obtained from the Korea Food and Drug Administration (KFDA). Descriptive statistics were used to summarise variable distributions. Chi-squared tests and multivariate logistic regression analyses, including interaction terms, were performed to determine differences before and after the implementation of the waiver system and their relevance to negotiation outcomes. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS version 27.0 with a significance level of 0.05. From 2007 to 2022, a total of 785 new drugs have been introduced. In Korea, the waiver system includes two types: a price negotiation waiver primarily for non-orphan and non-cancer drugs and an economic evaluation waiver designed for orphan and cancer drugs with significant clinical needs. Drugs listed in three or fewer countries were significantly more likely to utilise the price negotiation waiver system due to pricing disadvantages associated with limited international registration. Since the introduction of the two waiver systems, there has been a notable increase in negotiation agreement rates for orphan and cancer drugs, a trend supported by regression analysis. This study demonstrates how Korea's two-waiver system streamlined the reimbursement process, improving access to orphan and cancer drugs while ensuring financial sustainability. The system's eligibility criteria effectively balance the needs of noncritical and critical diseases, ensuring equitable access while maintaining fiscal responsibility. These findings have important institutional implications for improving patient access to medicines while effectively managing financial expenditure.",,,

The stability of vitamins directly affects the shelf life and market competitiveness of products in the nutrient-fortified foods/drugs sector. Encapsulation via emulsion spray drying is a commonly utilized method to enhance the stability of active substances. It boasts a wide range of applications and capability for automated and continuous production. The wall material of microcapsules represents one of the pivotal factors influencing their properties, potentially mitigating the degradation of active substances during storage. This study aimed to investigate the characteristics of vitamin A acetate (VAA) high-loading-capacity emulsions and microcapsules formulated with different encapsulating agents (gum arabic (GA), gelatin (GEL), white sugar (WS) and octenyl succinic acid-modified starch) prepared by spray drying. According to the accelerated storage experiment formula, the shelf life of microcapsules stored at 60 °C for 35 days is about 1 year, and the retention rate of GA + GEL/WS microcapsules with a loading capacity of 100 g kg The results showed that spray drying of microcapsules improved the water solubility and storage stability of VAA. At high loading levels, the synergistic effect between wall materials can improve the density of microcapsules, thereby enhancing the storage stability of VAA microcapsules. Such higher storage stability is beneficial for extending the shelf life of fortified foods and pharmaceuticals, thereby expanding the application of VAA in the food sector. © 2025 Society of Chemical Industry.",,,

Early detection is crucial, yet traditional methods struggle with AF's transient nature. This study investigates how augmenting ECG data with heart rate variability (HRV) and demographic data (age and sex) can improve AF detection. We analysed 35 634 12-lead ECG recordings from three public databases (China Physiological Signal Challenge-Extra, PTB-XL and Georgia), each with physician-validated AF labels. A range of convolutional neural network models, including AlexNet, VGG-16, ResNet and transformers, were tested for AF prediction, enriched with HRV and demographic data to explore the effectiveness of the multimodal approach. Each data modality (ECG, HRV and demographic) was assessed for its contribution to model performance using fivefold cross-validation. Performance improvements were evaluated across key metrics, and saliency maps were generated to provide further insights into model behaviour and identify critical features in AF detection. Integrating HRV and demographic data with ECG substantially improved performance. AlexNet and VGG-16 outperformed more complex models, achieving AUROC of 0.9617 (95% CI 0.95 to 0.97) and 0.9668 (95% CI 0.96 to 0.97), respectively. Adding HRV data showed the most significant improvement in sensitivity, with AlexNet increasing from 0.9117 to 0.9225 and VGG-16 from 0.9216 to 0.9225. Combining both HRV and demographic data led to further improvements, with AlexNet achieving a sensitivity of 0.9225 (up from 0.9192 with HRV) and VGG-16 reaching 0.9113 (up from 0.9097 with HRV). The combination of HRV and demographic data resulted in the highest gains in sensitivity and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. Saliency maps confirmed the models identified key AF features, such as the absence of the P-wave, validating the multimodal approach. AlexNet and VGG-16 excelled in AF detection, with HRV data improving sensitivity, and demographic data providing additional benefits.

Yet, their clinical application is generally restricted to injectable therapies. The main challenge hindering their broader use through globally accessible, patient-friendly, and non-invasive delivery routes such as oral or buccal, lies in their poor ability to cross biological barriers effectively. Here, we demonstrate that enzymes can be harnessed to transiently reduce these barriers and improve absorption. As a proof of concept, we employ a mucin-specific protease (mucinase) and a phospholipase to increase mucus diffusivity and epithelial cell membrane permeability, respectively. In a canine model, we show that enteric capsules containing both enzymes, and the peptide drug desmopressin achieved a relative bioavailability of 155 % compared to the drug alone. Additionally, a buccal patch loaded with phospholipase and semaglutide displayed a 5-fold higher bioavailability and lower variability (71.5 % reduction in the coefficient of variation) compared to the commercially available oral tablet. These results suggest that enzymatic modulation of biological barriers holds promise as a strategy to improve non-invasive delivery of peptides and potentially other macromolecular drugs.",,,jleroux@ethz.ch.

Estrogen regulates multiple aspects of the nervous system including development, survival, and axonal outgrowth of DRG neurons. While previous studies have established estrogen's neuroprotective role in these neurons, the specific ER subtypes and downstream signaling pathways mediating these effects remain poorly defined. The objective of our study was to investigate the effects of 17 beta-estradiol (E2) on mitochondrial function and axonal regeneration of cultured DRG neurons and explore the pathways by which E2 acts. We observed that E2 treatment upregulated the levels of phosphorylated AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). E2 also increased the levels of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ coactivator-1α (PGC-1α) and activating transcription factor 3 (ATF3), which are proteins involved in mitochondrial biogenesis and axonal regeneration. The Seahorse assay showed that E2 elevated basal respiration in cultured DRG neurons. Additionally, E2 treatment for 24 h significantly increased total neurite outgrowth of DRG neurons. Pharmacological inhibition of AMPK using Compound C inhibited E2-mediated increases in ATF3 expression and neurite outgrowth. The Ca",,,pfernyhough@sbrc.ca.

To ensure effective therapy, DMOAD delivery systems therefore must withstand repeated mechanical loading without altering the kinetics of drug release. While soft materials are typically preferred for DMOAD delivery, mechanical loading can compromise their structural integrity and disrupt controlled drug release. In this study, we present a mechanically resilient soft hydrogel that rapidly self-heals under conditions simulating human running while maintaining sustained release of the cathepsin-K inhibitor L-006235, used as a proof-of-concept DMOAD. This hydrogel demonstrated superior performance compared to a previously reported hydrogel designed for intra-articular drug delivery, which, in our study, neither recovered its structure nor maintained drug release under mechanical loading. When injected into mouse knee joints, the hydrogel provided consistent release kinetics of the encapsulated drug in both treadmill-running and nonrunning mice. In a mouse model of severe PTOA exacerbated by treadmill-running, the L-006235 hydrogel significantly reduced cartilage degeneration, whereas the free drug did not. Overall, our data underscore the hydrogel's potential for treating PTOA in physically active patients.",Eickhoff JP; Botelho L,Anton Paar USA,

We present analyses using benefit-risk methods to better understand the age-dependence of the benefit-risk profile of rivaroxaban in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) or venous thromboembolism (VTE). Randomized controlled trial data from the ROCKET-AF (NVAF) and EINSTEIN DVT, EINSTEIN PE, EINSTEIN-Extension, and EINSTEIN CHOICE in (VTE) were used. For ROCKET-AF, benefits and risks were assessed with incidence rates for key thrombotic and bleeding endpoints and a net clinical benefit (NCB) measure. Cumulative incidences (estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method) were estimated at day 185 for EINSTEIN and EINSTEIN Extension and 1 year for EINSTEIN CHOICE. Incidence differences were calculated for the overall population and age subgroups of < 65, 65-75, and > 75 years. In ROCKET-AF, rate differences in the composite NCB outcome (vascular death, stroke, myocardial infarction, fatal bleeding, critical organ bleeding, and non-CNS systemic embolism) favored rivaroxaban overall and by age < 65, 65-75, and > 75 years (-84, -25, -61, and -150 cases per 10,000 patient-years, respectively). In the pooled EINSTEIN DVT and EINSTEIN PE studies, cumulative incidence differences for the composite NCB outcome (recurrent VTE and major bleeding) were -103, 3, -105, and -544 per 10,000 patients, respectively. For extended VTE treatment with rivaroxaban versus placebo in EINSTEIN-Extension, NCB results were -536, -492, -556, and -601 per 10,000 patients, respectively. In the EINSTEIN CHOICE analysis, NCB favored rivaroxaban 20 mg versus aspirin (-284, -255, -339, and -338, respectively) and rivaroxaban 10 mg versus aspirin (-339, -328, -485, and -80, respectively). This analysis demonstrated a positive benefit-risk profile with rivaroxaban versus trial comparators in older patients with NVAF or VTE, with benefit-risk increasingly favoring rivaroxaban with increasing age. http://ClinicalTrials.gov , identifiers: NCT00403767 (ROCKET-AF), NCT00440193 (EINSTEIN DVT), NCT00439777 (EINSTEIN PE), NCT00439725 (EINSTEIN Extension), and NCT02064439 (EINSTEIN CHOICE). Anticoagulants are medications that prevent blood clots. They can treat or prevent health problems caused by abnormal blood clotting. Anticoagulants can be used to prevent stroke in patients who have a heart condition called atrial fibrillation (AF). They can also treat or prevent blood clots that form in the veins called venous thromboembolism (VTE). As patients get older, their risk of stroke or blood clots increases. Although anticoagulants are helpful for these conditions, they can cause bleeding. The risk of bleeding increases with age and certain other diseases, such as heart failure, diabetes, and high blood pressure. When choosing an anticoagulant, it is important to look at both the benefits (reducing blood clots) and risks (bleeding) of the drug. Research studies have tested the efficacy and safety of the anticoagulant rivaroxaban by comparing it against standard treatment in patients with AF (ROCKET-AF study) and VTE (EINSTEIN studies). Our analysis used data from these studies to focus on specific outcomes related to rivaroxaban’s benefits and risks. This analysis compared the frequency of these outcomes between different treatments in all patients and in patients who were younger than 65, 65–75, and older than 75 years of age. In patients with AF or VTE, rivaroxaban had higher benefits than risks overall and for each of the age groups studied. The positive differences between benefits and risks of rivaroxaban appeared to grow in older groups of patients. These results suggest that rivaroxaban’s treatment benefits outweigh the risks in older patients.",Volkl AA; Pap ÁF; Damaraju CV; Levitan B; Yuan Z,Bayer AG; Johnson & Johnson,pdobesh@unmc.edu.

This pathway is dependent on multi-ligand receptors: megalin and cubilin. Abnormalities in genes associated with endocytosis in the proximal tubule can lead to tubular proteinuria, where the urine contains albumin and low-molecular-weight proteins. Dent disease is a hereditary X-linked disorder characterized by low-molecular-weight proteinuria, hypercalciuria, nephrocalcinosis, nephrolithiasis, and progressive kidney dysfunction, often leading to CKD stage 5. CLCN5 is the gene responsible for Dent disease-1 and encodes the voltage-gated chloride channel ClC-5. Meanwhile, OCRL is the causative gene of Dent disease-2 and encodes phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate 5-phosphatase, and its variants are also associated with Lowe syndrome. ClC-5 and OCRL are essential to the endocytic machinery, and their loss affects endosomal acidification and trafficking, resulting in disruption of megalin and cubilin recycling. CUBN, which encodes cubilin, was originally identified as the causative gene of Imerslund-Gräsbeck syndrome, a disorder of megaloblastic anemia associated with proteinuria. However, recently, a biallelic C-terminal variant of CUBN was shown to be responsible for isolated proteinuria without kidney dysfunction. This proteinuria is recognized as a new disease concept called chronic benign proteinuria (proteinuria, chronic benign: PROCHOB), which contradicts the common belief that proteinuria is harmful and ultimately leads to kidney damage. This article deepens the understanding of genetic tubular proteinuria and its origins, focusing on the role of megalin- and cubilin-mediated endocytosis in the proximal tubule.",,,nsakaki@med.kobe-u.ac.jp.

To assess whether prenatal use of smoking cessation pharmacotherapies was associated with increased risks of major congenital malformations (MCMs). This retrospective cohort study was conducted across 4 countries, and results were pooled via meta-analyses. Records of all births (2001-2020) in New South Wales (NSW; Australia), New Zealand (NZ), Norway, and Sweden were linked to prescribed medicine dispensings, hospital admission, outpatient, and death data. Follow-up ended December 31, 2021, and the data were analyzed between August and October 2023. The base cohort comprised 391 474 infants among 267 522 women who smoked during the first trimester or were dispensed a smoking cessation pharmacotherapy 90 days before conception or during the first trimester.

Analyses included 9325 infants exposed to NRT (NSW, NZ), 3031 to varenicline (NSW, NZ, Norway, and Sweden), and 1042 to bupropion (NSW, NZ). Compared with unexposed infants, there were no differences in prevalence of MCMs overall following NRT exposure (37.6 vs 34.4 per 1000 live births; adjusted relative risk [aRR], 1.10; 95% CI, 0.98-1.22), varenicline (32.7 vs 36.6; aRR, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.73-1.10), or bupropion (35.5 vs 38.8; aRR, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.67-1.29). NRT analyses showed no difference in the risk of MCMs of the heart, limbs, genital organs, kidney/urinary tract, respiratory system, and orofacial clefts but a higher risk of digestive organ MCMs (3.8 vs 2.5 per 1000 live births; aRR, 1.53; 95% CI, 1.05-2.23; P = .41 after multiple comparison adjustment). Varenicline analyses revealed no difference in the risk of heart, limb, and genital MCMs but a higher risk of kidney/urinary tract MCMs (11.5 vs 4.2 per 1000 live births; aRR, 2.75; 95% CI, 1.42-5.34; P = .09 after multiple comparison adjustment), with findings for other MCMs being too imprecise. For bupropion, data were too sparse to estimate the risk of MCM subgroups.

We analysed independent risk factors and longitudinal changes in OCS usage among patients with asthma to predict future risks of OCS-related adverse outcomes. Optimum Patient Care Research Database United Kingdom primary care electronic medical records (EMR) from January 1990 to June 2021 were used to select adults (18-93 years) with asthma who had follow-up data from ≥2 years before to ≥3 years after an index visit for active symptoms; this date was defined by the largest pre-visit to post-visit change in mean annual OCS use. OCS usage during every follow-up year was categorised as none, low (mean <2 prescriptions/year), or high (mean ≥2 prescriptions/year). Pre-index to post-index changes between usage categories were calculated. Risk modelling selected cohorts without 17 morbidities (documented pre-index) reported to be associated with OCS exposure, including type 2 diabetes, osteoporosis, hypertension, and pneumonia. Cox regression analyses selected published risk factors associated with each condition and available in EMR for inclusion in proportional hazards models. The pre-index to post-index OCS usage category remained unchanged in 38.6% of patients, increased in 39.2%, and decreased in 22.2%, with 20.7% having no further OCS prescriptions. In models, the risks of all adverse outcomes increased with projected categoric OCS use; for example, hazard ratios for a one-category increment (none to low, low to high) were 1.55 (1.42-1.69) for type 2 diabetes, 1.56 (1.36-1.78) for post-menopausal osteoporosis, 1.05 (1.00-1.10) for hypertension, and 1.67 (1.52-1.83) for pneumonia (all p < 0.001). OCS exposure in this primary care asthma population usually continued longitudinally. Our models predict increased risk of multiple morbidities with higher projected OCS exposure. These findings support early initiation of strategies to minimise OCS use in asthma.",Chapaneri J; Khezrian M; Maslova E; Patel S,BioPharmaceutical Medical,

Against the backdrop of drug centralized procurement policy, considering the effect of health insurance reimbursement and market competition ferocity, this study constructs a differential game model of a secondary drug supply chain comprising two competing drug companies and a single healthcare institution. In addition, this study comparatively analyzes the optimal equilibrium strategies and supply chain profit levels of drug research and development investment and healthcare service efforts under four government subsidy modes, further discussing them along with arithmetic examples. It is found that the government's subsidy behavior markedly influenced drug companies' investment in drug research and development and healthcare institution' service cost investment. Besides, different incentives for supply chain members' decision-making and profits were noted in different markets with different competition intensities. In the low-intensity competition market, the government's subsidies to innovative drug companies generate much higher social welfare than other modes. In the high-intensity competition market, the government subsidized healthcare institution can minimize the mutually exclusive effects of subsidies on the development of innovative and generic drug companies, and eventually drive the reform and development of the entire drug industry.",,,

The exact role of macrophage polarization and different cytokine production in the pathophysiology associated with COVID-19 induced ARDS or pulmonary fibrosis is unknown. It is necessary to identify potential biomarkers that can predict the progress of pulmonary fibrosis or other adverse consequences. We analyze the plasma samples obtained from healthy individuals and COVID-19 patients who were stratified according to the disease severity and fibrotic-like changes on chest computed tomography (CT) scans. Surfactant Protein D (SP-D), Matrix Metalloproteinase 8 (MMP8), Krebs von den lungen-6 (KL-6), Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2), and macrophage polarization-related biomarkers were determined by ELISA. Data were collected and evaluated using regression models and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. The plasma levels of SP-D, MMP8 in patients with ARDS were higher than those of non-ARDS patients. Patients with pulmonary fibrosis had higher plasma levels of SP-D compared to those without fibrotic changes. Among the biomarkers indicative of macrophage polarization, compared to non-ARDS patients, a significant increase in IL-10, Inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), and Arginase-1 (Arg-1) were observed in ARDS patients, while Tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) was decreased. The plasma level of IL-10 was also elevated in patients with fibrotic changes on CT, and was positively correlated with ACE2 and Arg-1. ROC curve results uncovered that SP-D showed higher efficacy in predicting pulmonary fibrosis and ARDS compared to other inflammatory markers. And IL-10 had similar predictive value with traditional inflammatory indicators such as CRP and PCT.

We validated algorithms for early localized and disseminated LD, with and without LD-specific diagnosis codes, in states with high incidence and their neighboring states with low LD incidence. We identified cohorts of potential incident LD cases in administrative insurance claims data, October 2015-October 2023, in 1 national and 1 regional insurer. Three algorithms were studied: a primary algorithm of an LD-specific diagnosis code and indicated antibiotic and 2 secondary algorithms for disseminated LD requiring a non-LD-specific musculoskeletal or neurologic diagnosis code, an antibiotic, and an LD diagnostic test. We included individuals from high LD-incidence states and neighboring low LD-incidence states. We validated the algorithms using medical records for a sample of potential cases, classifying them according to modified surveillance case definitions. We calculated positive predictive values (PPVs) for each algorithm. Overall, we identified 9483 potential LD cases in claims data and reviewed 841 medical records. The PPVs for the primary algorithm were 90.7% and 81.3% in high-incidence and neighboring states, respectively, when suspect, probable, and confirmed cases were included; they were 76.6% and 28.0% when only confirmed and probable were included. For confirmed and possible cases, the secondary musculoskeletal algorithm PPVs were 12.9% and 4.1%, and the secondary neurologic algorithm PPVs were 6.2% and 1.8% in high-incidence and neighboring states, respectively.

This study investigated the relationship between peripheral GlcA levels and clinical characteristics in patients with SCZ and assess whether these associations persist independently of psychotropic medication effects to provide insight into the potential role of GlcA in the pathophysiology of SCZ. Plasma GlcA levels were analysed in 218 patients with SCZ, examining their association with clinical features. The correlation between GlcA levels and symptom severity, assessed using the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), was analysed in 35 patients. In addition, multiple regression analysis was conducted to adjust for age and psychotropic medication effects. Significant correlations were observed between GlcA levels and PANSS scores for negative symptoms, general psychopathology and total scores. After adjustment for age and psychotropic medications, significant correlations between GlcA levels and PANSS scores persisted for negative symptoms (adjusted β [95% CI], 13.926 [2.369, 25.483]) and general psychopathology (adjusted β [95% CI], 19.437 [3.884, 34.990]), while the total score was no longer significant (adjusted β [95% CI], 34.054 [-0.517, 68.626]).

The end points would be considered statistically significant if they fulfilled at least 1 of the following conditions: (1) P ≤ .05 for all 3 of the end point comparisons, (2) P ≤ .025 for 2 of the end point comparisons, or (3) P ≤ .0167 for any of the 3 end point comparisons (Hochberg procedure). Of the 1105 participants (mean age, 70 years [SD, 12 years]; 33% were women), cardiovascular death or first heart failure hospitalization (first primary outcome) occurred in 141 in the ferric carboxymaltose group vs 166 in the placebo group (hazard ratio, 0.79 [95% CI, 0.63-0.99]; P = .04). The second primary outcome (total heart failure hospitalizations) occurred 264 times in the ferric carboxymaltose group vs 320 times in the placebo group (rate ratio, 0.80 [95% CI, 0.60-1.06]; P = .12). The third primary outcome (cardiovascular death or first heart failure hospitalization in patients with a transferrin saturation <20%) occurred in 103 patients in the ferric carboxymaltose group vs 128 patients in the placebo group (hazard ratio, 0.79 [95% CI, 0.61-1.02], P = .07). A similar amount of patients had at least 1 serious adverse event in the ferric carboxymaltose group (269; 48.2%) vs in the placebo group (273; 49.9%) (P = .61). In patients with heart failure and iron deficiency, ferric carboxymaltose did not significantly reduce the time to first heart failure hospitalization or cardiovascular death in the overall cohort or in patients with a transferrin saturation less than 20%, or reduce the total number of heart failure hospitalizations vs placebo.

It is unknown how macronutrient substitution affects plasma kynurenines, which may be relevant for developing guidelines to improve post-CRC quality of life through dietary changes. Using iso-caloric substitution models, we investigated how substituting one macronutrient with another is longitudinally associated with plasma tryptophan, kynurenines, and kynurenine ratios in CRC survivors. Measurements were performed at 6-weeks, 6-months, and 12-months post-treatment in 247 stage I-III CRC survivors. Macronutrient intake was measured by 7-d dietary records and plasma kynurenines by LC/MS-MS. For analysis, we applied linear mixed models with false discovery rate (FDR) to adjust for multiple testing. After FDR adjustment, substituting 100 kcal/d of total carbohydrates with 100 kcal/d of total protein was associated with higher plasma concentrations of kynurenic acid (KA), xanthurenic acid (XA), and a higher kynurenic acid-to-quinolinic acid (KA/QA) ratio. Substituting 100 kcal/d of total carbohydrates with 100 kcal/d of total fat was associated with higher tryptophan concentrations, higher KA/QA ratio, and a lower kynurenine-to-tryptophan ratio (KTR) and hydroxykynurenine ratio (HKr). Substituting 100 kcal/d of total fat with 100 kcal/d of total protein was associated with higher XA concentrations. Altogether, iso-caloric macronutrient substitutions, particularly substituting carbohydrates with protein or fat, were longitudinally associated with higher concentrations of potentially favourable kynurenines and ratios (i.e., KA, XA, and KA/QA ratio) and lower ratios with pro-inflammatory or neurotoxic properties (i.e., KTR and HKr) in CRC survivors up to 12-months post-treatment.",Ueland PM; Konsten JL; Keulen ETP; McCann A,Department of Internal Medicine and Gastroenterology; Department of Surgery; Bevital AS,d.holthuijsen@maastrichtuniversity.nl.

Infectious diseases,10.1016/S1473-3099(25)00070-2,"The intention-to-diagnose principle, an analogue to the intention-to-treat principle in clinical trials, protects the foundation for inference in diagnostic test accuracy studies. This foundation provides for robust control of error rates during hypothesis testing and correct coverage probability during confidence interval estimation of accuracy parameters, in well defined populations for transparent generalisability. The intention-to-diagnose principle requires distinguishing between various non-positive non-negative (NPNN) test results, such as equivocal and invalid results, and appropriate handling of these distinct results during statistical analyses. Pragmatic application accuracy, pragmatic scientific accuracy, and explanatory scientific accuracy are three major research foci in studies of diagnostic test accuracy. Selection of appropriate analysis sets and appropriate handling of NPNN results depend on the specific focus. Selection has important implications regarding preservation of the foundation for statistical inference, generalisability, and comparability with results from other studies. We recommended analyses for diagnostic accuracy studies that include the estimation of accuracy parameters associated with each research foci. A free online tool is available to estimate these accuracy parameters. As with dedicated commitment to the intention-to-treat principle in clinical trials, commitment to application of the intention-to-diagnose principle will lead to studies with high integrity, a comprehensive understanding of the scientific and administration characteristics of the diagnostic test, clarity of interpretation and generalisability, and better clinical decision making.",Petrides V; Meier K; Galicia NP,Foundation Medicine; Silver Spring; Abbott,sevans@bsc.gwu.edu.

This study aimed to evaluate the prognostic impact of acute PS deterioration in patients with untreated advanced NSCLC. This study is a single center, retrospective, observational study. Patients with Stage IV NSCLC who were referred to our institution between January 2018 and March 2023 were retrospectively reviewed. Patients were divided into three groups: 1) patients with PS 0 or 1 at referral and the start of chemotherapy; 2) patients with PS 2 or worse at initial referral and the start of chemotherapy; and 3) patients with PS 0 or 1 at referral that deteriorated to PS 2 or worse at the start of chemotherapy. The prognoses of Groups 2 and 3 were compared with those of Group 1. A total of 373 patients were included: 321 in Group 1, 20 in Group 2, and 32 in Group 3. The median overall survival (OS) of Group 3 was shorter than that of Group 1 (9.3 vs. 27.1 months, hazard ratio [HR] 2.56, p < 0.01). The median OS of Group 2 was also shorter than that of Group 1, although not as significant as in Group 3 (20.2 vs. 27.1 months, HR 1.68, p = 0.06).

Angiopoietin-like protein 3 (ANGPTL3) inhibits lipoprotein and endothelial lipases, and Mendelian randomization studies associate lower ANGPTL3 activity with lower triglycerides, and lower cardiovascular risk. The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of solbinsiran, an N-acetylgalactosamine-conjugated small interfering RNA developed to inhibit hepatic translation of ANGPTL3 messenger RNA (mRNA), on ANGPTL3 and lipid levels in preclinical models and humans. In preclinical studies, the impact of solbinsiran on ANGPTL3 levels was assessed in mouse and nonhuman primate models. The phase 1 clinical study enrolled participants with mixed dyslipidemia. In the single-ascending-dose study, participants received single subcutaneous doses of solbinsiran (24-960 mg) or matching placebo. In the repeat-dose study, subcutaneous solbinsiran (208 or 480 mg) or matching placebo on days 1 and 29 was evaluated. Safety, pharmacokinetics, and effect on levels of ANGPTL3 and lipid parameters were evaluated over 169 days. In mice transiently expressing human ANGPTL3, a single dose of solbinsiran reduced hepatocyte ANGPTL3 mRNA expression by 65% vs vehicle-treated mice. In cynomolgus monkeys, mean ± SEM reductions in hepatic ANGPTL3 mRNA expression up to 73% ± 2% (P < 0.0001) and serum ANGPTL3 protein expression up to 69% ± 4% (P < 0.001) were seen vs vehicle-treated monkeys. In humans, a single dose of solbinsiran resulted in dose-dependent mean percentage reductions from baseline in ANGPTL3 up to 86% ± 4%, triglycerides up to 73% ± 7%, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol up to 30% ± 16%, non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol up to 41% ± 12%, and apolipoprotein B up to 30% ± 11%, with sustained effects at higher doses (P < 0.0001 for all). The repeat-dose study demonstrated reductions in ANGPTL3 of 89% ± 6%, triglycerides up to 70% ± 13%, LDL cholesterol up to 42% ± 14%, non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol up to 46% ± 14%, and apolipoprotein B up to 36% ± 13% (P < 0.0001 for all). Nuclear magnetic resonance lipoprotein analysis demonstrated reductions in the total number of triglyceride-rich lipoprotein and LDL particles with solbinsiran. Adverse events were mostly mild in severity, with similar incidence in solbinsiran- and placebo-treated participants. Solbinsiran inhibits hepatic ANGPTL3 translation and results in significant reductions in all atherogenic lipoproteins in mixed dyslipidemia. The impact of this approach on cardiovascular outcomes remains to be determined.

Primary outcome was number of self-reported moderate asthma exacerbations 12 months pre-index, overall, by maintenance treatment class and asthma control status at index, using the Asthma Control Test (ACT; poor [< 16], somewhat controlled [16-18], and controlled [> 19]) and 6-item Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ-6; uncontrolled [≥ 1.50], partially controlled [> 0.75-<1.50], and controlled [≤ 0.75]). Secondary outcomes included index ACT and ACQ-6 score, healthcare resource utilisation (HCRU) and direct costs 12 months pre- and post-index, stratified by self-reported moderate exacerbation frequency pre-index. Of 485 patients with ≥ 12 months' pre-index data, 86.6% (n = 420) self-reported moderate exacerbations, with similar frequency irrespective of maintenance treatment class (66.7-100.0%; ICS/LABA: 85.4%). Numerically greater proportions of patients self-reported a moderate exacerbation in the 12 months pre-index in ACT poor-control (n = 110/115 [95.7%]) and ACQ-6-uncontrolled (n = 200/210 [95.3%]) versus ACT- and ACQ-6-controlled (n = 205/260 [78.8%], n = 105/145 [72.4%]) groups. Symptom control worsened with increasing exacerbation frequency: mean (SD) ACT scores were 21.8 (3.3) and 15.7 (4.4) for patients with 0 or ≥ 7 events, respectively; mean (SD) ACQ-6 scores followed the same trend.

This study examined differences in nosocomial-onset urinary tract-related bloodstream infections (UTRBSIs) and catheter-related bloodstream infections (CRBSIs) between patients admitted to long-term and acute care wards. This retrospective cohort study was conducted at a mixed-care hospital with long-term and acute care wards from April 2015 to March 2024. Patient backgrounds, causative pathogens, antibiotic resistance, and treatment patterns were compared between the two groups. Among the 252 patients, 108 (42.9 %) were diagnosed with UTRBSIs and 87 (34.5 %) with CRBSIs. In UTRBSIs, the long-term care group had significantly longer hospitalization (721 vs. 16 days, P < 0.001), more frequent use of indwelling urinary catheters (76.7 % vs. 28.6 %, P < 0.001), and higher isolation rates of extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing Enterobacterales (41.1 % vs. 8.6 %, P < 0.001). Piperacillin/tazobactam and meropenem were significantly more frequently used empirically in the long-term care group. In CRBSIs, the isolation rates of main causative pathogens, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) (9.5 % vs. 6.7 %, P = 0.707) and methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative Staphylococcus spp. (40.5 % vs. 48.9 %, P = 0.519), showed no significant differences between the two groups despite differences in patient backgrounds. Anti-MRSA agents were rarely used empirically in both groups (19.0 % vs. 15.6 %, P = 0.779). Patients admitted to long-term care wards may require empirical therapy for UTRBSIs targeting drug-resistant Enterobacterales, while for CRBSIs, empirical use of anti-MRSA agents may be considered, similar to patients admitted to acute care wards.",,,kumagai.kohei.ae@mail.hosp.go.jp.

The validated National Eye Institute Visual Function Questionnaire (VFQ) may be used to evaluate patients' perceptions of how vision impairment affects their lives. To compare vision-related quality of life in AQP4+ NMOSD and MOGAD using the NEI-VFQ. Participants with AQP4+ NMOSD and MOGAD, 18 years of age and older, were enrolled through the Canadian NMOSD and other atypical demyelinating diseases cohort study (CANOPTICS) at six Canadian centers and consented to enter the patient-reported outcomes sub-study. Participants completed the VFQ at study entry. We compared composite VFQ scores and subscale scores in all participants with NMOSD and MOGAD, those with a history of any ON, and those with a history of bilateral simultaneous ON. We used a multivariable linear regression model to evaluate the association of VFQ composite score with disease type (NMOSD versus MOGAD), age, sex at birth, disease duration, history of unilateral ON, history of bilateral ON, and visual functional system score (FSS). There were 58 NMOSD participants, 49 (84.5 %) female, mean (SD) age 48.6 (14.8) years, and 42 MOGAD participants, 27 (64.3 %) female, mean (SD) age 45.2(15.1) years. Thirty-five (60.3 %) participants with NMOSD had a history of any ON and 11(19.0 %) of bilateral ON. For MOGAD, 30 (71.4 %) participants had a history of any ON and 14 (33.3 %) of bilateral ON. Mean (SD) VFQ composite scores were 82.2 (17.9) in NMOSD and 83.7 (17.6) in MOGAD for the full cohort; 75.0 (19.9) in NMOSD and 80.4 (18.7) in MOGAD for those with any history of ON; and 70.2 (25.6) in NMOSD and 74.9 (21.8) in MOGAD for bilateral ON. Composite scores did not differ significantly between participants with NMOSD and MOGAD in the full cohort or ON sub-groups. However, history of bilateral ON (β=-13.2, p = 0.0008) and higher visual FSS (β=-4.9, p < 0.0001) were associated with lower VFQ composite scores. In this Canadian multi-center cohort, vision-related quality of life was impaired in both NMOSD and MOGAD, without significant differences observed in scores. Vision-related quality of life assessment offers unique insights into the functional impact of vision loss, and should be considered as an outcome measure to evaluate visual disability in NMOSD and MOGAD in addition to visual acuity.",,,dalia.rotstein@unityhealth.to.
40156867,A deep learning model trained on expressed transcripts across different tissue types reveals cell-type codon-optimization preferences.,2025-05-15,Nucleic acids research,10.1093/nar/gkaf233,"Species-specific differences in protein translation can affect the design of protein-based drugs. Consequently, efficient expression of recombinant proteins often requires codon optimization. Publicly available optimization tools do not always result in higher expression levels and can lead to protein misfolding and reduced expression. Here, we aimed to develop a novel deep learning (DL) tool using a recurrent neural network (RNN) to define cell type-dependent codon biases. Using gene expression data from three different tissue types (brain, liver, and muscle) and all secretory genes, we trained DL models to predict optimal codon usage. Codon-optimized sequences for test reporter genes exhibited enhanced protein expression compared to their original sequences and those optimized using a publicly available tool. Interestingly, DL models trained on genes expressed in liver cells (hepatocytes) resulted in the highest levels of expression when tested in vitro, irrespective of the cell type. Our findings also demonstrate that DL-based codon optimization algorithms can significantly enhance protein translation, particularly for secretory proteins, which are crucial for therapeutic applications. This research represents a novel approach to codon optimization with broader implications for protein-based pharmaceuticals, vaccine manufacturing, gene therapy, and other recombinant DNA products.",,,

A previous study demonstrated the safe and effective subcutaneous self-injection of 320 mg bimekizumab via two 1 mL (2 × 160 mg) doses using safety syringe (SSy) or auto-injector (AI) devices. Delivery of 320 mg bimekizumab via a single 2 mL self-injection could lead to an improved treatment experience for patients. We describe the results from four studies. Two self-injection experience studies (DV0002 [n = 38] and DV0006 [n = 89], sub-studies of the phase 3 study BE BRIGHT [NCT03598790]) assessed the safe and effective self-administration of bimekizumab at week 8 and baseline, as well as patient self-injection experience and pain, in patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis using the 2 mL SSy or AI. Additionally, we report on two bioequivalence studies (UP0068 [n = 71] and UP0119 [n = 121]) that describe pharmacokinetic profiles for two 1 mL injections and a single 2 mL injection, delivered by SSy or AI devices in healthy participants. All patients were able to administer safe and effective self-injections at baseline and week 8 using the different 2 mL devices, except one patient that administered an incomplete dose as a result of injection site pain that was mild. Overall, bimekizumab was generally well tolerated and all adverse device effects reported were mild and did not lead to discontinuation. Patients reported a positive self-injection experience with low pain scores (all ≤ 12.0/100). Bioequivalence was demonstrated for bimekizumab between a single 2 mL injection and two 1 mL injections, using both the SSy and AI. The 2 mL SSy and AI devices offer patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis two different safe and effective options for the delivery of bimekizumab, empowering individuals to select a device on the basis of personal preference. Graphical abstract available for this article. ClinicalTrials.gov identifier, NCT03766685. Plaque psoriasis is a skin disease that causes red, scaly skin patches that can flake, itch and hurt. It affects around 90% of people with psoriasis, and symptoms can negatively impact quality of life. Therefore, individuals want effective and easy to deliver treatment options. Bimekizumab is a medication used to treat psoriasis. Currently, each dose (320 mg) of bimekizumab is delivered via two 1 mL self-injections. These studies investigated whether a single 2 mL self-injection with one of two devices (safety syringe or auto-injector) could deliver the medication safely and effectively and whether a single 2 mL injection works in the same way as delivering bimekizumab with two injections. These studies were conducted because it is important to give patients options for their treatment delivery to suit their personal preferences and to reduce the number of injections required, minimising the burden of treatment. Everyone except one person was able to safely and effectively self-inject using both 2 mL devices. On average, people involved in the study reported a positive experience and low levels of pain (all ≤ 12.0/100) with both devices. Bimekizumab was well tolerated, and any reactions assessed to be related to the injection devices were mild and did not stop anyone receiving the treatment. A 320 mg dose of bimekizumab behaved similarly in the body when delivered by two 1 mL injections or a single 2 mL injection using either the safety syringe or auto-injector.",Sebastian M; Hoepken B; Knapp B; Bicer C; MacPherson M,UCB; Dermatology Practice,juliaseb@aol.com.

One hundred eighty patients with uterine corpus or cervical cancer who were scheduled to receive treatment with a cisplatin based regimen as initial chemotherapy were enrolled across 17 Japanese institutions. Patients were randomized with a 1:1 equal allocation ratio to the rikkunshito group or placebo groups and given oral administration on days 1 to 5 with standard antiemetics (granisetron, aprepitant, and dexamethasone). The primary endpoint was complete response (CR; no vomiting or rescue medication) during the delayed phase (24-120 hours after cisplatin treatment). The secondary endpoints were complete control (CC; CR without significant nausea) and total control (TC; CR without nausea) rates during the overall (0-120 hours), acute (0-24 hours), and delayed phases, as well as the CR rate during the overall and acute phases, time to treatment failure, degree of nausea and appetite during the overall phase, and adherence to the intervention.

MCI PPRS had a hazard ratio (HR) of 6.97 [5.34, 9.12], with a discriminating power (C-index = 82.52%). AD PPRS had a HR of 5.74 [4.67, 7.05] (C-index = 88.15%). Both PPRSs were also significantly associated with cognitive changes, brain atrophy, and plasma AD biomarkers. Proteins in the MCI and AD PPRSs were involved in several pathways related to leukocyte, chemotaxis, immunity, inflammation, and cellular migration. This study suggests that PPRSs serve well to predict the risk of developing MCI and AD as well as cognitive changes and AD-related pathogenesis in the brain. PPRSs were developed for the risk of AD and AD preclinical stage, MCI. PPRSs were developed for MCI and AD associated with cognitive changes, loss of brain volume, and increasing level of plasma AD biomarkers.

This study examines the model and cost-effectiveness profile that led to these positive reimbursements. The cost-effectiveness model integrated data from daridorexant 50 mg phase III trials (studies 301 and 303) and the National Health and Wellness Survey (NHWS). Clinical parameters were the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) score and adverse events. Using the NHWS, ISI data were mapped to utility, healthcare resource use, and work productivity. Daridorexant 50 mg was priced at £1.40/day. The base-case time horizon was 1 year. A lifetime model explored long-term effects. Parameters, data inputs, structural uncertainty, and alternative scenarios are all presented. In the 12-months model compared with placebo, daridorexant was estimated to have an incremental cost of £389 and generate an additional 0.024 quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), resulting in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of £16,300 per additional QALY from a health service perspective. Due to selective attrition, the ICER improved to £9580 per QALY for those continuing treatment for >12 months. Adopting a societal productivity perspective, daridorexant was estimated to offer £596 (£330-£896) total productivity savings versus £411/year in treatment costs, leading to a situation of dominance. Lifetime modeling improved the long-term cost effectiveness of daridorexant under the assumption that any waning of treatment effect led to further dropout.

40153134,Cost-Effectiveness and Public Health Impact of Universal Prophylaxis with Nirsevimab Against Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) Infections in all Infants in Japan.,,Infectious diseases and therapy,10.1007/s40121-025-01134-1,"Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a common cause of lower respiratory tract disease, and the standard prevention strategy in Japan is limited to high-risk infants. Nirsevimab provides protection against medically attended (MA) RSV infection in healthy late-preterm and term infants and was approved in Japan in 2024. This study estimates the cost-effectiveness of universal immunization with nirsevimab in an all-infant population from the Japanese public healthcare payer perspective. A static decision analytic model, able to track costs and health outcomes in a cohort of infants, was adapted to the Japanese setting. The standard of care, palivizumab, administered to high-risk infants, was compared with nirsevimab administrated to all infants in the first year, and an additional increased dose of nirsevimab (200 mg) in the second season for high-risk infants. Differences in costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) were captured considering RSV-related MA health events requiring inpatient hospitalizations, emergency room visits, and primary care visits, as well as RSV-related complications. Sensitivity and scenario analyses were conducted to explore the robustness and uncertainty of the study. Assuming a price of ¥45,000 for nirsevimab, universal immunization with nirsevimab was found to be cost-effective with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of ¥4,537,256/QALY. At the Japanese willingness-to-pay threshold of ¥5,000,000, the economically justifiable price was ¥45,496. Using the societal perspective, the ICER decreased to ¥1,695,635/QALY. Nirsevimab has a substantial public health impact on RSV disease burden, reducing approximately 50% of RSV-associated health events in an all-infant population. The analysis demonstrated that universal prophylaxis strategy with nirsevimab would significantly reduce the health and economic burden associated with RSV among infants in Japan. At the assumed price, nirsevimab can provide a cost-effective prophylaxis option against RSV infection in an all-infant population not limited to infants born prematurely or with high risk.",Kieffer A; Soudani S; Arashiro T; Tadera C; Eymere S; Lemański T; Wang X,Health Economics and Outcomes Research; Health Economics and Value Assessment; Vaccines Medical,xinyu.wang@sanofi.com.

These patients face high hospitalization risks, impacting clinical outcomes and health care resources. The Effect of Sotagliflozin on Cardiovascular Events in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Post Worsening Heart Failure (SOLOIST-WHF) trial showed that sotagliflozin, a sodium-glucose cotransporter inhibitor, reduced rehospitalizations in patients with HF and diabetes mellitus. Although clinically beneficial, the economic impact of sotagliflozin from a payer perspective remains unclear, warranting further pharmacoeconomic analysis to guide managed care decisions. To quantify the budget impact of sotagliflozin for US payers over a 5-year time horizon. A payer-perspective budget impact model was developed to assess the financial impact of incorporating sotagliflozin for the treatment of patients recently hospitalized for HF with comorbid type 2 diabetes (T2D) over 5 years to US payer health plans. The study used a population reflecting the SOLOIST-WHF clinical trial, with economic parameters adjusted by payer mix (all payer, commercial, Medicare, and Medicaid). Health care resource utilization included hospitalization, emergency department (ED) visit, and adverse events' care. Economic outcomes examined the medical and pharmacy budget impact for payers at the per-user, per member per month (PMPM), and total plan costs levels. For a hypothetical 1-million-member all-payer plan, 1,516 patients hospitalized for HF with comorbid T2D would be eligible for sotagliflozin. For all-payer plans, annual per-user costs increased by $4,996 because of higher pharmacy costs ($8,260) but were partially offset by lower medical costs (-$2,608) because of reduced rehospitalization and ED visits from sotagliflozin. PMPM total budget impact of sotagliflozin would be $0.08 PMPM in year 1 and $0.38 in year 5, corresponding with total plan cost of $75,736 in year 1 and $378,681 by year 5. Commercial payer PMPM costs were lower ($0.02 in year 1; $0.11 in year 5), and higher for Medicare ($0.23 PMPM in year 1, increasing to 1.13 PMPM in year 5). Breakeven rebate rates ranged between 31.5% and 79.4%. Although sotagliflozin increases pharmacy costs for recently hospitalized HF patients with T2D, approximately 21%-68% of pharmacy costs were offset from reduced rehospitalization and ED visits.",Sikirica S,Lexicon Pharmaceuticals,

Over the past few decades, lung cancer research has greatly advanced our understanding of the disease. We now know that lung cancer is not just one type of cancer, but rather 20 or more unique types, each caused by different genetic mutations. For patients whose genetic tests do not find a specific target for treatment, immunotherapy (IO), often combined with chemotherapy, has become the preferred option.Our study focuses on understanding the outcomes of these patients outside of clinical trials. We used data from patients’ medical records, which were reviewed and abstracted by the doctors who treated them. We looked at patients who received IO or other treatments as their second option after their first treatment stopped working. We found that patients who received IO as their second treatment lived without their cancer getting worse for about 8.4 months, compared to 5.1 months for those who received other treatments. Overall, it was observed that patients who received IO lived for about 13.5 months, while those who received other treatments lived for about 7.7 months. A small group of patients who received IO both as their first and second treatment did not have any deaths during the study period.

40151622,Influence of Alcohol on the Intestinal Immune System.,2025-03-28,Alcohol research : current reviews,10.35946/arcr.v45.1.03,"Alcohol misuse is associated with disruption of the microbial homeostasis (dysbiosis) and microbial overgrowth in the gut, gut barrier disruption, and translocation of microbes into the systemic circulation. It also induces changes in regulatory mechanisms of the gut, which is the largest peripheral immune organ. The gut-liver axis is important for health and disease, and alterations in the intestinal immune system contribute to alcohol-associated liver disease (ALD). Understanding these changes might help discover new targets for drugs and therapeutic approaches. A systematic literature search was conducted in PubMed, Medline, and Embase of manuscripts published between January 2000 and November 2023 using the terms (""alcohol"" or ""ethanol"") AND (""immune"" or ""immunol"") AND (""intestine,"" ""colon,"" or ""gut""). Eligible manuscripts included studies and reviews that discussed the effects of ethanol on immune cells in the intestine. A total of 506 publications were found in the databases on November 20, 2023. After excluding duplicates and research not covering ALD (415 articles), 91 studies were reviewed. Also included were manuscripts covering specific immune cells in the context of ALD. Balancing immune tolerance vs. initiating an immune response challenges the intestinal immune system. Alcohol induces disruption of the intestinal barrier, which is accompanied by a thicker mucus layer and reduced anti-microbial peptides. This leads to longer attachment of bacteria to epithelial cells and consequently greater translocation into the circulation. Bacterial translocation activates the immune system, reducing the activity of regulatory T cells and inducing T helper 17 response via a variety of pathways. The role of innate immune cells, especially Type 3 innate lymphoid cells, and of specific B- and T-cell subsets in ALD remains elusive. Gut dysbiosis, translocation of viable bacteria and bacterial products into the circulation, and changes in the intestinal barrier have been linked to immune deficiency and infections in patients with cirrhosis. Modifying the intestinal immune system could reduce intestinal inflammation and alcohol-induced liver injury. Understanding the underlying pathophysiology can help to detect new targets for drugs and design therapeutic strategies.",,,

A total of 11 clinical isolates of S. saprophyticus and 30 wastewater samples were used to isolate three lytic phages (vB_SsapH-Golestan-100, vB_SsapH-Golestan101-M, and vB_SsapH-Golestan-105-M). The morphology, behavioral characteristics, and complete DNA genomes of these phages were analyzed. The microscopic images of the phages revealed that the sizes of their heads and tail lengths fell within the ranges of 90-111 nm and 234-266 nm, respectively. All phages exhibited high adsorption rates (99.5% in 15 min) and burst sizes (150-210 PFU per infected cell), with a potential for a narrow host range. Genomic analysis of Staphylococcus phages indicated a size of 136,433 base pairs (bp) with a guanine-cytosine (GC) content of 33.7% and 192 open reading frames (ORFs) for vB_SsapH-Golestan-100, 144,081 bp with a GC content of 29.6% and 205 ORFs for vB_SsapH-Golestan101-M, and 142,199 bp with a GC content of 30.6% and 203 ORFs for vB_SsapH-Golestan-105-M.

The heat removal and input in freezing, primary drying, and secondary drying are via contact between the product and shelves cooled or heated by a circulating working fluid such as silicone oil. This is slow, inefficient, and leads to non-uniform freezing and drying, especially in large-scale production systems. To address the current throughput limitations of conventional lyophilization, this collaborative project by Purdue University, Merck and IMA Life develops the next generation of tunable randomized-field microwave lyophilization system demonstrating significant acceleration over conventional freeze-drying processes. The system uses a microwave source delivering electromagnetic energy to the lyophilization chamber at frequencies between 8 GHz and 18 GHz at power levels below 400 W and mechanical stirrers for field randomization to achieve uniform heating. The frequency range is selected due to its greater efficiency for heating ice relative to traditional industrial microwave frequencies of 915 MHz and 2.45 GHz. During operation, temperature is measured directly using optical sensors, providing robust real-time product data. Closed-loop control algorithms enable direct control of the product temperature throughout the drying process, ensuring the material is dried at an optimal rate. The results of quasi-Random Field (qRF) microwave drying for several benchmark formulations, including an attenuated live virus vaccine, are presented and compared with the corresponding conventional lyophilization processes.

Participants who self-reported the need for genetic testing were then purposively sampled to complete a semi-structured virtual interview. We used an interpretive description approach and reflexive thematic analysis. We completed 19 interviews and found that participants' self-identified need for genetic testing was informed by their experiences with genetic information and the perceptions that genetic information is actionable (clinical utility) and has personal meaning (personal utility). Most participants would not be eligible for funded testing based on their personal and family history, however, they had unmet informational and psychological needs, indicating unmet need for genetic counseling. The public understanding of the need for genetic testing is complex and varied. Participants identified many benefits resulting from genetic testing which are not reflected in how need is operationalized in reimbursement decisions, however unmet expectations for testing contributed to medical distrust and dissatisfaction.",,,Jehannine.austin@ubc.ca.

In this study, OA was incorporated into liposomes (OA-LIP), chitosan (CHI) coated liposomes (CHI-OA-LIP), and CHI-polygalacturonic acid (PGA)-double-layered (PGA-CHI-OA-LIP). The in vitro semi-dynamic digestion, cell absorption and pre-protective function for the liver-injured mouse of liposomes were evaluated. Compared to OA-LIP (91.96 ± 0.45 %), the polysaccharides double-layered OA-LIP, PGA-CHI-OA-LIP (99.84 ± 0.22 %), significantly improved the encapsulation efficiency of OA and exhibited higher stability during storage at room temperature and at 4 °C. In the in vitro semi-dynamic digestion and Caco-2 cell model, compared to free OA (6.22 ± 1.17 %, 6.56 ± 2.35 μg/mL), PGA-CHI-OA-LIP increased the bioavailability and cell absorption rate to 45.78 ± 0.71 % and 27.62 ± 1.69 μg/mL, respectively. Furthermore, it can improve the antioxidant capacity of Caco-2 cells, up-regulate the level of transportable terpene-related genes. In the mouse liver injury model, PGA-CHI-OA-LIP effectively reduced the activities of AST (aspartate aminotransferase) and ALT (alanine aminotransferase), decreased inflammatory factors, and thus effectively alleviated the infiltration and necrosis of liver cells.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, such study designs were considered particularly appealing as there was an urgent global need to rapidly identify effective therapeutics. However, limited in vivo safety and efficacy data was available early in the pandemic to inform decisions. As part of the ACTIV-2 study, we implemented a phase 2/3 platform trial to evaluate multiple candidate treatments for non-hospitalized adults with COVID-19. In addition to an adequate safety profile, the decision to graduate an agent from phase 2 to phase 3 was based on showing treatment effects on clinical or laboratory markers. Decision criteria evolved over time as more data became available during the global pandemic. A seamless transition and approximately 20 % reduction in total sample size was achieved for one agent, amubarvimab plus romlusevimab.

Existing policy simulations have tried to assess the policy impacts on innovation based on either empirical estimates of elasticity of innovation from the literature or structural models estimating the joint distribution of expected revenue and expected costs at key stages of pharmaceutical development. Since investors exert significant influence on investment programs that companies advance in the real world, a program-level analysis of how investors make their investment decisions can inform the key assumptions for policy simulations and generate more realistic insights. Using an illustrative case example, we constructed a net present value (NPV) model to examine how Medicare price negotiation will impact discounted value and investment decisions at six key timepoints of new drug development, highlighting key factors in investor decision-making not explicitly considered in existing empirical literature or policy simulations. Our analyses showed that IRA would lead to a 40% reduction in the NPV at the time of launch. The reduction was greater in earlier stages of development due to expected dilution and discounting, resulting in discontinuing this project at earlier decision points. The case study demonstrated that the negative impacts of price negotiation at nine years were more pronounced for small-molecule assets in the earlier stages of development (e.g., preclinical or Phase 1) than those in the later stages, implying a possibly much larger impact on innovation than suggested by existing empirical literature and observed in the short term.",Xie RZ; Cameron T; Kolchinsky P,RA Capital Management,rxie@racap.com.

Given the complexity of CVRM spectrum diseases and the treatment landscape, treatment guidelines have been established to assist physicians in selecting the most appropriate treatment based on not only patients' primary disease but also their comorbidities. However, the impact of adherence to treatment guidelines on associated outcomes remains unclear. A systematic literature review was conducted to evaluate the impact of guideline-based treatment on clinical, economic, and quality-of-life (QoL) outcomes and related comorbidities in the CVRM spectrum or heart failure (HF) alone in individuals with T2DM. The MEDLINE, MEDLINE In-Process, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and EconLit electronic databases were searched to identify relevant peer-reviewed studies published in the United States, Canada, or Germany. The studies were screened and selected for inclusion or exclusion based on populations, interventions, comparators, and study design (PICOS) criteria. Of the 622 records identified, 28 publications met the inclusion criteria. In total, 11 and 16 studies reported adherence to clinical guidelines for T2DM and HF management, respectively. Adherence to T2DM and HF treatment guidelines decreased all-cause mortality and all-cause hospitalizations; furthermore, adherence to T2DM guidelines decreased hospitalizations due to HF, myocardial infarction, and stroke, and reduced T2DM-related long-term complications, while adherence to HF guidelines reduced hospitalizations due to HF. Evidence gaps were identified, including the need to assess the impact of guideline adherence on economic outcomes, the impact of adherence to diagnosis and monitoring guidelines, and the impact of guideline adherence on QoL outcomes.

Eliminating these acute pain events is a key outcome in SCD clinical trials; however, the definition of a vaso-occlusive crisis (VOC) or a vaso-occlusive event (VOE) has not been consistently applied, hampering comparisons of treatment efficacy between different therapeutic approaches. We have examined the degree to which differing definitions of vaso-occlusion in clinical trial endpoints impact efficacy outcomes. Descriptions of clinical endpoints related to vaso-occlusion and pain events were reviewed from trials of exagamglogene autotemcel (exa-cel), lovotibeglogene autotemcel (lovo-cel), renizgamglogene autogedtemcel (reni-cel), hydroxyurea, L-glutamine, voxelotor, and crizanlizumab. Patient-level data from the published exa-cel Phase 3 pivotal trial (CLIMB SCD-121; data cut 14 Jun 2023) was used to evaluate efficacy outcomes based on differing endpoint definitions of vaso-occlusion. In the seven clinical trials reviewed, definitions of vaso-occlusion and/or pain events varied by care setting, duration of care, treatments used, and associated complications, with the frequency and duration of medical facility visits for acute pain events being most dissimilar between trials. Definitions of severe VOCs (exa-cel), VOC (voxelotor), and sickle cell-related pain crises (SCPCs; crizanlizumab and L-glutamine) included pain events requiring a medical facility visit of any duration, whereas the definition of painful crises (hydroxyurea) required a medical facility visit of > 4 h and the definition of severe vaso-occlusive events (VOEs; lovo-cel and reni-cel) required a hospital or emergency room (ER) observation unit visit lasting ≥ 24 h or ≥ 2 visits to a day unit or ER over a 72-h period. Based on the definition of severe VOCs, 29/30 patients [96.7%; 95% confidence interval (CI): 82.8, 99.9] in the CLIMB SCD-121 trial were considered free from severe VOCs for ≥ 12 consecutive months, whereas when the severe VOEs definition was applied to the same data, all patients (30/30; 100.0%; 95% CI: 88.4, 100.0) were considered free from severe VOEs for ≥ 12 consecutive months. Differences exist in definitions of vaso-occlusion and pain events used in SCD clinical trials. Severe VOCs (exa-cel), VOC (voxelotor), and SCPCs (crizanlizumab and L-glutamine) were more broadly inclusive than severe VOEs (lovo-cel and reni-cel) or painful crisis (hydroxyurea). Clinically, these differences resulted in differing numbers of patients being considered free from vaso-occlusion pain events, underscoring the challenge in comparing frequencies of pain events across SCD clinical trials.",Imren S; Li N; Xuan F,Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated,Haydar.Frangoul@hcahealthcare.com.

The mechanism of action of decongestants potentially increases blood pressure, and these effects may be acute or chronic. However, no systematic reviews to date have comprehensively assessed the chronic blood pressure effects of adrenergic agonist oral decongestants as a drug class, despite their widespread non-prescription availability. Primary objective To assess the effects of adrenergic agonist oral decongestants on systolic and diastolic blood pressure compared to placebo. Secondary objective To assess the effects of adrenergic agonist oral decongestants on heart rate and withdrawals due to adverse effects. The Cochrane Hypertension Information Specialist searched the following databases for randomized controlled trials (RCT) up to July 2024: Cochrane Hypertension Specialised Register, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) via Cochrane Register of Studies, Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid Embase, and ClinicalTrials.gov. There were no language, publication year, or publication status restrictions. We included RCTs of at least seven days' duration with parallel groups (intervention and placebo) comparing adrenergic agonist oral decongestants versus placebo on blood pressure in people aged over six years. Two review authors (JJC and MC) independently assessed the trials for inclusion, extracted the data, and assessed the risk of bias from the included trials. In cases where there were disagreements, the third review author (JMW) adjudicated. For any missing or unclear information in the studies, we contacted the study author to request the missing information or seek clarification. The primary outcomes were systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure. Secondary outcomes were heart rate and withdrawal due to adverse effects. We used a fixed-effect model to combine the effect sizes from all studies. We assessed the certainty of the evidence using GRADE. Five RCTs randomizing 882 participants met the inclusion criteria. The shortest study duration was one week, and the longest study duration was 24 weeks. These studies measured blood pressure and heart rate after one to seven weeks of taking oral decongestants. The largest study included 568 people, and the smallest study included 18 people. The mean age of participants was 20.0 years, with 326 males and 591 females. The studies were conducted in the USA and Europe; most were set in the USA. Pharmaceutical companies funded three of the five included studies. The findings are relevant to all people using adrenergic agonist oral decongestants for seven days or longer regardless of comorbidities or pre-existing conditions. The adrenergic agonist oral decongestants included were ephedrine (one RCT), pseudoephedrine (one RCT), and phenylpropanolamine (three RCTs). Compared to placebo, adrenergic agonist oral decongestants may have little to no effect on systolic blood pressure, but the evidence is very uncertain (mean difference [MD] 0.91 mmHg, 95% confidence interval [CI] -0.57 to 2.38; 4 RCTs, 784 participants; I In this systematic review, chronic daily intake of adrenergic agonist oral decongestants had little to no effect on blood pressure, heart rate, and withdrawals due to adverse effects. People making decisions about using these medicines should consider the very low certainty of evidence and the theoretical risk of increased blood pressure. Independent trials free from biases that are designed to answer this question are required. The evidence was limited due to the small number of studies, and the blood pressure and heart rate not being measured at the optimal time after drug ingestion.",,,
40145327,Noninvasive Fibrin Targeting Colloid-Mediated Intra-Articular Repair.,2025-05-15,Journal of biomedical materials research. Part A,10.1002/jbm.a.37901,"Musculoskeletal knee injuries are common and debilitating, with the most prevalent soft tissue injuries being anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) and meniscal tears. These tears do not heal well naturally, and biological therapies involving scaffolds are often unsuccessful, due in part to the synovial fluid environment of the joint. Viscous synovial fluid contains high concentrations of degradative enzymes, including plasmin, which prevents the stable formation of provisional fibrin scaffolds. Lack of provisional scaffold formation prevents bridging of torn tissue and subsequent remodeling for permanent tissue repair. Coagulation factors such as fibrinogen and thrombin, reinforced with synthetic platelet-like particles (PLPs), can be introduced to synovial fluid to promote fibrin scaffold formation. PLPs bind to and retract fibrin fibers to enhance stiffness, density, and stability of fibrin scaffolds. Therefore, the objective of this work is to investigate the role of PLPs in enhancing fibrin scaffold formation and degradation capabilities within synovial fluid and to characterize the resulting scaffold structure, density, and mechanics. We investigated effects in synovial fluid with high or low viscosity, as viscosity can change with injury and can vary between individuals. Following the addition of clotting factors and PLPs to synovial fluid, we found an increase in fibrin scaffold density, structure, and maximum mechanics for low viscosity, but not high viscosity, synovial fluid groups. Furthermore, by lowering the viscosity of synovial fluid with hyaluronidase, the increase in scaffold density following PLP addition was restored, indicating the strong role of synovial fluid viscosity on stable scaffold formation. This technology contributes to the development of a more robust fibrin-based therapy for intra-articular musculoskeletal injuries.",,,

It examined the implications of the JCA process for jurisdictional submission strategies, and decision-making across Europe. The study aimed at identifying key measures for an efficient and effective JCA process to enable national rollout. A survey was conducted with international pharmaceutical companies, followed by a multi-stakeholder workshop that expanded on the findings. The survey and workshop focused on key areas such as time to market, submission strategies, and the role of JCA in national decision-making processes. Descriptive and qualitative analyses were performed to identify recommendations for measuring and improving the JCA process. 13 companies responded to the survey, respondents were generally prepared for the JCA process (readiness rated 6-7/10), but concerns persist about timeline uncertainties and timely JCA report delivery. In the short term, success for the HTAR from the company perspective is measured by positive recommendations across EU jurisdictions. Long term, the focus shifts to aligning HTA methodologies and evidence requirements across the EU. Establishing metrics to assess the efficiency and effectiveness of the JCA is a key step in the HTAR's ongoing learning journey. To enhance the efficiency of the JCA process, a list of metrics is recommended for continuous improvement, as well as establishing training programs to strengthen member states' capabilities, fostering open dialog for sharing technology-specific insights, and creating open-source tools to support companies. Additionally, research should be conducted to understand agencies' expectations of the JCA and how they will use its reports, grouping agencies by archetype to identify trends. A key recommendation is the development of a product-based scorecard to evaluate JCA submissions and reviews from various perspectives, ensuring the process meets stakeholders' needs and can be effectively utilized in national decision-making. The JCA process offers a significant opportunity to streamline HTA decision-making across Europe. This study highlights several key measures and consideration for its successful rollout, including the need for clearer communication about the role of JCA in national decisions, measurement of rollout time components, and the development of quality evaluation frameworks. A collaborative, iterative approach, where stakeholders continually refine the system, will be essential for its effectiveness. Addressing these challenges will enable the JCA to enhance efficiency, consistency, and ultimately improve access to treatments for patients.",Wang T; McAuslane N,Centre for Innovation in Regulatory Science (CIRS),nmcauslane@cirsci.org.

In a retrospective analysis of 163 OHT recipients (40 exposed to SGLT2i, 123 not exposed), we show no increase in rates of mild, moderate, or severe acidosis postoperatively. No cases of ketoacidosis occurred, likely due to the fact that 97% of patients received insulin infusions postoperatively for transient postoperative hyperglycemia. Patients exposed to SGLT2i had shorter length of stay in the intensive care unit and improved adjusted survival overall. These findings support the safety of SGLT2i use up to the time of OHT with routine use of a postoperative insulin infusion.",,,

As shape is important for function, identifying cytocompatible, shrink-resistant materials are a major aim. Here, it is shown that hydrogels made of interpenetrating networks of collagen-I and recombinant spider silk protein eADF4(C16)-RGD nanofibrils exhibit synergistic and tunable mechanical properties. Composite hydrogels allow cell adhesion and spreading and are resistant to shrinkage mediated by fibroblasts, C2C12 myoblasts, and human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived cardiomyocytes. Myoblasts differentiate and fuse into myotubes, and hiPSC-cardiomyocytes can be cultured long-term, show spontaneous contractions, and remain drug responsive. Collectively, a novel composite material is developed to overcome the challenge of post-fabrication matrix shrinkage conferring high shape fidelity suitable for tissue engineering.",,,
40143307,Genome and Pathogenicity Analysis of an NADC30-like PRRSV Strain in China's Xinjiang Province.,2025-03-27,Viruses,10.3390/v17030379,"The porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) possesses an inherent ability to adapt to environmental transformations and undergo evolutionary changes, which has imposed significant economic pressure on the global pig industry. Given the potential for recombination among PRRSV genomes and variations in pathogenicity, newly emerging PRRSV isolates are of considerable clinical importance. In this study, we successfully isolated a novel strain named XJ-Z5 from PRRSV-positive samples collected in Xinjiang province in 2022. Through comprehensive genomic sequencing, phylogenetic analysis, and recombination analysis, we confirmed that this strain belongs to the NADC30-like recombinant PRRSV. During pathogenicity tests in piglets, this strain exhibited moderate virulence, causing symptoms such as reduced appetite, persistent fever, and weight loss; however, no mortality cases were observed. Tests conducted at various time points detected the presence of PRRSV nucleic acid in nasal swabs, rectal swabs, tissue samples, and blood, with the highest viral loads found in lung tissue and blood. Serum biochemical tests indicated significant impairment of liver and kidney function. PRRSV antibodies began to appear gradually after 10 days post infection. Hematoxylin and eosin staining revealed substantial pathological changes in lung tissue and lymph nodes. This study enhances our understanding of the epidemiology of PRRSV and underscores the importance of ongoing monitoring and research in light of the challenges posed by the continuous evolution of viral strains. Furthermore, the research emphasizes the urgency of the rapid genomic analysis of emerging viral strains. Through these comprehensive research and monitoring strategies, we aimed to curb the spread of PRRSV more effectively and thus reduce the huge economic losses it caused to the pig industry.",,,
