40390052,Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on continuity of medical treatment for patients with chronic diseases in Japan: a retrospective cohort analysis.,,BMC health services research,10.1186/s12913-025-12798-3,"The COVID-19 pandemic has raised concerns about continuity of care for chronic diseases such as diabetes, hypertension, and dyslipidemia. Although studies have documented declines in healthcare utilization, few have assessed individual-level patterns of treatment interruption. We conducted a retrospective cohort analysis using administrative claims data (2018-2021) from a Prefecture, Japan. Eligible patients were diagnosed with and prescribed medications for diabetes mellitus, hypertension, or dyslipidemia in January of 2019 or 2020 and followed until December of each year. The primary outcome was the time-to- interruption of physician visits, defined as a gap of at least 60 days between follow-up visits. We used Cox proportional hazards regression, adjusted for age, sex, comorbidities, and prior healthcare utilization, to compare the risk of treatment interruption in 2020 (COVID-19 group) vs. 2019 (pre-pandemic group). Sensitivity analyses were performed with thresholds of 30 and 90 days. Logistic regression examined whether pandemic-related interruptions were associated with the likelihood of returning to treatment within one year. A total of 410,911 patients met the inclusion criteria. Across all three chronic conditions, the hazard of interruption was significantly higher in 2020 than in 2019; adjusted HRs are 1.26 (95% CI = 1.17-1.36) for diabetes, 1.39 (95%CI = 1.31-1.47) for hypertension, and 1.24 (95%CI = 1.17-1.32) for dyslipidemia, respectively. No significant difference in resuming care was observed between the 2020 and 2019 interruptions (OR = 0.89; 95% CI = 0.81-1.09). Sensitivity analyses showed consistent findings, despite slight variations in hazard ratios for different gap thresholds. The COVID-19 pandemic was associated with an increased risk of treatment interruption in patients with chronic diseases, underscoring the need for targeted strategies to maintain care continuity during public health emergencies. While older patients and those with multimorbidity showed earlier interruptions, the overall patterns persisted across disease groups, emphasizing the importance of preemptive measures and patient outreach to prevent delayed or forgone care.",,,tomoki.ishikawa@ihep.jp.
40389817,Clinical utility of dynamic chest radiography as an auxiliary tool for atrial fibrillation detection in heart failure: a pilot study.,,BMC cardiovascular disorders,10.1186/s12872-025-04820-7,"Dynamic chest radiography (DCR) can estimate haemodynamic parameters in patients with heart failure (HF). Atrial fibrillation (AF) often coexists with HF; however, owing to its sometimes paroxysmal nature and minimal or absent symptoms, many patients with AF remain undiagnosed. Additional tools for AF diagnosis may be beneficial; therefore, we evaluated the ability of DCR to distinguish patients with HF in sinus rhythm (SR) from those with AF. In this small-sample pilot study, 20 patients with HF (median age, 67 years; males, 85%) underwent 12-lead electrocardiography and DCR on the same day. Aortic arch (Ao), right atrial (RA), right and left pulmonary artery (PA), and left ventricular (LV) apex pixel values (PVs) were measured. Seventeen patients were in SR and three demonstrated AF on 12-lead electrocardiography before DCR. The PV and PV change rate waveforms of the Ao, RA, PAs, and LV apex were regular in SR and irregular with AF. The difference between patients in SR and those with AF was particularly clear in the LV apex PV change rate waveforms. In addition, the heart rates (HRs) of patients in SR and with AF could be calculated from the PV change rate waveforms and were similar to those calculated by 12-lead electrocardiography. DCR can detect AF in patients with HF and may be able to infer HR.",,,hiraiwa.hiroaki.v0@f.mail.nagoya-u.ac.jp.

40389316,Modelling diabetes and depression in Pakistan: using economic modelling to inform intervention design and a clinical trial of a behavioural activation intervention.,2025-05-19,BMJ open,10.1136/bmjopen-2024-092158,"The 'Developing and evaluating an adapted behavioural activation intervention for depression and diabetes in South Asia (DiaDeM)' trial investigates a psychological intervention, behavioural activation (BA), on people with both diabetes and depression in Bangladesh and Pakistan. This study aimed to aid the intervention and trial design. This was a modelling study using microsimulation to assess the intervention's cost-effectiveness. Diabetes was modelled using the UK Prospective Diabetes Study model based on Pakistani patients and depression was modelled using Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) trajectories allowing for multiple depressive episodes. It was assumed that diabetes-related adverse events increased depression recurrence, while depression impacted haemoglobin A1c, increasing diabetes-related events. The model estimated (1) maximum cost of BA which would be cost-effective (headroom analysis) to inform intervention design, and (2) value of reducing uncertainty around different measures (value of information analysis) to prioritise data collection in the DiaDeM study. Analysis was conducted from a Pakistani healthcare perspective over a lifetime with costs and outcomes discounted at 3%. BA plus usual care was compared against usual care. BA involved six sessions by a trained (non-mental health) facilitator. The usual care comparator was the prevailing mix of pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatments used in Pakistan. The primary outcome was disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs). Secondary outcomes included life years, healthcare costs and the rate of depression and diabetes-related events. Over their lifetime, individuals receiving BA plus usual care avoid 3.2 (95% credible interval: 2.7 to 3.8) years of mild depression and experience fewer diabetes-related events. BA plus usual care resulted in an additional 0.27 (0.03 to 0.52) life years, 0.98 (0.45 to 1.86) DALYs averted and had incremental healthcare costs of -US$97 (-US$517 to US$142), excluding BA costs. The maximum cost per BA course at which was cost-effective is US$83 (US$9 to US$214). Value of information analysis found the most important measures to include in the trial are the impact of depression on diabetes and PHQ-9 over time. This is the first model to jointly model depression and diabetes for South Asia and uses novel methods to reflect the diseases and inform intervention and trial design. This evidence has helped to inform the design of the DiaDeM intervention and the trial to evaluate it.

40389291,The Role of Microbiologists in Drug Product Development.,,PDA journal of pharmaceutical science and technology,10.5731/pdajpst.2025-000010.1,"The role of the microbiologist during product development of medicines ensures patient safety during clinical trials and also the continuation of microbial control through commercialization of the new product. Microbiological expertise, insight, and cGMP input for new product development is needed for formulation, manufacturing, packaging and monitoring, plus testing of in-process materials, finished dosage form and stability. Risk assessment and evaluation of potential microbial contamination origin(s) support a phase-appropriate, broad end-to-end analytical approach to microbiological contamination control strategy. The ultimate beneficiary of this robust oversight and management of quality is the patient. Using knowledge and risk assessment along with experience (of non-sterile and sterile drug product development) provide for a balanced approach to microbiological quality in medicines.

40389107,Uptitration of sacubitril/valsartan in acute heart failure: Insight from the PREMIER study.,,Journal of cardiac failure,10.1016/j.cardfail.2025.05.001,"This study investigated the effect of uptitration in sacubitril/valsartan (Sac/Val) compared with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers (ACEI/ARB) on N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) level within current guideline-directed medical therapy in acute heart failure (AHF). This was the secondary analysis in the Program Angiotensin-Neprilysin Inhibition in Admitted Patients with Worsening Heart Failure (PREMIER) study. AHF patients were allocated to switch to Sac/Val or ACEI/ARB, and Sac/Val group was divided into Sac/Val with or without uptitration group (Sac/Val >24/26 mg or ≤24/26 mg twice daily at week 8). The primary endpoint was the proportional change in geometric means of NT-proBNP levels at week 8. A total of 376 patients were included, consistent with the primary analysis in PREMIER. The percent changes in NT-pro BNP level were -51% (Sac/Val with uptitration), -39% (Sac/Val without uptitration), and -32% (ACEI/ARB), and their group ratio adjusted for baseline characteristics were 0.72 (Sac/Val with uptitration vs. ACEI/ARB, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.59 to 0.89; p=0.002) and 0.93 (Sac/Val without uptitration vs. ACEI/ARB, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.13; p=0.47). However, Sac/Val without uptitration group yielded a greater NT-proBNP reduction than ACEI/ARB group (adjusted ratio of change 0.72, 95% CI 0.55 to 0.94; p=0.016) in the subgroup of reduced ejection fraction. There were no adverse events associated with Sac/Val uptitration. Uptitration of Sac/Val therapy yielded a greater NT-proBNP level reduction in AHF patients, but Sac/Val therapy without uptitration also reduced NT-proBNP level in a subgroup with reduced ejection fraction compared with ACEI/ARB therapy.",,,tanakaa2@cc.saga-u.ac.jp.
40388741,Emergency visits for end-of-life patients receiving physician-led home care in Japan: A retrospective observational study.,2025-05-19,Medicine,10.1097/MD.0000000000042501,"To clarify the patterns, reasons, and patient characteristics associated with emergency visits in the final 30 days of life for patients receiving home care in Japan. We conducted a retrospective analysis of emergency visits made by home care physicians to patients who died while receiving home care in 2018. Data on patient characteristics and emergency visits during the final 30 days of life were extracted from medical records. Poisson regression analysis was used to identify factors associated with emergency visit frequency. Among 83 end-of-life patients (median age 84 years, 49.4% male), a total of 86 emergency visits were recorded. These visits occurred most frequently in the days immediately preceding death, with 40.7% occurring within 5 days before death. Visits were more common during afternoons (37.2%) and weekends (39.6%). The primary reasons for visits included respiratory distress (20.9%), clinical assessment (14.0%), and neurological symptoms (12.8%). While some visits resulted in medication prescriptions (26.7%) or laboratory tests (22.1%), 36.1% involved observation only. Multivariable analysis revealed that longer duration of home care was associated with increased emergency visit frequency (31-365 days: relative risk [RR] 2.30, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.16-4.54; >365 days: RR 3.00, 95% CI: 1.56-5.78), while younger age was associated with increased visits (≤79 years: RR 2.04, 95% CI: 1.19-3.47). Emergency home visits in the terminal phase often clustered near death and frequently resulted in observation only, suggesting that some visits may be driven more by caregiver anxiety than medical urgency. Additionally, care level appeared to play a limited role during this period. These findings highlight the need for proactive symptom management, caregiver support, and scalable approaches such as telehealth to optimize end-of-life care.",Kosaka M; Miyatake H; Arita S; Tsunetoshi C; Masunaga H; Ozaki A; Beniya H,Orange Home-Care Clinic,
40388703,Amylin and the amylin receptors in migraine: Is there another pathway to target?,2025-05-19,Cephalalgia : an international journal of headache,10.1177/03331024251340066,"Here, we review the available evidence implicating amylin in migraine, its relationship with calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) and its potential utility as a therapeutic target. The pathophysiology of migraine is currently better understood and the role of CGRP is key. Treatments targeting this pathway have been successful and migraine is a complex disorder, with so many molecules being implicated. Amylin, as for CGRP, is part of the calcitonin/CGRP peptide family. Some therapies intended to block the CGRP pathway can also target amylin receptors. Similar to CGRP, amylin can trigger migraine attacks in a provocation study. Amylin plasma levels have been highlighted as a potential migraine biomarker in one study in migraine patients. Moreover, some preclinical studies in rodents have also discussed sex differences. Comprehending the distinct and overlapping mechanisms between amylin and CGRP signalling could develop further our understanding of migraine pathophysiology. In summary, this review reveals, through initial studies, that targeting the amylin pathway may have a potential role as a novel treatment option for those who may not respond to other treatments, or as a better alternative.",,,
40388610,Framework to identify innovative sources of value creation from platform technologies.,2025-05-19,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,10.1073/pnas.2424665122,"Platform technologies are fundamentally reshaping the pharmaceutical industry, offering unprecedented potential for innovation across multiple therapeutic areas. However, traditional valuation models, focused on single-asset metrics, struggle to capture the full spectrum of value these technologies create. This paper presents a comprehensive framework for evaluating the innovative sources of value creation enabled by platform technologies throughout the drug development lifecycle. Through a systematic literature review, in-depth case studies, and framework development, we provide a structured methodology for capturing the diverse benefits of these technologies. Our findings reveal that platform technologies generate value across strategic, technical, and adaptive dimensions, requiring a multifaceted valuation approach. The proposed Platform Value Identification across Strategic, Technical, and Adaptive domains Framework defines key value drivers, specifies quantitative assessment metrics, and provides implementation guidance to inform strategic decision-making in research and development investment, portfolio management, and business development. Application of the framework to case studies of Alnylam's RNAi platform, Genentech's therapeutic antibody platform, and Moderna's mRNA platform demonstrates its broad utility and impact potential. By adopting this holistic, data-driven approach, stakeholders can better assess the long-term value and competitive advantages of well-implemented platform technologies, accelerating the development of transformative therapies for patients.",Jones CH; Beitelshees M; Hill A; Griffiths D; Murphy M; Kapadia K; Dolsten M; True JM,Clearview Healthcare Partners; Pfizer; Bulmore Consulting,
40388415,R&D investment and total factor productivity in China's pharmaceutical industry: The moderating effect of the centralized procurement policy.,2025-05-19,PloS one,10.1371/journal.pone.0324519,"We use the implementation of China's centralized procurement policy as a quasi-natural experiment to examine the effects of China's centralized procurement policy on pharmaceutical research and development (R&D) investment and total factor productivity (TFP). Empirical findings demonstrate that the positive impact of R&D investment on TFP has a delayed effect in the pharmaceutical sector. The centralized procurement policy shortens this lagged effect by imposing survival pressure and pushing companies to enhance their R&D investment intensity significantly. From the heterogeneity perspective, for companies facing significant financing constraints, the centralized procurement policy significantly enhances the intensity of R&D investment. In contrast, for companies with weaker finance limitations, the impact of the policy on their R&D investment intensity is insignificant. Still, the positive moderating effect of the policy on the relationship between R&D investment and TFP is more pronounced. Based on the findings, policymakers need to take a long-term view and consider the diversified influence of different enterprises. Policies that reduce financing constraints and create an enabling environment for sustained R&D are important and complementary.",,,
40388089,"Conjunctivitis in Adults with Atopic Dermatitis Treated with Dupilumab: An Observational Study of Clinical Characteristics, Symptomatology, and Treatment.",,Advances in therapy,10.1007/s12325-025-03209-4,"Conjunctivitis is more prevalent in patients with atopic dermatitis (AD) than the general population, and is the most common adverse event during dupilumab treatment for AD. We aimed to characterize conjunctivitis diagnosed during AD dupilumab treatment and to assess effectiveness of ophthalmic treatments. This prospective observational study enrolled adults with AD who received the approved dupilumab regimen in a real-world setting for at least 8 weeks prior to enrollment. At baseline, we compared ophthalmic signs and symptoms in two cohorts of patients who had received dupilumab for similar duration: one with conjunctivitis (group 1) and one with no conjunctivitis (group 2). All patients continued treatment with dupilumab, and group 1 patients received treatment for conjunctivitis at the discretion of the investigator. We assessed effectiveness of prescribed treatments and the outcomes of conjunctivitis up to Week 60. All analyses were descriptive. A total of 35 patients were assessed in group 1 and 11 in group 2. Mean AD duration was 22.9 ± 15.2 years (group 1) and 13.1 ± 16.9 years (group 2). In group 1, 91% of patients reported a history of facial lesions during AD flares and 54% had current AD facial lesions, compared with 64% and 9%, respectively, in group 2. Ongoing facial contact dermatitis and rosacea were only reported in group 1 (11% and 9%, respectively). Common physical findings at baseline in group 1 compared with group 2 included periocular eczematous rash (65% vs. 18%) and/or lichenification (47% vs. 27%), posterior blepharitis with meibomian gland dysfunction (83% vs. 55%), bulbar hyperemia (89% vs. 46%) and conjunctival papillary pattern (69% vs. 27%); 24% of patients in group 1 and none in group 2 had corneal neovascularization, mostly in a single peripheral quadrant. There was no evidence of tear volume insufficiency. One patient in group 1 (3%) and two in group 2 (18%) had eyelash mites. Three patients (9%) in group 1 and one in group 2 (9%) had Staphylococcus aureus-positive conjunctival swabs. Most patients (88%) received multiple ophthalmic treatments for the qualifying conjunctivitis event. Investigators assessed topical corticosteroids and topical calcineurin inhibitors administered either as eye drops or ointment as the most effective treatments. Most conjunctivitis events recovered/resolved (84%) or were resolving/recovering (12%) at study end. Mean ± SD time to recovery from the initial visit was 171.9 ± 54.6 days. No participants discontinued treatment with dupilumab. Prolonged history of AD and facial and/or eyelid AD lesions increased the likelihood of a conjunctivitis diagnosis during AD dupilumab treatment. Treatment of conjunctivitis with topical corticosteroids and/or calcineurin inhibitors resolved or controlled the event in most patients without need to discontinue dupilumab. GOV: ClinicalTrial.gov Identifier: NCT04287608. Atopic dermatitis (AD) or eczema is an inflammatory disease with episodes of itchy skin rashes. Moderate-to-severe AD is not well controlled with common skin medications. Dupilumab is an advanced treatment approved for moderate-to-severe AD. Patients with AD are more likely to develop conjunctivitis (pink eye) than healthy people. Also, a conjunctivitis diagnosis is more likely during AD dupilumab treatment. We aimed to describe conjunctivitis in dupilumab-treated AD and summarize treatments prescribed by eye doctors, and their outcomes. We enrolled 35 patients with conjunctivitis affecting both eyes that developed while on dupilumab treatment (group 1). For comparison, we enrolled 11 patients without conjunctivitis while being treated with dupilumab for a similar duration (group 2). We found that group 1 patients had AD for longer and had AD rashes on the face and around eyes more often than group 2 patients. Eye examination showed inflammation of different eye parts in both groups, but more often in group 1 patients. There was no evidence for a unique type of dupilumab-related conjunctivitis. Conjunctivitis events were treated with combinations of common eye medications. Most conjunctivitis events recovered/resolved (84%) or were resolving/recovering (12%) at study end. In conclusion, a long history of AD and localization of AD to the face increased the likelihood of a conjunctivitis diagnosis during AD dupilumab treatment. Treatment with common anti-inflammatory eye drops or ointments was successful in most patients without needing to discontinue dupilumab. These results may help dermatologists recognize and manage conjunctivitis during dupilumab treatment for AD.",Akpek E; Chen Z; Lawless E; Van Spall M; Ozturk ZE; Shumel B,Johns Hopkins Medicine; Regeneron Ireland DAC; Sanofi; Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc.,brad.shumel@regeneron.com.
40388087,Macitentan and Tadalafil Combination Therapy in Patients with Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension and Cardiovascular Comorbidities: Real-World Evidence from OPUS and OrPHeUS.,,Advances in therapy,10.1007/s12325-025-03180-0,"Patients diagnosed with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) often present with risk factors associated with cardiovascular disease, including diabetes mellitus (DM), hypertension (HTN), and obesity. The 2022 ESC/ERS pulmonary hypertension treatment guidelines recommend initial monotherapy with an endothelin receptor antagonist (ERA) or phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitor (PDE5i) for patients with PAH and cardiopulmonary comorbidities, with treatment escalation to be considered on an individual basis. Data on safety, tolerability, and effectiveness of combination therapy in these patients are lacking. OPUS (prospective, observational drug registry) and OrPHeUS (retrospective, medical chart review) were multicenter US studies of patients newly initiating the ERA macitentan (2013-2020). Patients in the combined OPUS/OrPHeUS dataset with PAH receiving combination therapy with macitentan and the PDE5i tadalafil were identified. Descriptive analyses were performed for patients with ≥ 1 of DM/HTN/obesity and those without these comorbidities. In OPUS/OrPHeUS, 1336 patients with PAH received macitentan plus tadalafil during the observation period. Of these, 820 (61.4%) had ≥ 1 of DM/HTN/obesity and 516 (38.6%) had none of these comorbidities at or before enrollment. Median (Q1, Q3) exposure to macitentan and tadalafil combination therapy was similar at 13.7 (3.5, 28.0) and 14.8 (5.4, 27.4) months, respectively. For patients with ≥ 1 of DM/HTN/obesity versus those without, 1-year Kaplan-Meier estimates (95% confidence limits) for survival were 92.3% (89.9, 94.1) and 91.9% (88.8, 94.1), for patients free from hospitalization were 63.6% (59.6, 67.2) and 60.0% (55.1, 64.5), and for patients persisting on combination therapy were 66.5% (63.1, 69.8) and 68.5% (64.1, 72.4). Adverse events (AE; OPUS only) were reported in 78.4% and 80.0%, respectively, with no unexpected AEs observed. There was a trend towards higher AE incidence with increasing comorbidity number and in patients with cardiovascular comorbidities who were treatment-naïve. Patients with PAH and ≥ 1 of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, or obesity treated with macitentan and tadalafil combination therapy had similar hospitalization, survival, and safety profiles as those without these comorbidities, though patients with comorbidities initiated on combination therapy and those with multiple comorbidities may require closer monitoring. These real-world data suggest that combination therapy may be considered for patients with PAH and cardiovascular comorbidities. OPsumit gov/. Patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) often have other conditions affecting their heart or blood vessels, known as cardiovascular comorbidities. It is recommended that patients with PAH and cardiovascular comorbidities start with one PAH medication and later add another, if possible. However, there is limited information on the safety and effectiveness of combining two PAH medications in these patients. The OPUS and OrPHeUS studies collected information on patients with PAH treated in United States clinics between 2013 and 2020. We identified patients who were treated with two PAH medications, macitentan and tadalafil (referred to as combination therapy). We grouped them into patients with cardiovascular comorbidities (any medical history of diabetes mellitus, hypertension or obesity; 820 patients) and patients without these conditions (516 patients) and looked at how they did over time. Both groups were treated with combination therapy for approximately 14–15 months. After 1 year, outcomes were similar for patients with and without cardiovascular comorbidities: survival for both groups was 92%; 64% and 60% of patients remained hospitalization-free; and 67% and 69% remained on combination therapy. Side effects were consistent with those expected for these medications, with generally more side effects seen in patients with more comorbidities and in those new to PAH medications. Patients with PAH and cardiovascular comorbidities treated with macitentan and tadalafil combination therapy had similar results as those without cardiovascular comorbidities. This suggests that combination therapy may be used in select patients with PAH and cardiovascular comorbidities, although those who have more comorbidities or are new to PAH treatment may need closer observation.",Ong R; MacDonald G; Martin N; Senatore A,Statistical Decision Science; Global Epidemiology; Global Medical Affairs,Kimh33kim@health.ucsd.edu.

Information regarding treatment status for GPP and treatment patterns for flares is important but limited as a result of the rarity of the condition. We conducted a 10-year, retrospective, longitudinal chart review of treatment patterns at GPP referral hospitals in Japan. Eligible patients with GPP had at least 6 months of continuous observation data within 10 years after the date of protocol approval. Data were collected from patient records and annual patient reports. Patient characteristics and treatment details, including in relation to flare occurrence, were analyzed. The median age of patients (N = 205) was 53 years; 48.3% were female and most had mild or moderate GPP (66.8%). Patients commonly received nonbiologic systemic therapy (86.3%) and a similar proportion received biologics (79.5%); 95.1% received topical treatment and 22.4% received systemic adrenal corticosteroids. Use of nonbiologic systemic therapy decreased, and use of biologics increased, over the study period. During the observation period, the proportion of patients receiving biologic therapy increased after a flare (from 41.4% receiving biologics when flares occurred to 62.9% initiating a new biologic post flare). In Japanese clinical practice, the evolution of treatment practices for GPP has seen an increased use of biologic therapies over time. Biologic use was common after flares; however, some flares occurred during biologic therapy, indicating a need for improved treatment options to maintain stable disease and prevent flares.",Sakamoto W; Saitoh M; ,; Nippon Boehringer Ingelheim,yukari-o@tokyo-med.ac.jp.

Consequently, cancer support groups have a crucial role in guiding patients through their cancer journey and improving their quality of life. However, in Egypt, patient support groups remain undervalued and lack comprehensive visibility. This study aimed to address this gap by mapping patient online support groups in Egypt, categorizing them, and highlighting their importance in supporting patients and caregivers. The research includes examining online support groups and pages, particularly on Facebook. The results of our investigation indicate that 21% of the Facebook groups examined met the criteria for classification as qualified, another 21% were categorized as semi-qualified, while most of the groups, comprising 58%, were considered non-qualified. For the Facebook pages examined, organizational involvement through governmental, non-governmental, and charitable institutions qualified these pages as meeting the criteria for qualification. In contrast, the majority (70%) of the analyzed community pages were non-qualified, 30% were semi-qualified, and none met the criteria for qualification. This underscores the need for discernment when engaging with online resources. Furthermore, the study illuminates the role of various organizations, including hospitals, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and pharmaceutical companies, in supporting cancer patients, especially through online support groups. Despite these efforts, comprehensive review articles on Egyptian patient support groups are lacking, making this study a significant contribution to understanding and enhancing patient support in the fight against cancer.",Hassan Y,AstraZeneca,emad.shash@nci.cu.edu.eg.

Using a retrospective cohort of subjects with an MCI diagnosis at study entry and at least two follow-up visits between 2005 and December 2022, we developed a functional multistate model framework to estimate longitudinal patterns of transition probabilities between different cognitive states. The probability of reversion increased from 2% at baseline to a maximum of 8% by year 10 before gradual decline thereafter. For post-reversion, the probability of progression to MCI rose from 8% to 35.71% at Year 10 and subsequently stabilized. The instantaneous risk of MCI progressing was similar to the risk of re-progression to MCI for post-reversion. Post-reversion subjects remained at an increased risk of cognitive deterioration. The instantaneous risk of MCI progressing to AD is similar to the risk of re-progression to MCI for post-reversion. The FMSM we developed effectively utilizes multiple longitudinal markers to reveal variable transition patterns between different cognitive states. Considering both spatiotemporal dimensions and sparse irregularities from longitudinal neuroimaging and neuropsychological scales, fMLFPCA and MVFPCA help to extract variation patterns, to capture detailed changes characterizing the multidimensional evolution patterns of MCI.",,,

However, their effect on clinical outcomes has yet to be fully elucidated. In this study, we investigated the impact of irAEs, particularly pneumonitis, on clinical outcomes in patients receiving combined immunotherapy and chemotherapy for NSCLC. We retrospectively enrolled 850 patients with programmed cell death ligand-1 (PD-L1) 1-49% advanced NSCLC who were treated with chemotherapy alone or with combined immunotherapy and chemotherapy as first-line treatment at 19 different institutions in Japan between March 2017 and June 2022. Using data from their medical records, we examined the type and severity of irAEs and their association with clinical outcomes, including overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS). OS and PFS were not significantly different between patients with and without severe irAEs. However, in the group receiving combined immunotherapy and chemotherapy, those who developed pneumonitis within 42 days of treatment initiation had shorter OS and PFS, irrespective of the pneumonitis grade, and a worse prognosis than those who received chemotherapy alone. Additionally, early-onset pneumonitis was more likely in patients aged >75 years, those with high lactate dehydrogenase levels, and those receiving steroids or immunosuppressants, suggesting that these factors may contribute to the risk of early-onset pneumonitis. Early-onset pneumonitis is a poor prognostic factor in patients with PD-L1 1-49% advanced NSCLC receiving combined immunotherapy and chemotherapy. Further large-scale observational studies are warranted to confirm these findings. Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC); severe immune-related adverse events (irAEs); pneumonitis.",,,

Data of patients who underwent elective LAR for rectal cancer between 2018 and 2022 were obtained from the National Clinical Database of Japan. Hospitals were categorized into high-, medium-, and low-volume groups. Each group was constituted to represent approximately one-third of all surgeries performed between 2018 and 2019. The standardized morbidity/mortality ratios (SMRs) of Clavien-Dindo grade ≥3 (CD ≥ 3) complications were the primary endpoint. The secondary endpoints included anastomotic leakage, pneumonia, and surgical mortality. This study analyzed 91 800 cases of elective LAR, with 10.5% experiencing CD ≥ 3 complications, 8.8% anastomotic leakage, 0.9% pneumonia, and 0.5% surgical mortality. Despite COVID-19, SMRs of CD ≥ 3 complications decreased from 2018 to 2022 across all groups. However, increases in the rates and SMRs of CD ≥ 3 complications were observed in low-volume hospitals around mid-2020, followed by a decline. Anastomotic leakage showed similar trends. The rates and SMRs of pneumonia and surgical mortality remained unchanged. Notably, anastomotic leakage rates were 7.6%, 8.9%, and 10.0% in high-, medium-, and low-volume hospitals, respectively, indicating superior outcomes in high-volume hospitals. Early COVID-19 waves may have disproportionately affected low-volume hospitals. However, the decline in SMRs of CD ≥ 3 complications from 2018 to 2022 across all three groups suggests the robustness and resilience of surgical services for rectal cancer in Japan.

After searching CENTRAL, PubMed, and ICHUSHI-Web in July 2024, we included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing advanced dressings and standard dressings for surgical wounds in gastrointestinal surgery (PROSPERO No. CRD42024569084). Three authors independently screened the RCTs. We assessed the risk of bias and certainty of the body of evidence for the extracted data. The primary outcome was superficial SSI, and the secondary outcomes were length of postoperative hospital stay, costs, and allergy. This study was partially supported by the JSSI. A total of seven RCTs and 927 patients were included. The use of advanced dressings significantly lowered the risk of SSI compared to that associated with standard dressings (risk ratio: 0.54, 95% confidence intervals: 0.34-0.88). The certainty of the evidence was rated as moderate. According to the subgroup analysis, advanced dressings reduced the risk of SSI in colorectal surgery. Advanced dressings did not reduce the length of postoperative hospital stay or costs compared to that of standard dressings.

While systemic (pharmacological) therapy is currently established as the 'standard of care', effective local ulcer management remains crucial for all cases of DUs. This is particularly true for patients who cannot tolerate systemic treatments or in the case of refractory SSc-DUs. On this background, there is a pressing demand for the formulation of evidence-based guidelines to assist clinicians and patients in navigating the local treatment options for DUs. A steering committee of international experts was established by the World Scleorderma Foundation (WSF) Digital Ulcer (DU) ad hoc committee. Two systematic literature reviews on local non-surgical and surgical treatments for the management of SSc-DUs were performed to inform the development of local treatment recommendations for SSc-DUs. Consensus methodology was used to develop the final treatment recommendations. Six overarching treatment principles and eight local treatment recommendations (five non-surgical and three surgical) were agreed upon for the management of SSc-DU. Among topical non-surgical options, botulin toxin can be conditionally recommended for refractory and/or severe DUs. Among surgical treatments, autologous adipose tissue grafting might be recommended for DU healing when combined with background systemic treatments. These recommendations are specifically tailored to guide treatment decisions concerning both local and non-pharmacological approaches to managing SSc-related DUs.

The aim of the current study was to update this prior MAIC with more mature clinical data from both trials. The approach of the MAIC remained consistent with the previous study, with the exception of more mature data (28.4 months and 30.4 months of follow-up for elranatamab from MagnetisMM-3 (NCT04649359) and teclistamab from MajesTEC-1 (NCT03145181, NCT04557098), respectively). Individual patient-level data from MagnetisMM-3 (N = 116) were reweighted to match published aggregated data from MajesTEC-1. Variables included for adjustment were age (≥75 years), sex (for OS only), median time since diagnosis, International Staging System disease stage, high-risk cytogenetics, extramedullary disease, number of prior lines of therapy, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status, and penta-exposed/refractory status. An unanchored MAIC was conducted based on the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence Decision Support Unit 18 example code. A sensitivity analysis was conducted in which missing baseline characteristics data were imputed for elranatamab. In the base-case analysis, elranatamab was associated with significantly longer PFS (hazard ratio [HR] 0.55 [95% confidence intervals (CI): 0.37, 0.81], p < 0.05), OS (HR [95% CI]: 0.60 [0.40, 0.91], p < 0.05, and DoR 0.56 [0.31, 0.99] p < 0.05) compared with teclistamab. Results were largely consistent in the sensitivity analysis, except that the differences in OS were non-significant. A subgroup analysis of patients with a complete response or better was consistent with the base case.

CTs for the prevention/treatment of OM were identified using  Failed OM CTs were more likely to have academic sponsorship (45.7% vs. 39.1%), nonrandomized design (19.6% vs. 4.3%), and lower mean subject accrual (27.8 subjects vs. 101.4 subjects) compared to completed trials. The leading reason for termination was recruitment/enrollment (37.9%). Recruitment/enrollment and safety/efficacy accounted for failure in 84.6% of phase II trials. Contrary to general CTs where safety/efficacy concerns predominate, our results suggest OM-related trial failures are associated with a broader list of challenges including recruitment/enrollment, funding/sponsorship, and investigator/site issues. OM CTs demand aggressive planning, funding, and careful selection of trial sites and sponsorship to assure timely subject recruitment and reduce the risk for early termination and withdrawal.",,,

We present a post hoc analysis of Japanese participants. SOLAR is a randomized (2:1), open-label, multicenter, non-inferiority study of virologically suppressed participants switching to CAB+RPV LA Q2M (with or without oral lead-in) versus continuing BIC/FTC/TAF. The primary endpoint was HIV-1 RNA ≥50 copies/mL at Month 12 (Snapshot algorithm). Of 670 participants (modified intention-to-treat-exposed population), 20 were from Japan (LA, n=14; BIC/FTC/TAF, n=6).

Withdrawals were due to a non-drug-related adverse event (AE; acute hepatitis B) and a physician decision. Excluding injection site reactions, drug-related AE rates were higher in the LA group (36% vs 17%; all grade 1 or 2). No drug-related serious AEs were reported. Injection site reactions were common (100% [13/13] of LA participants); all were grade 1 or 2; none led to withdrawal; median duration was 4 days. Mean treatment satisfaction scores improved from baseline to Month 12 in the LA versus BIC/FTC/TAF Japanese groups (+6.25 vs +0.33 on a 66-point scale).

Since multiple organs may be involved in this disease, early treatment is required. In this regard, glucocorticoid (GC) therapy is often initiated before a definitive diagnosis is made. A biopsy of an injured organ is useful for a diagnosis but is not performed in all cases due to its invasiveness and, at times, diagnostic accuracy. Therefore, a comprehensive diagnosis is often made based on symptoms and clinical course of disease. However, it is sometimes difficult to distinguish EGPA from other hypereosinophilic diseases or vasculitides. In recent years, in addition to GC and immunosuppressive agents, anti-interleukin (IL)-5/IL-5 receptor alpha (IL-5Rα) antibodies targeting eosinophils have become increasingly important in the treatment of EGPA. However, accumulating data suggest that such anti-IL-5/IL-5Rα antibody therapy may have effects beyond those observed in eosinophils.

However, interindividual variability in clinical response to aripiprazole, possibly linked to its D2 partial agonism and D2 upregulation due to prior antipsychotics, has been reported. This study assessed whether there would be symptomatic aggravations or adverse events in clinically stable patients with schizophrenia when switching from oral antipsychotics to aripiprazole once-monthly (AOM), considering prior antipsychotics: oral aripiprazole (Group I) or other D2 antagonists (Group II). This was a 20-week, prospective, open-label, multicenter trial. Clinically stable patients with schizophrenia were assigned to two groups based on their oral antipsychotic medication and received AOM every 4 weeks. The primary endpoint was a change from baseline in the total Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) score. Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were monitored. Altogether, 100 patients in Group I and 101 in Group II completed the study.

Ganoderma lucidum is a common edible and medicinal mushroom, widely used as a functional food in Asia. This study investigated the potential anti-aging effects of Ganoderma lucidum extract (GLE). Our results demonstrated that GLE alleviated cellular oxidative stress, reduced the abnormal increase of mitochondrial ROS in aging cells, and maintained mitochondrial membrane integrity and inner membrane potential. Additionally, GLE affected mitochondrial biogenesis in aging cells. In a murine photoaging model, GLE treatment mitigated UVA-induced mitochondrial dysfunction while markedly attenuating UVA-triggered epidermal thickening and dermal protein depletion. These properties may be interrelated with the presence of abundant triterpenoids identified by LC-MS analysis.",,,zhysums@163.com.

Comprehensive data on tick abundance and the underlying ecological drivers are crucial for developing awareness and control strategies and to assess future changes in tick-borne disease risk. We aimed to provide a Germany-wide map of I. ricinus abundance to aid in disease transmission risk assessment. During 2018-2020, questing tick density was assessed at 83 sites across the whole country by drag flagging, whereby 49,344 I. ricinus nymphs and adults were collected. Relationships between climate, land cover, and monthly questing I. ricinus nymph density were explored and used to draw an abundance map. Highest tick hazard was observed in areas near the coast with mild winters and moist springs, and in mid-elevation mountain ranges, which represent popular tourist destinations. The ticks' seasonal activity pattern was predominantly unimodal. The fact that the observed regional differences are contradictory to a previous estimation based on a combination of regional studies illustrates the need for an extensive and coordinated sampling effort to reliably estimate tick abundance at larger spatial scales. Combined with data on tick-borne pathogens, our study enables estimating the density of infected ticks and consequently the risk of acquiring an infectious tick bite. Moreover, the observed relationships with climate and land cover can help to predict future developments of tick hazard under different climate scenarios in Central Europe.",Kämmer D; Bulling I; Kahl O,tick-radar GmbH,andrea.springer@tiho-hannover.de.

A longitudinal complete-case analysis of 714 children and adolescents (mean age: 11.2 years; 46.2% females) was conducted using data from the Brazilian High-Risk Cohort Study for Psychiatric Disorders in Childhood (BHRC). At baseline, parents/guardians completed the Family Environment Scale and the Brazilian SES Questionnaire. Three years after baseline, the same participants underwent brain magnetic resonance imaging, and the Child Behaviour Checklist (CBCL) was administered. Automated segmentation of the amygdala and hippocampus was performed using FreeSurfer v.5.1 software. Family conflict at baseline predicted internalising and externalising behaviours at follow-up. Evidence regarding the effects of family conflict and SES on brain structure and the moderating effects of family conflict on psychopathology and brain outcomes conditioned on SES was lacking. These results are consistent with emerging evidence that family conflict is a risk factor for externalising and internalising youth behaviour.

Societies worldwide felt the effects of the virus and pandemic related restrictive measures on their economies, healthcare systems, and social fabric. To curb the spread of COVID-19, numerous restrictive measures were implemented. This manuscript summarizes the findings published within the thematic series on Child Mental Health during the Covid-19 pandemic. Between May 2020 and June 2024 Child and Adolescent Psychiatry and Mental Health (CAPMH) issued a thematic series on ""Child Mental Health during the Covid-19 pandemic."" All manuscripts underwent a prescreening process by the Editor-in-Chief, including checks regarding the compliance with ethical standards compliance with the scope of the journal and the thematic series. Suitable manuscripts were then handled by one of the editors of the thematic series. All suitable manuscripts then underwent a peer review process that included at least two reviews. Different aspects of child and adolescent mental health as well as various aspects of the pandemic - in addition to their findings -were investigated, defined and discussed throughout the manuscripts within the series. A total of 327 manuscripts were submitted and 85 manuscripts were published within the series. Manuscripts included qualitative and quantitative studies as well as systematic reviews. The manuscripts reported findings from 22 countries from all over the world and various populations. The studies covered the somatic and psychological impacts of the pandemic, including emotional and behavioral consequences, non-suicidal self-injury and suicidal behavior, threat and trauma, parent child separation, school closure and home schooling, physical activity and media use, psychiatric care, as well as digital resources and online therapy. Through its findings, the research also highlighted the multilayered impact the pandemic had, as well as the need to make targeted interventions and evidence-based interventions available to a large audience. A broad range of literature in the series submitted from various countries around the world documented the profound impact of COVID-19 on child mental health. The findings can be used as a foundation for conceptualizing targeted programs to counteract the consequences, in addition to helping prepare systems in the event of similar incidents in the future.",,,Andreas.witt@upd.ch.
40379965,Psychiatric genome-wide association study enrichment shows promise for future psychopharmaceutical discoveries.,,Communications medicine,10.1038/s43856-025-00877-9,"Innovation in psychiatric therapeutics has stagnated on known mechanisms. Psychiatric genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified hundreds of genome-wide significant (GWS) loci that have rapidly advanced our understanding of disease etiology. However, whether these results can be leveraged to improve clinical treatment for specific psychiatric disorders remains poorly understood. In this proof-of-principal evaluation of GWAS clinical utility, we test whether the targets of drugs used to treat Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), Bipolar Disorder (BiP), Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD), Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), Schizophrenia (SCZ), Substance Use Disorders (SUDs), and insomnia (INS), are enriched for GWAS meta-analysis findings. The genes coding for treatment targets of medications used to SCZ, BiP, MDD, and SUDs (but not ADHD, PTSD, GAD, or INSOM) are enriched for GWS loci identified in their respective GWAS (ORs: 2.78-27.63; all ps <1.15e-3). Enrichment is largely driven by the presence of a GWS locus or loci within a gene coding for a drug target (i.e., proximity matching). Broadly, additional annotation (i.e., functional: Combined Annotation Dependent Depletion [CADD] scores, regulomeDB scores, eQTL, chromatin loop, and gene region; statistical: effect size of genome-wide significant SNPs; Z-score of SNPs; number of drug targets implicated by GWAS), with the exception of weighting by the largest SNP effect size, does not further improve enrichment across disorders. Evaluation of prior smaller GWAS reveal that more recent larger GWAS improve enrichment. GWAS results may assist in the prioritization of medications for future psychopharmaceutical research. To ensure the validity of genetic studies to discover new psychiatric treatments, we tested if large-scale genetic studies of psychiatric disorders could be used to rediscover existing psychiatric treatments. We found that by looking at results from genetic studies of schizophrenia, major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, and substance use disorders we were able to rediscover existing treatments. The best indicator of the genes that would predict potential new medications was the degree to which the genetic change was associated with the original disease. Our findings should enable improved discovery of possible targets for psychiatric treatments.",Huggett SB,Synapze LLC,ashatoum@wustl.edu.

This review traces the development of nonclinical QT evaluation, highlighting key milestones and innovations that have shaped current practices in cardiac safety assessment. The emergence of regulatory guidelines, including International Council for Harmonization of Technical Requirements for Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH) S7B, established a nonclinical framework for evaluating drug effects on cardiac repolarization, addressing concerns raised by drug withdrawals in the 1990s. Advances in in vitro, in vivo, and in silico models have enhanced the predictive accuracy of nonclinical studies, with the hERG assay and telemetry-based animal models becoming gold standards. Recent initiatives, such as the Comprehensive in vitro Proarrhythmia Assay (CiPA) and the Japan iPS Cardiac Safety Assessment (JiCSA), emphasize integrating mechanistic insights from human-derived cardiomyocyte models and computational approaches to refine risk predictions. The 2020s mark a shift toward integrated nonclinical-clinical risk assessments, as exemplified by the ICH E14/S7B Questions and Answers. These highlight the need of best practices for study design, data analysis, and interpretation to support regulatory decision-making. Furthermore, the adoption of New Approach Methodologies (NAMs) and reinforced adherence to 3Rs principles (Reduce, Refine, Replace) reflect a commitment to ethical and innovative safety science. This review underscores the importance of harmonized and translational approaches in cardiac safety evaluation, providing a foundation for advancing drug development while safeguarding patient safety. Future directions include further integration of advanced methodologies and regulatory harmonization to streamline nonclinical and clinical risk assessments.",Delpy E; Bétat AM; Delaunois A; Drieu la Rochelle C; Martel E; Valentin JP,Department of Drug Discovery Sciences-General Pharmacology; Non-Clinical Department; Early Clinical Development & Translational Science,eric.delpy@biotrial.com.

Evaluate factors associated with response to filgotinib over time. Patients from SELECTION (NCT02914522) receiving filgotinib 200 mg (FIL200) or 100 mg (FIL100), or placebo were included. Factors associated with partial Mayo Clinic Score (pMCS) were assessed post hoc using a mixed model for repeated measures (MMRM). The prognostic value of week 10 faecal calprotectin (FCP) was assessed versus week 58 outcomes; p values are nominal. The MMRM included 558 patients (FIL200, n = 199; FIL100, n = 172; placebo, n = 187). For filgotinib, factors associated with lower week 58 pMCS versus respective comparators (p < 0.05) included being biologic-naive, low baseline inflammatory burden (endoscopic subscore <3, C-reactive protein ≤3 mg/L), or week 10 histological remission, endoscopic subscore ≤1, rectal bleeding and stool frequency subscores of 0, Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire scores >170, and/or lower FCP concentration. The optimal prognostic week 10 FCP cut-off for a concurrent week 10 Mayo Clinic Score response was <250 µg/g; combined week 10 FCP <250 µg/g and pMCS remission had similar week 58 prognostic value for clinical remission as week 10 endoscopic response. Being biologic-naive, having low baseline inflammatory burden, or strong week 10 filgotinib responses were associated with lower pMCS over 1 year of treatment. FCP <250 µg/g and week 10 pMCS remission may reduce the need for follow-up endoscopy.",Jamoul C; Muller K; Taliadouros V; Oortwijn A,Galapagos NV; Medical Affairs; Biostatistics,edouard.louis@uliege.be.

This study evaluated the effectiveness of school-based interventions in preventing and reducing tobacco use among adolescents in LMICs. Seven databases were searched until 20 March 2024. The primary outcome was tobacco use prevalence (ever or point prevalence) at the longest follow-up. Risk of bias (RoB) was assessed, and random-effects meta-analyses were conducted, exploring heterogeneity via meta-regression (PROSPERO registration CRD42022330329). Twenty-seven studies (n=57,292) were summarised descriptively, and 20 were meta-analysed. Most studies were from Brazil (n=5, 18.5%), India (n=5, 18.5%), China (n=3, 11.1%), and Pakistan (n=2, 7.4%); twelve (44.4%) assessed newly developed and fifteen (55.6%) culturally adapted existing interventions; and over half (n=14, 51.9%) focused solely on preventing and reducing tobacco use while the rest addressed multiple behaviours. Overall, interventions reduced adolescent tobacco use (odds ratio [OR] 0.76, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.64-0.91; I²=47%; n=20; 50,056 participants). Stratification by outcome measure showed significant reductions in point prevalence (OR 0.69, 95% CI: 0.57-0.85; I²=32.4%). After adjusting for study duration, interventions with higher contact time had lower effectiveness than shorter interventions (adjusted OR 1.36, 95% CI: 1.01-1.84; p=0.045; I²=22%). Low RoB studies demonstrated lower odds of tobacco use among participants (OR 0.66, 95% CI: 0.50-0.87; I²=14%; n=6). School-based interventions in LMICs effectively reduce the proportion of adolescents who use tobacco. Shorter interventions appeared to be effective, suggesting that brief yet engaging interventions may offer practical advantages and could contribute to addressing the tobacco epidemic in LMICs. Further research is needed to determine optimal intervention duration and intensity for sustained effectiveness.",,,sahadat.hossain.21@ucl.ac.uk.

40377441,Response to a novel type II RAF inhibitor in diffuse leptomeningeal glioneuronal tumor with BRAF fusion.,2025-05-16,The oncologist,10.1093/oncolo/oyaf093,"Diffuse leptomeningeal glioneuronal tumor (DL-GNT) is a rare disease which is more often diagnosed in children and adolescents than adults. Activation of the MAPK/ERK pathway is implicated in the majority of cases, and BRAF fusions are the most common genetic alteration. BRAF fusions result in dimerization and constitutive downstream MAPK/ERK activity, against which type I RAF inhibitors have limited efficacy. Type II RAF inhibitors stabilize RAF in an inactive conformation and inhibit both dimer protomers, thus inhibiting downstream MAPK/ERK activity in the setting of BRAF fusions. A previously-healthy 33 year old man was diagnosed with DL-GNT, which harbored a pathogenic BRAF:KIAA1549 gene fusion. He was initially treated with a MEK inhibitor but developed drug-related cardiotoxicity. Without treatment, he developed significant functional limitations due to leptomeningeal disease. A compassionate use indication was pursued for an investigational CNS-penetrant type II BRAF inhibitor, tovorafenib. Within 3 months of initiating the medication, the patient experienced notable gains in functional status and with over 12 months of treatment has been able to rejoin recreational activities. This case highlights the importance of tumor molecular characterization, particularly in rare tumors, whereby identification of the BRAF:KIAA1594 gene fusion led to an appropriate selection of a type II BRAF inhibitor.",,,

Despite the distressing nature of this symptom, clinicians frequently underestimate its prevalence and it is under-reported by patients who may be unaware of the availability of effective treatment options. The identification and management of CKD-associated pruritus should form an essential aspect of patient-centred care; however, patients with CKD may have multiple causes of chronic itch including those of dermatological, systemic, neuropathic and psychogenic origin, and CKD-associated pruritus must be distinguished from these. Together with its highly variable presentation in patients on haemodialysis, the range of potential causes of itch makes differential diagnosis of CKD-associated pruritus challenging. The presence of bilaterally symmetrical and non-dermatomally distributed itching, commonly affecting the back, limbs, chest and head is characteristic of CKD-associated pruritus, although approximately 50% of patients report generalized pruritus. Secondary skin lesions (including excoriation, crusts, impetigo, lichenifications and prurigo also seen in dermatological conditions) may or may not be observed, and xerosis (dry skin) that may exacerbate itching is common. Here, we provide a pragmatic approach to the identification and differential diagnosis of chronic itching in CKD-associated pruritus with the aim of supporting the effective management of this highly distressing symptom in clinical practice.",Lanot A; Aucella F,Normandie Université; Department of Nephrology and Dialysis,

Strategies to improve the healthcare landscape for RDs in SA have also been recommended. A 1-day workshop, conducted at the Saudi Health Council in Riyadh, SA on 5 June 2023, gathered stakeholders from the government, private sector, pharmaceutical industry, legislators, regulators, providers, payers, academia, and insurance companies. Through a series of presentations, educational sessions, and plenary discussions, participants examined the current landscape of RDs in SA, identified barriers to accessing ODs, and recommended strategies and initiatives to improve the accessibility, innovation, and sustainability of ODs. The workshop highlighted key challenges recognized by a diverse group of 59 participants, including the absence of a national strategy, absent of local RDs and ODs definitions in the Saudi context, limited awareness and understanding of RDs among healthcare professionals, delayed diagnoses, scarcity of treatment and diagnosis centers for RDs, insufficient screening and prevention programs, regulatory hurdles in approving and importing ODs, and financial constraints. These challenges significantly impact patient access to ODs, imposing additional burdens on patients, families, healthcare systems, and society. The recommended strategies to enhance RD and OD accessibility include multifaceted approaches, such as increasing medical education and awareness, accrediting and investing in expanding the number of centers of excellence for RD diagnosis and management, streamlining regulatory processes for OD approval and importation, fostering international collaborations for knowledge exchange and capacity building, and implementing national policies to improve the affordability and reimbursement of ODs. Stakeholder collaboration is crucial to overcome the accessibility challenges of RDs and ODs. The development of comprehensive national RD strategies ensures equitable resource allocation, a national RD registry, and infrastructure improvements. These measures are vital for ensuring equitable access to ODs and the efficient provision of healthcare services in SA.",Alrabiah A; AlMuaither A,C enter for Health Technology Assessment; General Directorate of National Health Policies and Economics,
40376143,How do we put meaning into meaningful benefit? Perspectives from the lived experience.,,"Alzheimer's & dementia (New York, N. Y.)",10.1002/trc2.70095,"Meaningful benefit is a much-debated concept in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Research to date has primarily focused on change thresholds that are anchored in clinicians' or care partners' impressions; however, these thresholds are not inherently meaningful to people living with AD (PLWAD) and may not take their perspectives into account. By overlaying the lived experience of AD through the eyes of individual PLWAD and their care partners with clinical outcomes, we offer an important framework in which to consider meaningful benefit in terms of symptoms, functioning, and outcomes. The PLWAD and care partner interviews and surveys of the What Matters Most (WMM) research program have identified treatment-related needs, preferences, and priorities of people at risk of or living with AD and their care partners across the AD continuum. A WMM conceptual model of disease-created and refined through interviews with PLWAD and care partners across the AD severity spectrum-includes 50 concepts across six domains (social life/activities, thought processing, communication, daily activities, mood/emotion, and general independence) considered important to all PLWAD and care partners. From the PLWAD and care partner perspectives, an increase in time to the onset, development, or worsening of the symptoms in any of these meaningful concepts was considered a meaningful benefit. No single commonly used clinical outcome assessment captures all concepts of importance, nor the importance of time in AD; considering the lived experience and priorities of individuals affected by AD is crucial to put the ""meaning"" in ""meaningful.""",Paulsen R; Romano CD; Frangiosa T; Mordin M; Dardis GJ; DiBenedetti D; Petersen RC,Faegre Drinker Consulting Washington District of Columbia USA.; RTI Health Solutions Durham North Carolina USA.; Department of Neurology Mayo Clinic Rochester Minnesota USA.; UsAgainstAlzheimer's Washington District of Columbia USA.,

The primary determinant of drug development is the creation of products that adhere to the highest standards of quality and safety, with a particular emphasis on effectively managing impurities in the therapeutic ingredients. To ensure that the resulting pharmaceutical possesses a high level of safety, meticulous identification, precise quantification, and stringent management of any extraneous components present in the drug ingredient need to be performed. The literature was compiled from different databases, such as DOAJ, PubMed, Research Gate, Google Scholar, Scopus, and Science Direct. Several organic and inorganic contaminants that are frequently present in final products and active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) were covered, along with the crucial section for quality control and fundamental details on their security, toxicity, detection limits, and quantification limitations. Pharmaceutical companies resolve the problem of the presence of impurities by adhering to strict regulatory requirements set by reputable agencies, like the ICH, USFDA, EMA, and PMDA. Also, impurity profiling is required for the regulatory submissions of new drug candidates. In some pharmacopoeias, impurity profiling and reporting are also included. To identify and measure contaminants, a variety of analytical techniques are employed, as discussed in this article. This paper covers the scientific features of contaminants present in pharmaceutical preparations, their prevention strategies, and the application of state-of-the-art analytical techniques for their detection.",,,

This innovative approach aims to improve the prognostication of the system and the identification of treatment-relevant patient populations by more accurately stratifying patients based on tumor biology, representing a significant advancement toward personalized medicine. However, its implementation poses challenges, including the heterogeneous availability of molecular testing worldwide, and the need for further standardization and prospective validation of some of the newly introduced histopathological parameters. To address these innovations and related controversies, a meeting of physicians, including gynecologic oncologists and pathologists, was held. This article summarizes the reflections that emerged from this meeting, focusing on key elements such as the integration of histopathologic features (eg, ""high-grade, aggressive histologic types,"" ""substantial lymphovascular space invasion""), molecular classification, and the implications for global reproducibility and applicability. It also addresses the basic approach toward staging: should it offer integrated, patient-relevant information to enable accurate prognostication and inform treatment decisions or should a staging system simply provide a common language to communicate disease extent? The meeting provided an opportunity for a group of physicians to share considerations on this evolving topic. Our article highlights focal points of change in the new staging system and identifies key areas for future research, advocating for collaborative efforts to generate more robust evidence on some variables introduced in the staging system through prospective studies. By addressing these challenges, we aim to improve the applicability and effectiveness of the new International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics staging system in real-world scenarios and identify elements that may require further refinement, ultimately advancing precision medicine in endometrial cancer care.",Palmieri E; Mariani A; Coleman R; Scambia G,Mayo Clinic; Texas Oncology; Fondazione Policlinico Universitario Agostino Gemelli IRCCS,palmieri.emilia@mayo.edu.

We investigated the performance of common echo measurements, GLS, and their combinations in discriminating CA from an undifferentiated cohort with increased left ventricular wall thickness. We conducted a retrospective single-centre case-control study of 876 echos from 232 patients with CA and 1325 echos from 279 patients who underwent pyrophosphate scintigraphy but had CA definitively ruled out. Common echo measurements were collected and additional GLS measurements were performed post hoc. We reported discrimination performance with the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and associated sensitivity, specificity and positive predictive value at the optimal threshold. We found that the ratio of end-diastolic interventricular septal thickness (IVSd) to GLS had the highest performance in differentiating CA with an AUC of 0.812. At the optimal threshold of >0.15, IVSd/GLS had a sensitivity of 0.70 and specificity of 0.80 for CA. Other measurements and ratios, including the ratio of left ventricular ejection fraction to GLS (AUC 0.682), had lower performance when evaluated against a suspicious control cohort with increased left ventricular wall thickness. If validated in prospective multi-centre studies, the routine measurement of IVSd/GLS can assist with earlier diagnosis of CA, resulting in earlier initiation of treatment in this underserved population.",Daluwatte C; Ricchiuto P,Alexion Pharmaceuticals Inc,piero.ricchiuto@alexion.com.

Among the various Sceletium species, S. tortuosum is used for its mood-enhancing properties, attributed to the structurally related mesembrine-type alkaloids found therein. While significant research has focused on mesembrine and mesembrenone, the therapeutic potential of extracts from plants that produce more of the so-called ""minor alkaloids"", remains unexplored. To assess the CNS modulatory effects of two chemotypes of S. tortuosum, wild-collected from two different geographic locations in South Africa (Touwsrivier and De Rust), each featuring different alkaloid profiles and with elevated minor alkaloid concentrations. Extracts from these chemotypes, as well as a vehicle control and a commercial extract, were administered to four groups of mice for 35 days. Mice were then euthanised, and their frontal cortices, striata and hippocampi dissected. Serotonin, dopamine, noradrenaline, glutamate, and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) concentrations were analysed using LC-MS. Both chemotypes, compared to both control and commercial extract exposure, robustly increased noradrenaline and decreased GABA concentrations in all regions of the mouse brain analysed. This finding may support a mood-enhancing effect of S. tortuosum and indicates its potential to modulate anxiety and stress processing, attention, and alertness. Alkaloid profiling further suggests that the mesembrine alcohols and sceletium A4 may be important contributors in driving these neurochemical changes.",,,kaschula@sun.ac.za.

Disease-related pain is frequently reported as the most troublesome symptom of HS. The SUNSHINE and SUNRISE phase 3 trials previously reported that secukinumab improved control of pain in patients with moderate to severe HS. The objective of this analysis was to evaluate the impact of secukinumab on multiple aspects of pain in patients with HS from SUNSHINE and SUNRISE. Patients were randomised to receive secukinumab 300 mg every 2 (SECQ2W) or 4 weeks (SECQ4W), or placebo until week 16. At week 16, the placebo group switched to receive SECQ2W (placebo-SECQ2W) or SECQ4W (placebo-SECQ4W), whereas the secukinumab groups continued their treatment, until week 52. Pain was assessed using the Patient's Global Assessment of skin pain‒at worst on a continuous numeric rating scale (NRS) through week 52. Quartiles were used to categorise pain severity groups based on baseline NRS scores (NRS ≤ 3.3; NRS > 3.3 to ≤ 5.4; NRS > 5.4 to ≤ 7.2; NRS > 7.2). Additional assessments included quality of life (QoL) and pain medication use. At week 16, a greater mean (standard deviation) absolute change from baseline in skin pain was observed for patients treated with secukinumab [SECQ2W (- 1.35 (2.16)); SECQ4W (- 1.05 (2.02))] versus placebo [- 0.47 (2.07)]. In the SECQ2W and SECQ4W groups, in patients with NRS > 7.2 at baseline, 20.0% and 12.7% had NRS ≤ 3.3 at week 16, respectively. This improvement in pain was maintained through week 52. Moreover, patients in the NRS ≤ 3.3 category generally experienced better QoL. The proportion of patients reporting pain medication use was generally reduced at weeks 16 and 52 versus baseline in the secukinumab groups. This analysis highlights the sustained benefits of secukinumab in reducing pain in patients with moderate to severe HS. These pain reductions were associated with QoL improvements.

40372247,RNA therapeutics-An evaluation of potential occupational health hazards and a strategy to establish occupational exposure limits (OELs).,,Journal of occupational and environmental hygiene,10.1080/15459624.2025.2485080,"RNA therapeutics represent a rapidly expanding and innovative group of pharmaceuticals. These new modalities necessitate the establishment of Occupational Exposure Limits (OELs) to ensure safe occupational handling. While there is an established methodology for setting OELs for small molecule therapeutics, this methodology is not readily applicable to large molecule RNA therapeutics that deserve additional considerations in their safety assessment, particularly for aspects related to their unique modes of action. This research, which involves an extensive review of the data available for RNA therapeutics to derive substance-specific OELs and to propose a strategy for low-characterized RNA therapeutics, fills this crucial gap. It is recommended to apply an activity correction factor (ACF) in the OEL formula for large molecules, as representative of the ""α"" in the OEL formula for small molecules, considering differences in route of administration, critical effects, mechanism of action, and the RNA delivery platform. Additionally, it is proposed to consider lower OEL values for mRNA vaccines as compared to other RNA therapeutics. Finally, it is suggested that the exposure assessment experience that has already been acquired when handling therapeutic proteins can also be used to define containment strategies for RNA therapeutics.

Local complement activation drives C5a generation associated with neutrophil recruitment and activation resulting in skin lesions and inflammation. Here we tested the impact of C5a/C5adesArg, C5 or combined C5 and alternative pathway (AP) targeting on disease development and skin inflammation in a preclinical mouse model mimicking the effector phase of EBA. C57BL/6 mice were treated subcutaneously with purified rabbit anti-mouse-COL7 IgG in the presence of IgG1 mAbs directed against murine C5a/C5adesArg (M031), C5 (mBB5.1), a bifunctional protein comprising mBB5.1 fused to an active fragment of the AP inhibitor factor H (M014) or an IgG1 isotype control mAb. Formation of skin lesions was evaluated 12 days every other day. On day 12, DEJ separation, IgG AAb and C3b deposition and neutrophil infiltration was assessed. Isotype IgG1-treated mice developed first skin lesions on day 4 peaking on day 12. Prophylactic treatment with either M031 or M014 markedly reduced the development of skin lesions, the dermal/epidermal separation and neutrophil recruitment. Surprisingly, C5 or combined AP/C5 inhibition by M014 but not C5a/C5adesArg-targeting by M031 reduced the development of skin lesions and dermal/epidermal separation in the setting of therapeutic treatment. IgG and C3b deposition was not affected by either treatment. Importantly, direct comparison of isolated C5 targeting by mBB5.1 vs. combined AP/C5 inhibition by M014 revealed that M014 reduced the development of skin lesions earlier and more pronounced than mBB5.1.

There were no differences between patients ≥ 70 and < 70 years in clinical remission rates (week 6: 57.5% vs. 47.6%, p = 0.9174; week 14: 62.5% vs. 54.8%, p = 0.1317; week 54: 47.5% vs. 46.4%, p = 0.8149), primary nonresponse (10.0% vs. 15.5%, p = 0.6248), loss of response (12.5% vs. 9.4%, p = 0.5675), or overall safety. Among patients ≥ 70 years, the incidence of adverse drug reactions was numerically greater in those with concomitant corticosteroids than in those without. For older patients with and without late-onset UC, week 54 remission rates were 23.1% versus 57.7% (p = 0.0544); surgery was reported in 3/13 versus 2/26 patients and hospitalization in 5/13 versus 6/26 patients. One death was reported in patients with late-onset UC. VDZ effectiveness and safety were similar in patients ≥ 70 and < 70 years; VDZ may be a suitable treatment option for patients ≥ 70 years with UC. Patients with late-onset UC tended to have more frequent surgery/hospitalization and lower effectiveness than those without, possibly necessitating greater caution when using VDZ.

40369578,Sharing health data for research purposes: results of a population survey in Germany.,2025-05-15,BMC health services research,10.1186/s12913-025-12706-9,"Increased use of health data has the potential to improve both health care and health policies. Several recent policy initiatives at the European and German legislative levels aim to increase the primary and secondary use of health data. However, little is known about general population views on health data access for research. Most studies are based on subsets defined by specific illnesses. We commissioned a national computer-assisted dual-frame telephone survey (landline and mobile). Logit estimation models were used to identify predictors of willingness to provide access to health data to different organizations (universities in Germany, universities worldwide, German government organizations, pharmaceutical companies). A high willingness to share health data for research purposes is observed, depending on the specific data recipient. The willingness is highest for research at universities in Germany and German governmental organizations, and lowest regarding research by pharmaceutical companies. The main drivers for sharing health data are the level of trust in public institutions, the respondents' assessment of the seriousness and likelihood of data misuse, and the level of digital literacy. Age, gender, and level of education have small effects and do not determine the willingness to share health data for all organizations. We present evidence from a random sample of the German population. The results indicate widespread support among the population for providing access to health data for research purposes. Similar to findings in other countries, the willingness depends strongly on the recipient of the data. This paper evaluates the impact of various determinants - identified in previous qualitative and quantitative research - on the willingness of the German population to share health data. While previous studies have found that patients are generally more willing to share health data, we found that the presence of a medical precondition does not translate into respondents' unequivocal support for health data sharing. We identify privacy concerns, general trust, and digital literacy as key factors influencing the willingness to share health data. Therefore, policymakers and stakeholders need to ensure and communicate the necessary privacy protection measures to increase the willingness of the German population to share health data.",Dotter C; Haug S; Schnell R; Raptis G; Weber K,OTH Regensburg; Universität Duisburg-Essen,caroline1.dotter@oth-regensburg.de.

Although the precise pathogenesis and mechanisms of HFS remain unclear, inflammatory reactions are thought to be involved. The preventive effects of topical diclofenac gel have been reported from India. However, the trial did not evaluate its preventive effect for the sole, and the HFS incidence in the control group was lower than that in previous reports. Therefore, this study aims to confirm the preventive effects of diclofenac sodium 0.1% cream for capecitabine-induced HFS. This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial. Patients scheduled to receive capecitabine-containing chemotherapy are enrolled, and participants are prophylactically treated with topical diclofenac sodium 0.1% cream or placebo alongside standard preventive therapy. The primary endpoint is an incidence of grade 2 HFS within 3 months. The secondary endpoints include time to onset of HFS, incidences of dose reduction, schedule delay, discontinuation caused by capecitabine-induced HFS, dose intensity of capecitabine, an incidence of grade ≥ 2 peripheral sensory neuropathy, incidences of other capecitabine-related adverse events (nausea, vomiting, appetite loss, diarrhea, oral mucositis, pigmentation, abnormality of liver and renal functions, and neutropenia). If this study meets the primary endpoint, a new standard preventive therapy for HFS will be established.

40369344,A modular mRNA vaccine platform encoding antigen-presenting capsid virus-like particles enhances the immunogenicity of the malaria antigen Pfs25.,,Nature nanotechnology,10.1038/s41565-025-01889-1,"The COVID-19 pandemic has emphasized the potential of mRNA vaccines in fighting pandemics, owing to their rapid development, strong immunogenicity and adaptability. However, a drawback is their dose-limiting reactogenicity and inability to generate durable humoral immunity. Here we introduce a modular nucleotide vaccine platform combining the advantages of genetic and capsid virus-like-particle-based vaccines. This platform allows for the display of various antigens on different capsid virus-like particles, improving the magnitude, quality and longevity of the vaccine-induced immune responses. We applied this technology to enhance the immunogenicity of the Pfs25 antigen. Immunization with lipid-nanoparticle-formulated mRNA encoding Pfs25 capsid virus-like particles resulted in higher and potentially more durable anti-Pfs25 antibody responses, along with enhanced functional activity, compared with an mRNA vaccine encoding soluble Pfs25. By improving both humoral and cellular immune responses, this approach may reduce the dose and number of administrations required for effective protection. As a result, it can improve the feasibility of both DNA- and mRNA-based vaccines targeting pandemic and endemic infectious diseases.",Fougeroux C; Hagen SH; Goksøyr L; van de Vegte-Bolmer M; van Gemert GJ; Jore MM; de Jongh WA; Sander Bertelsen AF,Department of Medical Microbiology; AdaptVac Aps,asander@sund.ku.dk.

Accordingly, we assessed the predictive ability of prognostic models including MRE scores (MRE Global Score (MEGS), simplified MR Index of Activity (sMARIA), and Lémann index (LI)) against models using clinical predictors alone for the development of modified Beaugerie disabling CD (MBDD) within 5 years of diagnosis. This was a multicentre, diagnostic inception cohort of patients with newly diagnosed CD across 9 UK hospitals, followed for 4 years or more. We censored development of MBDD ≤ 90 days from diagnosis, and used time-to-event models using Royston-Parmer flexible parametric models. We included 194 patients, median age 29, IQR 22-44 years, 52% female. Within 5 years of diagnosis, 42% (81/194) developed MBDD. In univariable analysis, initial steroid requirement was associated with increased risk of developing MBDD (HR 2.11 (95% CI 1.36, 3.26). The baseline clinical model had 49% (39, 60) sensitivity and 66% (57, 74) specificity for predicting the top 40% of patients with the greatest risk of developing MBDD, and 86% (77, 92) sensitivity and 35% (27, 45) specificity for predicting the development of MBDD in patients with an absolute risk of ≥ 10%. There was no significant difference in sensitivity when the MEGS, sMARIA, or LI were added to the baseline clinical model. Addition of MRE scores at diagnosis to a multivariable model comprising clinical predictors did not improve prediction of MBDD within 5 years of diagnosis. Question Magnetic resonance enterography (MRE) is important for diagnosing and monitoring Crohn's disease (CD), but primary research evaluating its prognostic role is lacking. Findings Adding MRE findings at diagnosis to a multivariable model comprising clinical predictors did not improve the prediction of disabling CD within 5 years of diagnosis. Clinical relevance When tested in a prospective, multicentre trial, current MRE activity and damage scores at diagnosis did not reliably predict whether patients would subsequently develop disabling CD. Notwithstanding this finding, MRE remains an essential tool for diagnosis and monitoring.",Eze V,Department of Radiology,stuart.taylor@ucl.ac.uk.

Here, we evaluate the effect of different metabolic and bariatric surgery interventions on the use of medications to treat chronic conditions. This was an observational population-based cohort study performed in Lombardy, Italy. Healthcare utilization databases were used to identify all residents who underwent a metabolic and bariatric surgery procedure between 2010 and 2020 with available follow-up data for at least three years after surgery. We included patients undergoing laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG), gastric bypass (GB), laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding (LAGB), and biliopancreatic diversion (BPD). During the period 2010 to 2020, 19,450 patients (22.5% males, 13.5% with diabetes) underwent a metabolic and bariatric surgery procedure. LSG was the most commonly performed procedure (65%), followed by LAGB (19%), GB (15%), and BPD (1%). There was a significant reduction in the use of glucose-lowering and antihypertensive drugs after the procedure in all groups. Compared to LSG, the reduction in the use of glucose-lowering drugs was greater following GB (reduction at 3 years: 59 vs 65%, p-interaction < 0.001) and lower following LAGB (59 vs 25%, p-interaction < 0.001). There was a significant reduction in lipid-lowering drug use following LSG and GB (3-year reduction: 21 and 50%, p-interaction < 0.001), and in psychiatric drug use following LSG, GB, and LAGB (with no difference between groups). In all groups, proton pump inhibitor use increased during the first 6 months, followed by a decrease from 1 year afterward. The present study including a large number of patients undergoing metabolic and bariatric surgery procedures shows robust reductions in the use of glucose, blood pressure and lipid-lowering drugs at 3 years follow-up, suggesting benefits of surgery on both quality of life and healthcare costs.",Muraca E; Oltolini A; Bongo A,Policlinico di Monza,stefano.ciardullo@unimib.it.

The authors sought to investigate the efficacy of tirzepatide in improving different cardiometabolic risk factors across individuals and subpopulations. Using an independent, global data-sharing and analytics platform, we performed an individual participant data meta-analysis by pooling data from 7 Phase 3 randomized clinical trials that compared tirzepatide with placebo or standard antihyperglycemic agents in individuals with type 2 diabetes. The study outcomes were the presence of a range of cardiometabolic abnormalities, representing components of metabolic syndrome (MetS) (elevated waist circumference, triglycerides, blood pressure, and fasting blood glucose, and decreased high-density lipoprotein cholesterol), as well as elevated body mass index and MetS (≥3 cardiometabolic abnormalities). Outcomes were modeled using mixed-effects models, with inverse probability weighting to account for study design differences. We included 7,805 participants with a weighted median age of 59 years (Q1-Q3: 51-66 years) and 43.2% women. Over a weighted median treatment duration of 41.0 weeks, tirzepatide reduced the odds of all cardiometabolic abnormalities, ranging from 34% reduction for the odds of decreased high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (OR: 0.66 [95% CI: 0.52-0.84]) to 96% reduction in the odds of elevated body mass index (OR: 0.04 [95% CI:0.02-0.08]), and 72% reduction for the odds of MetS (OR: 0.28 [95% CI: 0.24-0.33]). Tirzepatide's superior efficacy in resolving MetS was consistent across demographic and clinical subpopulations, with higher efficacy in age <65 years vs ≥65 years, and in individuals without vs with baseline use of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (P for interaction = 0.008 and 0.009, respectively).

Advances,10.1016/j.jacadv.2025.101767,"Racial and ethnic disparities in cardiovascular disease outcomes, including percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), are well-documented. However, studies do not stratify certain subgroups, such as separating South Asian and East Asian patients, who exhibit varying burdens of cardiovascular disease and PCI outcomes. Additionally, socioeconomic status (SES) further complicates outcomes, with low SES serving as an independent predictor of adverse outcomes post-PCI. This study aimed to analyze PCI outcomes across 5 racial and ethnic groups-White, Black, Hispanic, South Asian, and East Asian populations-while accounting for comorbidities and SES to better understand how race and ethnicity influence cardiovascular outcomes. We conducted a retrospective cohort study of patients undergoing PCI from 2012 to 2022. Patients were stratified by race/ethnicity and matched to median household income based on U.S. Census Zone Improvement Plan code data. The primary endpoint was 1-year major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE). Multivariable Cox regression models were used to assess outcomes, adjusting for comorbidities and SES. A total of 21,236 patients were included: 47.8% White, 11.3% Black, 18.0% Hispanic, 20.7% South Asian, and 2.2% East Asian. South Asian patients had significantly lower MACE (adjusted HR: 0.62; P < 0.001) compared with White patients. Black patients, in contrast, had a higher risk of MACE (adjusted HR: 1.27; P = 0.032). Significant racial and ethnic disparities exist in 1-year PCI outcomes, with South Asian patients exhibiting favorable outcomes compared with White patients, and Black patients experiencing worse outcomes. Baseline comorbidities and estimated SES do not fully explain these disparities, suggesting that targeted strategies are needed to address the multifactorial influences on PCI outcomes across racial and ethnic groups.",,,samin.sharma@mountsinai.org.

The present study examined 3,875 papers published in Radiography, Journal of Medical Imaging and Radiation Sciences, and Journal of Medical Radiation Sciences since their inclusion in the Scopus database. Quantitative bibliometric indicators, including publication counts, citation performance, and mean citations per article/year, were computed using the Bibliometrix package in R Studio. Co-authorship and institutional collaboration networks were visualized using VOSviewer. Keyword co-occurrence analysis was also conducted to identify dominant research areas and trace their evolution over time. Findings revealed a substantial rise in research output, increasing from 15 publications in 1995 to 456 in 2024. Citation impact peaked in 2017, with a gradual decline in subsequent years. The most prolific authors included Hogg P., Bolderston A., and Reed W., while the University of Salford, University of Toronto, and University of Sydney emerged as the leading institutions across the three journals. The United Kingdom, Canada, and Australia were dominant contributors, with a notable rise in participation from African and Asian countries. Funding was primarily supported by national health agencies, cancer-focused organizations, and academic institutions. Keyword analysis revealed nine major thematic clusters, including diagnostic imaging technologies, oncology, clinical practice, education, patient-centered care, and public health. Importantly, eight highly cited papers (≥100 citations) were identified, many of which contributed significantly to the professionalization of radiography, expanded the role of radiographers in diagnostic reporting, and integrated emerging technologies such as AI and digital imaging-marking key milestones in the field's development.

We evaluated changes in body mass index (BMI), body fat percentage, skeletal muscle mass and skeletal muscle mass index (SMI) over 4.4 years on average. This retrospective, single-center clinical cohort study utilized electronic medical records from the University of Tokyo Hospital. 70 people with T2D treated with SGLT2i for more than two years were included. Body compositions were assessed using bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) at three time points: before SGLT2i therapy, 1 year after SGLT2 therapy initiation and the latest along with SGLT2i therapy. During the 4.4-year average treatment period, significant reductions were observed in BMI (30.5 to 29.1, p < 0.0001) and skeletal muscle mass (30.3 kg to 29.0 kg, p < 0.0001). ΔBMI was positively correlated with ΔBody fat percentage and ΔSkeletal muscle mass (all p < 0.0001). Age-stratified analysis showed that in younger individuals, ΔSkeletal muscle mass was significantly associated with both treatment duration and ΔBMI. In contrast, older individuals showed a weaker correlation between ΔSkeletal muscle mass and ΔBMI, and experienced significant muscle mass decline at an earlier point. SGLT2i are effective in managing T2D and reducing BMI and body fat. However, careful monitoring of body composition is crucial, especially in older individuals, to mitigate the risk of sarcopenia and maintain overall health.",,,kmiyoshi-uthp@g.ecc.u-tokyo.ac.jp.
40367577,High levels of benzene in benzoyl peroxide - A sample preparation artefact?,,Journal of pharmaceutical and biomedical analysis,10.1016/j.jpba.2025.116946,"Benzene is a known carcinogen, that can be formed during the degradation of benzoyl peroxide (BPO). Most analytical methods for the analysis of solvents in active pharmaceutical ingredients (API's) do not account for the radical degradation of BPO when in solution, thus resulting in artefactually high amounts of benzene. In this study we proposed and demonstrated that the use of a strong inorganic base (KOH) promotes a fast BPO degradation into benzoic acid. This was confirmed by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). By analyzing pure benzoic acid we confirmed that it is not a source of benzene in its pure form, proving the usefulness of this degradation pathway. Using the USP methodology (based on headspace gas chromatography (HS-GC)) the levels of benzene are around 20 ppm, 100 times higher than results obtained using our proposed methodology (around 0.20 ppm). A comparable amount of benzene, around 0.20 ppm, was determined in three different BPO batches produced in different years (2019, 2021 and 2024,) and stored in controlled conditions. This suggests that the residual amounts of benzene detected derive from the radical induced pathway and not degradation over time. Validation demonstrated linearity, accuracy and precision in the range of 0.1-4.1 ppm of benzene in BPO. In this study benzene was analyzed by headspace gas chromatography mass spectrometry (HS-GC-MS). Our results show the importance of developing robust analytical methods that can generate accurate and trustworthy results when analyzing benzene in BPO.",Dang N; Mattsson J; Lanebjer A; Neto R; Nilsson M,Research and development analytical department,Mikael.Nilsson@cambrex.com.

It remains a major global health issue, with 263 million cases and 597,000 deaths in 2023, primarily affecting young children and pregnant women. This review evaluates awareness, acceptance, hesitancy, and willingness to pay (WTP) for the RTS,S/AS01 malaria vaccine, along with the key factors influencing these outcomes. A comprehensive literature search was conducted in Web of Science, PubMed, and Embase, covering publications up to 18 June 2024. Observational studies assessing awareness, acceptance, hesitancy, and WTP for the malaria vaccine in endemic regions were included. Two independent reviewers screened the studies. Data extraction was performed using Nested Knowledge software and analyzed with R v.4.4. Pooled prevalences were estimated using random-effects models, and heterogeneity was assessed with the I² statistic. Eighteen studies with 21,975 participants provided insights into malaria vaccine dynamics: 32% awareness (95% CI, 18%-50%), 83% acceptance (95% CI, 75%-89%), 14% hesitancy (95% CI, 7%-26%), and 58% WTP (95% CI, 34%-79%). Key determinants of acceptance included age, where younger adults (18-24 years) showed lower acceptance (OR = 0.64, 95% CI, 0.35-0.93). Employment, particularly farmers, had higher acceptance rates (OR = 3.20, 95% CI, 1.00-7.40). Lower socioeconomic status and larger family sizes were associated with decreased acceptance (OR = 0.18, 95% CI, 0.02-0.38). This review revealed an 83% acceptance rate for the malaria vaccine, with variability in awareness (32%), hesitancy (14%), and willingness to pay (58%). Age, employment, and socioeconomic status were significant determinants of acceptance. However, due to potential publication bias and high heterogeneity, these findings should be cautiously interpreted.

The majority of patients currently experiencing but not discussing fatigue with their HCPs at every appointment wished they discussed it more frequently. However, most HCPs reported proactively discussing fatigue at routine appointments. Approximately 20% patients with CD/UC reported declining participation in work/school, social activities, and sports/physical exercise, and avoiding sexual activities due to fatigue. US and European patients with CD/UC experienced severe burden of fatigue, which negatively affected their QoL.

This study investigated whether lifestyle restrictions are associated with relapse reduction and assessed their impact on QOL. This multicenter, prospective cohort study was conducted in Japan (2018-2021) via the YOURS registry, enrolling patients with UC in clinical remission. Patients were followed for 2 years. A baseline questionnaire evaluated lifestyle restrictions in diet, work/study/housework, and physical exercise. QOL was assessed by Disease Impact Scale every 3 months during the first year of follow-up. Associations of lifestyle restrictions with relapse and QOL were assessed by Cox regression analysis and linear mixed-effects models, respectively. Among 911 patients in clinical remission for > 90 days, 63% had adopted dietary avoidance; 47%, work/study/housework avoidance; and 8%, physical exercise avoidance. Overall, 216 patients relapsed. Lifestyle restrictions were not associated with reduced risk of relapse (multivariableadjusted hazard ratios [95% confidence interval]: dietary avoidance, 1.08 [0.81-1.44]; and work/study/housework avoidance, 1.14 [0.87-1.50]); physical exercise avoidance was associated with increased relapse (multivariable-adjusted hazard ratio, 1.58; 95% confidence interval, 1.02-2.44). All lifestyle restrictions were associated with impaired QOL (P <0.01). Lifestyle restrictions were not associated with relapse reduction in patients with UC; however, they were associated with impaired QOL. Clinicians should engage in evidence-based discussions with patients with UC in remission regarding lifestyle restrictions (UMIN Clinical Trials Registry; UMIN000031995).",Limdi JK; McLaughlin JT; Fernandez J,Japan Medical Office; Department of Gastroenterology,

Midazolam has been used as a sedative for hospitalized children on- and off-label; however, factors affecting interindividual variability (IIV) in observed clearance for this population are not fully understood and can result in extreme under- or overexposure. Obesity has been described as a significant influence on midazolam in adolescents, which could potentially alter drug exposure. The goal of this study was to use two modeling strategies to evaluate dose-exposure of midazolam in children with and without obesity. Population pharmacokinetic modeling assessed whether measures of obesity status would explain some of the observed IIV for midazolam clearance. In all, 164 plasma concentrations were collected from 93 participating children, many with obesity. Covariate modeling did not identify any factors influential to clearance beyond body weight. Model IIV was similar to that observed in previous models of critically ill children (coefficient of variation, 175%) along with considerable residual unexplained variability (50.4%). Then, a previously published virtual population of children with obesity was incorporated into an existing physiologically based pharmacokinetic model of midazolam in the open-source PK-Sim software. Dosing simulations for a subset of 46 participants demonstrated minor overpredictions in children with obesity compared to those without. Both models predicted a minor (< 20%) increase in exposure for children with obesity given the same weight-based dose. This research demonstrates the use of population pharmacokinetics combined with physiologically based pharmacokinetic modeling to compare simulated exposures in children with and without obesity.",Anderson SG; Turdalieva S; ,The Emmes Company; ,

Polyphenol extracts from sugarcane molasses (SP) show antioxidant and anti-inflammatory potential, yet their protective effects against ALD have not been elucidated. This study explored the therapeutic potential of SP in alcohol-induced chronic liver damage. A graded alcohol concentration-induced liver damage model was established in C57BL/6J mice to systematically evaluate SP's regulatory effects on liver function markers, lipid metabolism, oxidative stress indicators, inflammatory factors, and related molecular mechanisms through a 10-week nutritional intervention. The results demonstrated that SP intervention significantly inhibited the liver index, alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase activities, and triglyceride and total cholesterol accumulation in mice. SP enhanced antioxidant enzyme activities in a dose-dependent manner, with the high-dose group increasing catalase activity by 161.19% and superoxide dismutase activity by 22.97%. Furthermore, SP significantly reduced the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including interleukin-1β, interleukin-6, and tumor necrosis factor-α, thereby alleviating hepatic inflammatory infiltration. Mechanistic studies revealed that SP effectively mitigated alcohol-induced oxidative stress and inflammatory injury by inhibiting cytochrome P450 2E1 overexpression, regulating the Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 signaling pathway, and suppressing nuclear factor-kappa B pathway activation. The findings reveal that SP mitigates ALD via synergistic antioxidant and anti-inflammatory mechanisms, providing a novel strategy for high-value utilization of sugarcane molasses byproducts in agricultural industries. Future studies should focus on the contribution of the different phenolics in SP and validate their specific hepatoprotective mechanisms.",Zhang C,The Product Makers Co.,

Single-domain variable new antigen receptors (VNAR nanobodies) from nurse sharks are highly soluble, stable, and versatile. Their unique properties suggest advantages over conventional antibodies, particularly for challenging biotherapeutic targets. Here we have used VNAR semi-synthetic phage libraries to select high-affinity fondaparinux-binding VNARs that did not show cross-reactivity with other GAG species. Competition ELISA and surface plasmon resonance identified a single fondaparinux-selective VNAR clone. This VNAR exhibited an extraordinarily stable protein fold: the beta-strands are stabilized by a robust hydrophobic network, as revealed by heteronuclear NMR. Docking fondaparinux to the VNAR structure revealed a large contact surface area between the CDR3 loop of the antibody and the glycan.

Our scoping review aims to investigate the extent of emergency department clinical registries reported in peer-reviewed literature. We conducted a scoping review of ED registries in accordance with the PRISMA-ScR checklist. Searches were undertaken in PUBMED, EMBASE, and SCOPUS. Studies were included if they described a clinical registry with a focus on the ED. We identified 60 manuscripts with 27 identified as primary registries (6 had a general scope, 21 were condition or population specific). The remaining 33 papers were investigational reports sourced from the identified primary registries. Funding sources were identified for some registries: three by research grants, two by medical colleges, five by government organizations or initiatives, two by pharmaceutical companies, and three by research institutes. No funding information was provided in 12 studies. The reported registry periods ranged from 31 days to 4018 days (median 365 days, IQR 181-1309 days). A grey literature search revealed that six registries were ongoing. Internationally, there appears to be a wide degree of heterogeneity with primary ED registry publications and secondary publications. Having a standardized approach to ED registries is needed.

These drugs induce macrocytosis without anemia in most patients. The mechanism for the red blood cell (RBC) changes is unknown. In vitro and animal studies show that RBCs from CDK6-knockout mice have increased membrane fragility, but the clinical impact of CDK4/6is on human RBC lifespan is not known. We sought to determine the impact of CDK4/6is on RBC lifespan and detect changes in the regulation of hemoglobin production. Using the mean corpuscular volume (MCV) measurements at several time points, we can study the evolution of MCV, mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC), and RBC count over time. From this, one can estimate the RBC lifespan under CDK4/6is. We performed a unicentric retrospective study. Based on published models of RBC population dynamics, we have coded a biologically inspired model which allowed us to extract values for biological parameters, including the RBC lifespan. A total of 122 patients were identified, and 1959 laboratory measurements were analyzed. After the pre-treatment RBCs were replaced, the mean MCV increased by 12.6 femtoliter (fL) (95% Bayesian credible interval [CdI] 13-14), the MCHC increased slightly by 0.69 g/dL (95% CdI 0.42-0.96), and the RBC count decreased by 0.77 × 10 These findings suggest that, despite changes in RBC volume, CDK4/6is do not predispose patients to RBC destruction and do not impair regulation of hemoglobin homeostasis.

Our group has developed and validated the use of anti-idiotypic distribution enhancers (AIDEs), which transiently block antibody binding, improving intra-tumoral distribution and efficacy. This study evaluated 1HE and LG1, model anti-trastuzumab AIDEs, in combination with trastuzumab-PE24, a highly potent immunotoxin. The effects of 1HE on the whole-body disposition of radiolabeled trastuzumab were assessed in NCI-N87 tumor-bearing mice. Mechanistic pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) modeling was employed to explore how AIDE binding kinetics influence antibody intra-tumoral distribution and immunotoxin potency. Trastuzumab-PE24 was developed by site-specific conjugation, enabled by self-splicing split intein, with cytotoxicity tested on various cell lines in vitro. The impact of 1HE and LG1 coadministration on trastuzumab-PE24 efficacy was evaluated in NCI-N87 xenograft-bearing mice. 1HE coadministration decreased trastuzumab tumor maximum concentration, reducing tumor terminal slope by 8% and overall tumor exposure by 2.6%, without negatively affecting selectivity. Modeling predicted the optimal AIDE dissociation rate constant for trastuzumab-PE24 to be between 0.015 and 0.3 h AIDE coadministration led to minimal negative impacts on overall tumor exposure, consistent with model simulations. AIDE coadministration improved the efficacy of trastuzumab-PE24 in NCI-N87 xenografts. Modeling further predicted that repeated AIDE administration with trastuzumab-PE24 could induce complete tumor regression. These findings highlight the advantages of the AIDE strategy, particularly when coadministered with highly potent immunotoxins.",,,

The objective of this study is to examine the effect of DSME on different types of costs in older Medicare beneficiaries with diabetes. This was a pooled cross-sectional study using the Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey (MCBS). The use of DSME was reported by survey respondents. Economic outcomes included total medical costs, total diabetes-related medical costs, total prescription costs, and total anti-diabetic prescription costs were measured based on Medicare claims and prescription drug events data from the perspective of the Medicare system. All costs were adjusted to 2012 U.S. dollars using the Consumer Price Index (CPI). Generalized linear models, with a log link and gamma distribution, were used to examine the effect of DSME on different costs. A total of 3,003 older Medicare beneficiaries with diabetes were included, among whom 35.50% (n = 1,066) had DSME. Individuals who did not have DSME had significantly higher total prescription costs than those who had DSME ($4,398.19 vs. $3,966.82, P =.0134).

Pharmaceutical industries and regulatory authorities are continuing to adopt new technologies to improve the efficiency of the drug development process. However, over the decades the pharmaceutical industries were not able to accelerate the drug development process. The pandemic (COVID-19) has taught the pharmaceutical industries and regulatory agencies an expensive lesson showing the need for emergency preparedness by accelerating the drug development process.

The primary endpoint was objective response rate (ORR) per RECIST 1.1 criteria. Among 30 patients enrolled, the median TMB was 10.9 mut/Mb (range: 9-110) and the confirmed objective response rate was 20%. Secondary endpoints included progression-free survival, overall survival, clinical benefit rate, and safety and tolerability, including immune-related adverse events (irAEs). A prespecified correlative outcome was to evaluate the ORR in patients with a TMB ≥ 14 mut/Mb. Patients with TMB ≥ 14 mut/Mb (n = 6) experienced higher response rates (60% vs 12%; p = 0.041) and showed a trend towards improved progression-free survival and overall survival compared to patients with TMB < 14 mut/Mb. Exploratory genomic analyses suggested that ESR1 and PTEN mutations may be associated with poor response, while clinical benefit was associated with a decrease or no change in tumor fraction by serial circulating tumor DNA during treatment. Stool microbiome analysis revealed that baseline blood TMB, PD-L1 positivity, and immune-related diarrhea are associated with distinct taxonomic profiles. In summary, some patients with hypermutated HER2-negative MBC experience extended clinical benefit with a dual immunotherapy regimen; a higher TMB, and additional genomic and microbiome biomarkers may optimize patient selection for therapy with nivolumab plus low-dose ipilimumab.

Here we describe a role for Growth Differentiation Factor 3 (GDF3) on mature adipocyte biology. We find inducible GDF3 loss of function in obese adult mice leads to reduced lipolysis, improved glucose tolerance, and reduced glycemic variability. The effects on lipolysis are driven by lower levels of β3-adrenergic receptor, decreased cAMP and PKA signaling. GDF3 is an ALK5, ALK7, ACVR2A and ACVR2B agonist and also a BMPR2 antagonist. Unlike ALK7 or activin E knockouts, acute GDF3 loss of function does not affect body weight or energy balance but significantly improves metabolic health. These results suggest that blocking GDF3 can improve metabolic health independent of body weight and food intake, an intriguing new model for developing anti-diabetic therapies. Together these results provide much-needed clarity to both the molecular pathways involved in GDF3 signaling and its physiological effects.",,,asbanks@bidmc.harvard.edu.

Vaccines are a lifesaving intervention proven to reduce child mortality from specific diseases. Non-specific effects of vaccines may further affect all-cause child mortality. This analysis explores the association between vaccination status and child survival for children 12-59 months of age, using data from the INSPIRING trial in Jigawa, Nigeria (registration: ISRCTN39213655). Descriptive analysis and logistic regression were used, with multivariate models adjusting for the study design and child age, sex, malnutrition, maternal education, maternal age, compound size and wealth quintile. Interaction effects for child sex were explored given evidence for non-specific effects of vaccines. We found all groups of vaccinated children to have reduced mortality compared to unvaccinated children. Children that completed the Nigerian vaccination schedule, i.e. received the second measles vaccine dose, had the lowest odds of death, with a 70 % reduction in mortality compared to an unvaccinated child (AOR: 0.30, CI: 0.18, 0.49, p-value <0.001).

This study supports evidence that vaccines have non-specific effects on all-cause child mortality. Unvaccinated children had the highest odds of death between 12 and 59 months of age and must be reached through vaccination to improve their chances of survival. In this setting, receiving a second measles vaccine was associated with a large reduction in child mortality, and may be an effective focus for outreach campaigns in Northern Nigeria.",Beard J; ,Independent Consultant; ,elizabeth.patrick@alumni.ucl.ac.uk.

Compared with blank control check (CK), the WBM-treated non-waxy foxtail millet flour showed reduced structural ordering, lower enthalpy, improved gelatinization, and produced a more rigid conformation, while the WBM-treated waxy foxtail millet flour showed increased structural ordering, higher enthalpy, lower regrowth, and better viscosity. The results suggest that WBM modifies foxtail millet flour by mechanical action to improve the material quality, which provides a scientific basis for its application in different foxtail millet foods.",,,909479470@qq.com.

However, IMS is a relatively new technology that requires further validation before being accepted by authorities for regulatory compliance of new drugs. In 2020, an international survey was conducted in collaboration with the Imaging Mass Spectrometry Society (IMSS) and the Japan Association for Imaging Mass Spectrometry (JAIMS) to understand the status of IMS and to identify problems with its application. The survey revealed technical challenges in sample preparation, quantitative analysis of drugs in tissues, and data acquisition. Based on the 2020 survey results, we recently conducted a further detailed survey and had discussions within the JAIMS aimed at translating the results into specific experimental procedures and proposing feasible standard methods. This survey involved detailed questions on five themes: sample collection and storage, tissue section preparation, sample preparation, data analysis (including quantitative analysis and data correction methods), and data reproducibility. The questions were answered by JAIMS members working for ten companies.

This study aimed to assess the impact of creatinine clearance (Ccr) on non-hematologic toxicities, including nausea and vomiting, in patients with mCRC treated with TAS-102. This study was conducted as a post-hoc analysis of the JASCC-CINV2001 study, a multicenter observational study of mCRC patients. Using a Cox proportional hazards model, we assessed the relationship between Ccr and nausea or vomiting, and used a generalized estimating equations (GEE) logistic regression model to analyze the association between Ccr and additional toxicities, including fatigue, constipation, diarrhea, insomnia, and dysgeusia. Toxicities were evaluated at weekly intervals over four weeks. Among 100 patients, median Ccr was 80.5 ml/min. The primary analysis showed no significant association between Ccr and nausea or vomiting. However, the secondary analysis revealed a significant link between lower Ccr and the incidence of diarrhea (P = 0.02). These results suggest that although TAS-102-induced nausea and vomiting are not strongly influenced by renal function, decreased renal function increases the risk of diarrhea. Enhanced antiemetic measures may not be necessary for TAS-102 patients with impaired renal function, but monitoring for diarrhea is recommended.",,,iihara.hirotoshi.p7@f.gifu-u.ac.jp.

Pharmacological inhibition of adenosine generation and signaling is an active area of clinical investigation, but only limited clinical benefit has been reported. Here, we show that adenosine suppresses anti-cancer T cell responses following uptake into activated T cells by equilibrative nucleoside transporter 1 (ENT1) and inhibition of de novo pyrimidine nucleotide synthesis. We identify EOS301984 as a potent ENT1 antagonist that restores pyrimidine levels in activated T cells in adenosine-rich environments, resulting in enhanced tumor cell killing by memory T cells and increased ex vivo expansion of functional human tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes. A combination of EOS301984 with anti-PD-1 led to synergistic control of tumor growth in a humanized mouse model of triple-negative breast cancer.

Qualifying prodromal events were defined as attacks with symptoms in which the participant was confident headache would follow within 1-6 h. Of 1,087 screened participants, 477 formed the efficacy analysis population. Outcomes were collected across 48 h showing, for example, at 2 h post-dose, absence of photophobia in 19.5% and 12.5% of ubrogepant- and placebo-treated events, respectively (odds ratio (OR) = 1.72 (95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.13-2.61)); at 3 h post-dose, absence of fatigue occurred in 27.3% and 16.8% (OR = 1.85 (95% CI = 1.17-2.92)) and absence of neck pain in 28.9% and 15.9% (OR = 2.04 (95% CI = 1.25-3.32)) of events; at 4 h post-dose, absence of phonophobia in 50.7% and 35.8% (OR = 1.97 (95% CI = 1.38-2.80)) of events; and at 24 h post-dose, absence of dizziness in 88.5% and 82.3% (OR = 1.82 (95% CI = 1.00-3.30)) of events.

Given the high heritability of psychiatric disorders, psychiatry has potentially much to gain from the application of genomics to identify molecular risk mechanisms and to improve diagnosis. Recent large-scale, genome-wide association studies and sequencing studies, together with advances in functional genomics, have begun to illuminate the genetic architectures of schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and major depressive disorder and to identify potential biological mechanisms.

Semi-solid extrusion (SSE) as a way of 3D printing has shown a substantial potential in personalized medicine for pediatric patients. However, manufacturing tablets through 3D printing is a slow process and might be a bottleneck when many personalized dosages are needed for pediatric use. Here, we use a simplified SSE printing approach for preparing propranolol, spironolactone, and prednisolone tablets (n=144 of each) with different dosages. The quality control approach for the tablets included the development of HPLC methods for each drug based on their physicochemical properties and investigation of mass and content uniformity, stability, and dissolution. The average dosing accuracy of the tablets was 93.1% (propranolol), 96.0% (spironolactone) and 96.7% (prednisolone) showing good mass uniformity. All the formulations showed an appropriate homogeneity (AV<15) and stability up to 9 months. Dissolution results of the tablets were in compliance with acceptance criteria (USP) for immediate release dosage forms, i.e., 80% of drug released within 45 minutes. The osmolality of placebo, propranolol, spironolactone, and prednisolone tablets were 86, 81, 78, and 75 mOsm/kg, respectively. These osmolality values were well below the recommended osmolality of pediatric formulations, i.e., < 450 mOsm/kg. Finally, drug recovery tests via nasogastric tube (NGT) were performed with different reconstitution volumes and temperatures. The drug losses varied between 4-36%.

We aimed to investigate whether a natural product, halofuginone (HF), could overcome NSCLC resistance to EGFR-TKIs by influencing metabolism. In our study, the combination of HF and EGFR-TKI exhibited synergistic cytotoxicity compared to EGFR-TKI monotherapy. The underlying mechanism is that HF promotes the degradation of SP1 protein and decreases the expression of phosphatidylserine transcarbamoylase 1 (PSAT1), which leads to defects in the de novo synthesis of Serine/Glycine and cell death.

In this study, we aimed to investigate the efficacy of water-soluble extract of Rubus coreanus (MN705) in preventing kidney fibrosis in a mouse model of unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO) and in an in vitro model of TGF-β-challenged HK-2 cells. Male C57BL/6 mice (7 weeks old) were randomly assigned to the sham/vehicle (distilled water), sham/MN705 (600 mg/kg/day), UUO/vehicle, UUO/MN705-low dose (300 mg/kg/day), and UUO/MN705-high dose (600 mg/kg/day) groups. After 7 days of pre-treatment, sham or UUO operation was performed, and treatment drugs were administered at the same dose for 7 days. In addition, HK-2 cells and human renal proximal tubular epithelial cells were cultured and challenged with TGF-β (2 ng/ml) with or without an extract of Rubus coreanus (0.05-0.2 mg/ml). In the histopathological specimen of Masson's trichrome stain, areas of kidney interstitial fibrosis were attenuated in the treatment group (10.6 ± 1.3% area vs. 17.2 ± 2.3% area, P < 0.001). In the western blot analysis, protein abundance of α-SMA (12.9 ± 5.9 vs. 19.8 ± 3.1 fold changes compared to sham group, P = 0.046) significantly decreased in the treatment group. In the in vitro experiment, HK-2 cells treated with TGF-β and MN705 showed a dose-dependent significant decrease in the protein expression of fibronectin and phospho-Smad2/3 with increase of MnSOD. The extract of Rubus coreanus attenuates kidney fibrosis in the UUO mouse model and TGF-β-treated human kidney proximal tubular cells.

Our previous work identified that, on Twitter (now X), almost 25% of tweets about the HPV vaccine contain misinformation, and these tweets receive higher audience engagement than accurate tweets. Exposure to misinformation can increase vaccine hesitancy, but the types of misinformation found on social media vary widely, and not all misinformation exposure influences vaccine attitudes and vaccine uptake. Despite the prevalence of misinformation and antivaccine information on social media, little work has assessed parents' assessments of these posts. This study examines which types of misinformation on Twitter parents find the most concerning. In April 2022, we surveyed 263 US parents of children ages 7-10 years using a Qualtrics survey panel. They viewed a first round of 9 randomly selected tweets from a pool of 126 tweets circulating on Twitter that contained misinformation about the HPV vaccine. Then parents selected up to 3 that they found most concerning. The process was repeated once more with 9 selected from the pool of 117 messages not shown in the first round. Using this information, a concern score for each tweet was calculated based on the number of parents who viewed the tweet and selected it as concerning. In total, 2 researchers independently coded the misinformation tweets to identify rhetorical strategies used and health concerns mentioned. Multiple linear regression tested whether tweet content significantly predicted the concern score of the tweet. Parental concern about the different misinformation tweets varied widely, with some misinformation being selected as most concerning just 2.8% of the time it was viewed and other misinformation being selected 79.5% of the time it was viewed. Multiple beta regression analyses found that misinformation tweets using negative emotional appeals (b=.79, P<.001), expressing pharmaceutical company skepticism (b=.36, P=.036), invoking governmental authority (b=.44, P=.02), and mentioning hospitalization (b=1.00, P=.003), paralysis (b=.54, P=.02), and infertility (b=.52, P=.04) significantly increased the percent of parents rating the misinformation tweets as most concerning. Misinformation about HPV vaccination is ubiquitous on social media, and it would be impossible to target and correct all of it. Counter-messaging campaigns and interventions to combat misinformation need to focus on the types of misinformation that concern parents and ultimately may impact vaccine uptake. Results from this study identify the misinformation content that parents find most concerning and provide a useful list of targets for researchers developing interventions to combat misinformation with the goal of increasing HPV vaccine uptake.",,,

There is also concern that bedtime antihypertensive use could induce glaucoma-related visual loss or other hypotensive/ischemic adverse effects. To determine the effect of bedtime vs morning administration of antihypertensive medications on major cardiovascular events and death. Multicenter, open-label, pragmatic randomized clinical trial with blinded end-point assessment and recruitment via 436 primary care clinicians across 5 Canadian provinces inviting their community-dwelling adult patients with hypertension taking at least 1 once-daily antihypertensive medication. Participants were recruited from March 31, 2017, to May 26, 2022, with final follow-up on December 22, 2023. Participants were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to using all once-daily antihypertensive medications either at bedtime (intervention group; n = 1677) or in the morning (control group; n = 1680). The primary outcome was time to first occurrence of all-cause death or hospitalization/emergency department (ED) visit for stroke, acute coronary syndrome, or heart failure. All-cause unplanned hospitalizations/ED visits, and visual, cognitive, and fall- and/or fracture-related safety outcomes were also assessed. A total of 3357 adults (56.4% female; median age, 67 years; 53.7% taking monotherapy) were randomized and followed up for a median of 4.6 years in each treatment group. The composite primary outcome event occurred at a rate of 2.3 per 100 patient-years in the bedtime group and 2.4 per 100 patient-years in the morning group (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.77-1.19; P = .70). Individual components of the primary outcome, all-cause hospitalizations/ED visits, and safety outcomes did not differ between groups. In particular, there was no difference in falls or fractures, new glaucoma diagnoses, or 18-month cognitive decline. Among adults with hypertension in primary care, bedtime administration of antihypertensive medications was safe but did not reduce cardiovascular risk. Antihypertensive medication administration time did not affect the risks and benefits of blood pressure-lowering medication and instead should be guided by patient preferences.

Unanchored MAICs were performed using individual patient-level data (IPD) for all apheresed patients randomized to the cilta-cel arm of CARTITUDE-4 (n = 208) and published arm-level data for EloPd from ELOQUENT-3 (n = 60), IsaKd from IKEMA (lenalidomide-refractory subgroup, n = 57), IsaPd from ICARIA-MM (n = 154), and SVd from BOSTON (lenalidomide-refractory subgroup, n = 53). Eligibility criteria from each comparator trial were applied to the cilta-cel arm IPD, and further imbalances in patient characteristics were adjusted by weighting the cilta-cel patient data to match the reported baseline characteristics of the comparator trials. Comparative efficacy was estimated for overall response rate, very good partial response or better (≥ VGPR) rate, complete response or better (≥ CR) rate, progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS). After adjustment, cilta-cel patients were significantly more likely to achieve an overall response versus EloPd, IsaPd, and SVd, and were significantly more likely to achieve ≥ VGPR and ≥ CR versus all comparators.

The Pharma Collaboration for Transparent Medical Information (phactMI™) benchmarking survey of 35 US pharmaceutical companies was conducted to describe the current landscape and future opportunities of other services Medical Information could provide. In July 2023, an electronic survey containing 57 closed and open-ended questions was distributed to phactMI member companies. The survey questions addressed demographics, medical review, development of materials, training, patient services, insights, and awareness. Medical Information is a significant contributor to the medical review of promotional healthcare provider materials (51%), patient materials (52%), and non-promotional medical materials (45%). Medical Information ensures the accuracy of medical information, fact checks and validates claim accuracy. Fifty percent of the respondents are responsible for reviewing and/or contributing to Medical Affairs material for Field Medical. Additionally, Medical Information trains both Field Medical and Sales teams on the Medical Information function, and to a lesser extent, disease state information. The majority (75%) of Medical Information Departments offer patient information. The vast majority (85%) produce and identify insights. Medical Directors, Field Medical, and Scientific Communications/ Publications often receive shared insights. Fewer individuals integrate insights with Field Medical and Medical Directors. Since 2018, Medical Information activities have seen a rise in advisory board presentations, insights reporting, publications, competitive intelligence, disease state education, surveillance, pathway submission, and labelling activities. Building awareness is still an important aspect of Medical Information and most focus on the development of their Medical Information website. The essential roles and activities of Medical Information Departments support products at every stage. Medical Information participates with multiple functions in evaluating medical materials and there is a growing trend of including Medical Information in the development and review of Medical Affairs materials. Medical Information has expanded its participation in pathway submissions, publications, and labeling activities.

To provide the guidance regarding how to act in future pandemics, we investigated the changes in breast cancer (BC) diagnosis and treatment during the COVID-19 pandemic. The trends of monthly data were calculated in relation to the variables of a total of 291,018 primary BCs registered on the Japanese National Clinical Database between January 2018 and April 2021. An analysis of the nationwide data during the pandemic showed 9% decrease of newly identified BC compared with before the pandemic. The impact was more relevant in the 40-50, 51-60 and 61-70-years age groups (13%, 8% and 9% decrease, respectively). The most substantial reduction was noted in patients identified through screenings without symptoms with a 17% decrease.

A review of literature from the past ten years across PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science focused on immunotherapy strategies. These include immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte therapy, antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs), cancer vaccines, CAR T-cell therapy, and the role of the gut microbiome. While immunotherapy outcomes have improved, particularly for tumor types such as melanoma and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), challenges persist regarding predictive biomarker identification and better management.

Drawing on three varied datasets, we forward a relational approach to medicalization that responds to critiques while aiming to reinvigorate the theory with new concepts and questions. In contrast to prior process-based work, our relational approach argues that medicalization is best understood as an action or activity undertaken by specific groups or actors. We further suggest that unequal relations characterize medicalization. Specifically, we argue that 1) groups or actors receive a benefit from participating in medicalization, which we call the medicalizing dividend and, 2) an actor/group occupies a hegemonic position in medicalizing relations, reaping the largest dividend and constraining other actors. While we assert that pharmaceutical companies are currently hegemonic, we argue that their hegemony is not indefinite. We discuss how our approach facilitates links between medicalization and other theories, while outlining future steps for medicalization research.",,,

To comprehensively unravel the mechanisms of EGFR-TKI resistance, we establish a biobank of patient-derived EGFR-mutant lung cancer organoids, encompassing cases previously treated with EGFR-TKIs. Through comprehensive molecular profiling including single-cell analysis, here we identify a subgroup of EGFR-TKI-resistant LUAD organoids that lacks known resistance-related genetic lesions and instead exhibits a basal-shift phenotype characterized by the hybrid expression of LUAD- and squamous cell carcinoma-related genes. Prospective gene engineering demonstrates that NKX2-1 knockout induces the basal-shift transformation along with EGFR-target therapy resistance. Basal-shift LUADs frequently harbor CDKN2A/B loss and are sensitive to CDK4/6 inhibitors. Our EGFR-mutant lung cancer organoid library not only offers a valuable resource for lung cancer research but also provides insights into molecular underpinnings of EGFR-TKI resistance, facilitating the development of therapeutic strategies.",,,hiroyukiyasuda@keio.jp.

The MANAGE-PD tool ( www.managepd.eu ) was developed to help identify patients with advanced PD and to facilitate treatment decision making and appropriate allocation of patients to device-aided therapies (DAT). This prospective, non-interventional study aimed to investigate the real-world disease burden of PD and treatment optimization after MANAGE-PD implementation. Adult PD patients (N = 278) visited specialist clinics and neurologist's practices in Germany in 2022. Disease burden was assessed using the Unified PD rating scale (UPDRS parts II-IV), the non-motor symptoms scale (NMSS) and the 8-item Parkinson's disease Questionnaire (PDQ-8). Data on planned treatment changes were collected. Data were analyzed by disease control categories according to the MANAGE-PD tool. Mean scores for motor and non-motor symptoms, quality of life, and comorbidity burden were worse in patients with lower disease control measured by MANAGE-PD. For 52.8% of patients in Category 2 (inadequately controlled-might benefit from oral optimization), no change in oral treatment was planned. No change in oral treatment and no DAT initiation was planned for 37.9% and 65.0% of patients in Category 3 (inadequately controlled-might benefit from DAT). Patient refusal and needing more time to decide were the most common reasons for not making treatment changes.

Globally, startups play a significant role in advancing drug discovery. The author's research demonstrated that startups have recently expanded their role to late-entry drug discovery, the area where large pharmaceutical companies traditionally had strength, while maintaining their contribution to first-in-target drug discovery. Despite the growing importance of startups, Japan has faced challenges in fostering successful drug discovery startups, falling particularly behind in leveraging modality technologies. The development of promising startups requires the establishment of a robust startup ecosystem, as seen in the U.S. and certain European countries. Japan's ecosystem for supporting drug discovery startups remains fragile due to factors such as low entrepreneurial activity, limited labor mobility, and insufficient investment capital. The author's research has revealed that in Japan's unlisted drug discovery startups, ""being a corporate spin-off"" and ""having a leader in research and development with prior experience in corporate R&D"" positively impact the startup's valuation and total funding amounts. In Japan, large pharmaceutical companies still account for the majority of new drug discoveries, with a wealth of promising drug discovery seeds and experienced R&D talent accumulated within these corporations. Facilitating the creation of corporate spin-offs that utilize unexploited seeds within large companies and promoting the transfer of corporate talent to startups could strengthen Japan's drug discovery ecosystem. This paper will also explore potential policy measures to encourage these developments.",,,

Antibody-IL-2 fusion proteins capable of preferential tumor localization have shown encouraging signs of activity in clinical trials; however, they typically cause side effects shortly after intravenous administration, which may limit escalation to curative doses. There is an urgent need to engineer IL-2 products with ""activity-on-demand"" able to mask on-target off-tumor IL-2 activity without compromising therapeutic efficacy. To design IL-2 biopharmaceuticals with ""activity-on-demand"", which would be non-toxic on administration but regain activity at the tumor site, we explored the therapeutic potential of the co-administration of signaling inhibitors with matched pharmacokinetic properties. In this work, we used the tumor-homing F8-IL2 fusion protein, specific to a splice variant of fibronectin, and masked off-tumor toxicity by co-administration of upadacitinib, which rapidly clears from circulation. Vascular leak syndrome was monitored by histopathological analysis, the extent of peripheral edema, and cytokine levels. Immune profiling of the tumors and secondary lymphoid organs was performed by flow cytometry. In immunocompetent tumor-bearing mice, the combinatorial treatment significantly improved tolerability without any detectable loss of therapeutic activity, protecting the mice from body weight loss, uncontrolled systemic cytokine release, and severe vascular leak syndrome manifestations, including peripheral edema. F8-IL2 efficiently controlled tumor growth and retained its immunological activity within the neoplastic mass, as evidenced by the massive natural killer and cytotoxic T-cell infiltrates. This study suggests that combinatorial treatments enable the administration of potentially curative doses of targeted IL-2 products while sparing healthy organs from life-threatening toxicities.",Rotta G; Prodi E; Bocci M; Gilardoni E; Comacchio C; Puca E; Neri D; Dakhel Plaza S,Philochem AG,sheila.dakhel@philochem.ch.

PK was characterized by a 2-compartment model with linear elimination and zero-order absorption with lag time. Bioequivalence was met for all steady state exposure metrics for both doses under fasted conditions. A milligram strength for nilotinib tablets ~ 50% lower than that for capsules resulted in bioequivalent nilotinib exposures. Administration with a low-fat meal under modified fasting conditions increased the bioavailability (BA) of 142 mg and 190 mg nilotinib tablets by 26.0% and 29.3%, respectively, vs. fasting; values for 300 mg and 400 mg capsules were 56.8% and 60.7%.

This randomised, double-blind trial across 48 US sites including hospitals, private and group practices, and independent research centres included participants at least 18 years old with pre-existing or high risk for ASVCD or heterozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia with LDL cholesterol concentrations of 1·8 mmol/L (70 mg/dL) or greater despite maximally tolerated lipid-lowering therapy excluding ezetimibe, or having statin intolerance. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1:1:1) to obicetrapib 10 mg plus ezetimibe 10 mg FDC, obicetrapib 10 mg monotherapy, ezetimibe 10 mg monotherapy, or placebo administered daily for 84 days. The co-primary endpoints in the intention-to-treat population were the percent LDL cholesterol changes in the FDC group compared with placebo, ezetimibe monotherapy, and obicetrapib monotherapy, and the placebo-adjusted change in the obicetrapib monotherapy group. The trial was prospectively registered (NCT06005597) and is completed. Between March 4 and July 3, 2024, 407 participants were randomly assigned. The median age was 68·0 years (IQR 62·0-73·0) and 177 (43%) were female.

Altered serotonergic neurotransmission is linked to conditions such as anxiety, depression, anorexia, migraine, insomnia, schizophrenia, Alzheimer's disease (AD), and cognitive impairments. The 5-HT6 receptor (5-HT6R), mainly found in brain regions involved in cognition, is a promising therapeutic target for cognitive deficits in neuropsychiatric disorders, particularly AD and schizophrenia. Preclinical studies have shown that 5-HT6R antagonists improve cognitive function. 5-HT6R interacts dynamically with an extensive intracellular protein network, regulating the localisation, trafficking, and signalling of these proteins. Proteomic and genetic studies have revealed interactions with mTOR kinase and neurofibromin, both of which are crucial for synaptic plasticity, learning, and memory. Fyn kinase is also associated with 5-HT6Rs, reinforcing receptor expression and G-protein coupling. Notably, the G protein-regulated inducer of neurite outgrowth 1 (GPRIN1) interacts with 5-HT6Rs independently of agonists, enhancing receptor activity. This review highlights the clinical testing of 5-HT6R ligands as regulators of these complex signalling properties, underscoring their therapeutic potential in addressing cognitive impairments associated with neuropsychiatric disorders.",De Deurwaerdère P,Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique,

Metabolic dysfunctions, particularly type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), have been implicated in AD pathogenesis, highlighting the potential for novel therapeutic approaches targeting shared underlying mechanisms. Here, we investigate sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibition as a therapeutic strategy for AD using Enavogliflozin, a potent SGLT2 inhibitor, in the 5XFAD mouse model. Five-month-old 5XFAD mice were treated with Enavogliflozin (0.1 or 1 mg/kg) or vehicle for 8 weeks. The higher dose significantly improved cognitive performance in Y-maze and Morris Water Maze tests, which correlated with enhanced synaptic plasticity and increased acetylcholine levels. Moreover, Enavogliflozin treatment reduced Aβ pathology and plaque burden, particularly affecting larger plaques. Mechanistically, SGLT2 inhibition attenuated neuroinflammation by suppressing NF-κB signaling and proinflammatory cytokine production while promoting microglial recruitment to plaques. In vitro and ex vivo analyses further revealed that Enavogliflozin enhances microglial phagocytic capacity via AMPK-mediated mitochondrial biogenesis and function. These findings highlight the multifaceted neuroprotective effects of SGLT2 inhibition in AD, demonstrating its potential to mitigate pathology and improve cognitive function. By uncovering its impact on neuroinflammation and microglial function, this study establishes SGLT2 inhibition as a promising therapeutic avenue for AD and other neurodegenerative disorders.",,,

This study examines the impact of the conflict on a less publicized sector of Sudan's health system: the national pharmaceutical manufacturing and supply chain. Research interviews were conducted with representatives of 4 companies engaged in pharmaceutical manufacturing and/or supply in Sudan, in addition to a review of primary information from medical regulators and industry associations. Based on these interviews, 3 case studies are presented; insights from the fourth interview inform the study overall. All 4 companies reported significant impacts on their operations, as well as on other companies in the pharmaceutical sector. Domestic pharmaceutical manufacturing has effectively come to a halt, leading to the non-availability of certain drugs in parts of the country. Manufacturers have shifted course to focus on imports, but heavy losses of domestically stored inventory and an inability to distribute medicines to large parts of the country have had a significant impact on pharmaceutical supply to retail pharmacies, public and private sector health facilities, and the National Medical Supplies Fund (NMSF).

Detailed data on optimal postoperative follow-up evaluation of cStage I ESCC are lacking. This study aimed to evaluate the frequency, characteristics, and predictors of postoperative recurrence in patients with cT1bN0M0 cStage I ESCC. The study analyzed 210 patients who underwent surgery for cT1bN0M0 cStage I ESCC and a follow-up computed tomography (CT) examination in the prospective multicenter study, JCOG0502. The study categorized the characteristics of postoperative recurrences such as the recurrence sites and whether regional/non-regional lymph nodes (LNs) and single/multiple organs were involved. Backward elimination was applied (p < 0.2) to identify postoperative recurrence predictors and obtained hazard ratios (HRs) based on Fine and Gray's model. Postoperative recurrence was experienced by 31 patients (14.8%) at one or more of the following sites: regional LNs (n = 18), non-regional LNs (n = 10), lung (n = 2); bone (n = 2), and liver, local recurrence, skin, pleura, pericardium, and other (n = 1 each). In four patients, the first recurrence developed in multiple organs. The median interval between trial registration and the first recurrence was 18.6 months. In multivariable analyses, pathologic nodal metastasis (hazard ratio [HR], 3.29; p = 0.003), tumor location in the upper-thoracic esophagus versus lower-thoracic esophagus (HR, 6.71; p = 0.013), and two-field lymphadenectomy (HR, 4.31; p = 0.001) were independently associated with the development of postoperative recurrence.

Its main difficulty lies in the strong repulsion between the lone pair electrons on the N and O atoms, which makes their N─O bond easy to break, leading to a over-reduction to amine compounds. Here, we present a green electrocatalytic strategy for the first time that converts oximes to hydroxylamines over CuS. Specially, N-benzylhydroxylamine was achieved with 95% conversion and 80% selectivity from benzaldoxime at -0.9 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode. Mechanistic investigations reveal that CuS can optimize the adsorption energy of the reaction intermediates, making the N─O bond more difficult to cleave during the electrocatalytic hydrogenation, thus leading to a high selectivity formation of hydroxylamines. This methodology is successfully extended to other hydroxylamines and further enables the unprecedented synthesis of organic hydroxylamines from nitric oxide gas. Our work establishes a sustainable electrosynthetic platform for hydroxylamines synthesis without organic solvents and additional reduction agents, providing new insights for modern green chemical synthesis.",,,

We found that LOG improved zebrafish cardiac function and mitigated the upregulation of CK-MB, cTnT, nppa, and nppb caused by DOX. Moreover, LOG suppressed the high levels of ROS, GSSG, and MDA in response to DOX and increased GSH activity and gpx4 levels in zebrafish. Additionally, LOG increased cell viability and the GSH/GSSG ratio, reduced oxidative damage and the accumulation of ferrous ions, and maintained mitochondrial function in H9C2 cells. Mechanistically, LOG improved the abnormal expression of key genes in the PPAR signaling pathway and ferroptosis induced by DOX. In conclusion, our study emphasized that LOG attenuates DIC by mitigating oxidative stress-triggered lipid peroxidation related to the inhibition of PPAR-mediated ferroptosis.",,,xjguodd@163.com.

Similarly, patients with moderate-to-severe EPVS in the basal ganglia region had a significantly poor clinical outcome at 90 days (51.7 % vs 18.3 %, P=0.001). Moderate to severe basal ganglia EPVS (OR=2.661, 95 %CI: 1.070-6.618, P=0.035), hyperlipidemia (OR=3.011, 95 %CI: 1.147-7.902, P=0.025) and a higher baseline NIHSS score before thrombolysis (OR=1.194, 95 %CI: 1.071-1.331, P=0.001) were independent risk factors for poor clinical outcome at 90 days. Early neurological improvement (OR=0.220, 95 %CI 0.093-0.520, P=0.001) was associated with a reduced risk of poor clinical outcomes at 90 days. Moderate-to-severe EPVS in basal ganglia were an independent risk factor for poor clinical outcome at 90 days in AIS patients with intravenous thrombolysis. Therefore, the severity of EPVS in the basal ganglia region can serve as an imaging marker to predict the 90-day clinical outcome of AIS patients treated with intravenous thrombolysis.",,,g200026@163.com.

Many radiomic features derived from computed tomography (CT) are sensitive to variations across scanners, reconstruction settings, and acquisition protocols. In this phantom study, eight different CT reconstruction parameters were varied to explore image- and feature-level harmonization approaches to improve tissue classification. Varying reconstructions of an anthropomorphic radiopaque phantom containing three lesion categories (metastasis, hemangioma, and benign cyst) and normal liver tissue were used for evaluating two harmonization methods and their combination: (i) generative adversarial networks (GANs) at the image level; (ii) ComBat at the feature level, and (iii) a combination of (i) and (ii). A total of 93 texture and intensity features were extracted from each tissue class before and after image-level harmonization and were also harmonized at the feature level. Reproducibility and stability were assessed via the Concordance Correlation Coefficient (CCC) and pairwise comparisons using paired stability tests. The ability of features to discriminate between tissue classes was assessed by measuring the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. The global reproducibility and discriminative power were assessed by averaging over the entire dataset and across all tissue types. ComBat improved reproducibility by 31.58% and stability by 5.24%, while GAN increased reproducibility by 8% it reduced stability by 4.33%. Classification analysis revealed that ComBat increased average AUC by 15.19%, whereas GAN decreased AUC by 2.56%. While GAN qualitatively enhances image harmonization, ComBat provides superior statistical improvements in feature stability and classification performance, highlighting the importance of robust feature-level harmonization in radiomics.",,,

Here, we examine the healthcare resource use (HCRU) and costs of aHO following treatment of these tumors. We used a retrospective matched cohort design with German statutory health insurance data on 5.42 million people from 2010 to 2021. We applied a novel three-step approach using diagnostic and prescription data to identify patients with treatment- or tumor-related (TTR)-aHO. We measured HCRU and costs across hospitalizations, outpatient visits, visits per specialist group, and outpatient prescription medications. Compared to non-HO obesity, TTR-aHO is associated with increased hospitalizations, increased outpatient physician visits, and increased prescription use in the two years after incident tumor surgery/radiotherapy. Excess costs of TTR-aHO are €19,900 per patient in the first year and €10,700 in the second, driven by inpatient costs. Cost-intensive hormone replacement therapies like somatropin lead to a sharp increase in prescription costs in the second year. This study provides the first real-world analysis of TTR-aHO economics, emphasizing the importance of HCRU and costs for decision-making. Previously, economic evaluations have been missing due to the lack of a standard method to identify patients with aHO in retrospective studies. Using a new identification approach, the study reveals that TTR-aHO poses a significant burden in extensive treatment requirements for patients and high related costs for the healthcare system.",Witte J; Touchot N; Surmann B; Braegelmann K; Flume M,Gene Access GmbH; Vandage GmbH; Rhythm Pharmaceuticals,kylie.braegelmann@vandage.de.

The aim of this study is to evaluate the relationship between equol production and the gut microbiota in school-age children, with consideration of sex, age, and exposure to soy isoflavones. Participants were 1110 students aged 7-8, 10-11 and 13-14 years. The cumulative participation rate was 85.2%. Equol production, defined as a log-transformed equol/daidzein ratio of -1.75 or greater, was determined in urine collected after two days of soymilk supplementation. Urinary daidzein, genistein, and equol were measured by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. The microbiota in 223 fecal samples was determined by 16S rRNA gene sequencing analysis. The observed operational taxonomic unit number, Chao 1, and Shannon index were significantly higher in equol producers than in non-producers after adjustments for survey time, sex, and age. Principal coordinate analysis plots based on weighted and unweighted UniFrac distances showed significant differences in the gut microbiota between equol producers and non-producers. Among the species with an average abundance of ≥0.1%, several species were more abundant in equol producers than in non-producers, with significant positive correlations between relative abundances and equol/daidzein ratios. Of species previously reported as equol-producing, Asaccharobacter celatus and Slackia isoflavoniconvertens were significantly associated with equol production. Equol production was strongly associated with the diversity of the gut microbiota.

Recent advancements in research techniques, including manual and automated patch clamp (APC) electrophysiology, solid-supported membrane-based electrophysiology (SSME), and fluorescence-based ion imaging, have further enhanced our ability to investigate lysosomal ion channels and transporters in both physiological and pathological conditions, spurring drug discovery efforts. Several pharmaceutical companies are now developing therapies aimed at modulating these channels and transporters to improve lysosomal function in disease. Small molecules targeting channels like transient receptor potential mucolipin (TRPML) 1 and TMEM175, as well as drugs modulating lysosomal pH, are currently in preclinical and clinical development. This review provides an overview of the role of lysosomal ion channels and transporters in health and disease, highlights the cutting-edge techniques used to study them, and discusses the therapeutic potential of targeting these channels and transporters in the treatment of various diseases.

The newly developed PREVENT equations offers several advantages for short and long-term cardiovascular risk prediction. To determine how often PREVENT equations identify increased cardiovascular risk among young adults who experience premature myocardial infarction compared with existing risk calculators. The YOUNG-MI registry is a retrospective cohort from two large academic centers, which included individuals who experienced an MI at age ≤ 50 years. Study physicians adjudicated diagnosis of Type 1 MI. Cardiovascular risk was estimated by pooled cohort equations and PREVENT equations based on data available prior to MI or at the time of presentation. The study cohort included 1149 individuals with a median age of 45 years and 19 % women. The median 10-year ASCVD risk calculated by pooled cohort equations and 2023 PREVENT equations was 4.6 % and 2.3 %, respectively. Using the 10-year ASCVD risk estimates from the 2023 PREVENT equations, only 33 (3 %) individuals met the 7.5 % threshold while 93 (8 %) met the 5 % threshold and 333 (29 %) met the 3 % threshold. For 30-year ASCVD risk using PREVENT, 827 (72 %) met a threshold of ≥ 10 %. The PREVENT equations may lead to undertreatment of young adults who experienced an MI.

Therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) refers to the measurement of clozapine concentration. Clozapine TDM can be used to optimize treatment, particularly by identifying pharmacokinetic interactions between clozapine and comedications. We identified 5 cases of patients with available clozapine concentrations who were concomitantly receiving nifedipine and clozapine. These cases were drawn from 2 independent datasets: 2 from a double-blind, randomized clinical trial in the United States and 3 from a German TDM naturalistic database. As an index of clozapine clearance, we used the trough-level concentration-to-dose (C/D) ratios to estimate the minimum therapeutic doses. To estimate dose-correction factors for nifedipine treatment, we included only clozapine concentrations at steady state. We divided the clozapine minimum therapeutic doses (MTD) from the on-condition by the off-nifedipine condition. In 4 patients, the ratio of on/off nifedipine for MTD ranged between 0.58 and 0.82. Another patient had no data and had to be compared with published control data (female smoker of African ancestry), providing a correction factor of 0.52 after eliminating 5 concentrations contaminated by the development of obesity. In the absence of access to TDM, when prescribing nifedipine to clozapine-treated patients, we recommend reducing the daily dose of clozapine by one-third because of the weak inhibition of clozapine metabolism. With access to TDM, TDM should guide dosing as unusual patients may need larger dose reductions, as it is possible that in some patients, nifedipine may be a moderate inhibitor requiring halving clozapine dose. Further prospective studies are warranted.",Paulzen M,Alexianer Centre for Mental Health Aachen/Gangelt.,

Although this combination is highly effective, acquired resistance commonly occurs. MCL-1, a BCL-2 family molecule, is frequently upregulated in VEN-resistant cells, playing a major role in VEN resistance. Previously, we demonstrated that (R)-WAC-224 is effective against AML with minimal cardiac toxicity. (R)-WAC-224 combined with VEN demonstrated strong antileukemia effects on VEN-resistant AML cells overexpressing MCL-1 in vitro. Gene expression profiles revealed that (R)-WAC-224 with VEN induced DNA damage pathways leading to cell apoptosis. (R)-WAC-224 elicited caspase 3 activation, which cleaved MCL-1; this effect was reversed by a caspase inhibitor, thus overcoming VEN resistance. A combination of azacitidine (AZA), a hypomethylating agent, VEN, and (R)-WAC-224 was highly effective against VEN-resistant AML in vivo without increasing toxicity.

We hypothesized that baseline and early-on-treatment (EOT) parameters may help identify patients likely to have primary refractory disease. We considered baseline and EOT variables measured up to 5 weeks after initiating therapy in the phase 3 clinical trial IMvigor211, which compared atezolizumab versus chemotherapy, in muC patients who had progressed on platinum-based chemotherapy. We used least absolute shrinkage and selection operator-regularized logistic regression models to predict the risk of primary refractory disease employing clinical and laboratory variables. 902 patients were evaluable for analysis. Our baseline model achieves an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.730, 0.717 for the atezolizumab group and 0.696 for the chemotherapy group. The AUC increases to 0.848 overall with EOT parameters, 0.871 for the atezolizumab group and 0.788 for the chemotherapy group. The EOT model suggests that 33.7% of patients receiving atezolizumab may benefit from switching to chemotherapy, reducing their risk of primary refractoriness from 67.1% to 51.5%. Our prediction model employs readily available and routinely measured clinical and laboratory factors, such as urine-specific gravity, presence of liver metastases, and total protein and erythrocyte counts. It robustly identifies patients with early primary refractory disease to atezolizumab before clinical progression and may inform therapeutic decisions.

Although there have been significant advances in RA treatment over the past two decades, approximately 40% of patients do not respond to first-line biological disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (bDMARDs). Physicians often use an empirical, trial-and-error approach to select bDMARDs to treat patients with RA. This is inefficient and can be costly for healthcare systems which have limited resources. Unlike in oncology, where molecular pathology helps guide targeted therapies, reliable, predictive biomarkers for drug response in RA are yet to be identified. This narrative review aims to summarise current knowledge on novel biomarkers of disease activity and drug response in RA, with a particular focus on serum cytokine profiles and macrophage and fibroblast subsets in synovial tissue. We also highlight key areas of further research that could advance the development of targeted therapies for patients with RA. We searched PubMed to identify studies pertaining to biomarkers of disease activity and drug response in the treatment of RA. We present a detailed overview of the key studies that have identified serum cytokine profiles and synovial macrophage and fibroblast subsets as novel biomarkers of disease activity and drug response in RA. A novel, evidence-based approach to precision medicine in RA, which involves tailoring treatment based on cytokine profiles and synovial tissue signatures, shows promise for improving patient care. However, more research is needed to identify biomarkers that predict drug response.",Avouac J,Service de Rhumatologie,jerome.avouac@aphp.fr.
40338870,"The effect of supply chain risks management practices on operational performance of pharmaceutical manufacturing companies in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia: Analytical cross-sectional study.",2025-05-08,PloS one,10.1371/journal.pone.0321311,"The efficient movement of pharmaceuticals through various stakeholders to reach customers in the appropriate quantity and at the right time is achieved through supply chain management. However, the intricate nature of supply chain processes poses tremendous supply chain risks and jeopardizing pharmaceutical manufacturing company's ability. Failure to address these risks can hinder the provision of high-quality health services. However, effective supply chain risk management can foster more resilient and efficient global supply chains. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the effect of pharmaceutical supply chain risks management practices on operational performance of pharmaceutical manufacturing companies in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. Analytical cross-sectional study complemented with qualitative method was conducted at pharmaceutical manufacturing companies in Addis Ababa between May-August 2023. One hundred seventy two staffs working in four manufacturing companies included in the study. For quantitative part, pretested a self-administered five-point Likert scale questionnaire was used and analyzed using SPSS® -version 26. Assumptions of linear multivariate regression were checked and the level of significance determined at a 95% CI and p-value <0.05. Nine face to face in-depth interviews with key informants were conducted to gather the qualitative data, and the data were analyzed using thematic analysis technique. The study included 172 employees from four manufacturing companies, with a response rate of 97%. The regression analysis revealed that demand (β=-0.191, t = -4.162, p < 0.05) and supply side risks (β=-0.131, t = -2.015, p < 0.05) have a negative effect on the operational performance of manufacturing companies. Holding other variables constant, a one-unit increase in demand and supply side risks results in 19.1% and 13.1% lead to decrease in operational performance of manufacturing companies, respectively. Increasing costs of freight, shortage and fluctuating foreign exchange rate for currency, lack of logistics expertise and organized risks mitigation team were the major challenges for manufacturing company's operational performance. Demand and supply side risks affected the supply chain performance of the manufacturing companies. Furthermore, the increasing costs of freight, shortage of foreign currency, lack of logistics expertise and organized risk mitigation team were the main bottleneck for pharmaceutical manufacturing company's performance. The study result suggests demand and supply side risks, increasing costs of freight; shortage foreign currency exchange rate and lack of logistics expertise in companies should be given attention by stakeholders to improve operational performance. Furthermore, understanding these risk factors can improve the operational performance of the pharmaceutical industry by influencing policy and industry practices in the larger framework of global supply chain risk management not only one country.",,,

A descriptive design was used. Initially, pre education questionnaires were distributed to nurses in the preoperative unit during a monthly department meeting to assess their existing knowledge. This was followed by an educational presentation detailing the effects of preoperative anxiety on surgical outcomes, its manifestations in patients, and various anxiety assessment tools. Subsequently, two post education questionnaires were administered at different intervals to gauge the improvement in knowledge and the effectiveness of the educational intervention. The project identified a significant knowledge gap among preoperative nurses regarding the tools and standardization needed for effective anxiety assessment. The educational intervention successfully enhanced nurses' understanding and assessment practices related to preoperative anxiety. This project highlighted the importance of proper anxiety assessment in the preoperative period and provided a foundation for potential practice changes aimed at improving patients' surgical experiences through better management of preoperative anxiety.",,,nmasdalessandro@metrohealth.org.
40338447,The curse of blood-brain barrier and blood-tumor barrier in malignant brain tumor treatment.,,International journal of clinical oncology,10.1007/s10147-025-02777-3,"The blood-brain barrier (BBB) is crucial for brain homeostasis but is a major obstacle in delivering anticancer drugs to brain tumors. However, this perspective requires re-evaluation, particularly for malignant brain tumors, such as gliomas and brain metastases. In these aggressive tumors, the BBB undergoes significant alterations, leading to the formation of a more permeable blood-tumor barrier. While this increased permeability allows better drug penetration, heterogeneity in blood-tumor barrier (BTB) integrity across different tumor regions remains a challenge. Additionally, the main challenge in treating brain tumors lies not in BBB penetration but in the lack of effective drugs. Conventional chemotherapies, including temozolomide and nitrosourea agents, have shown limited efficacy, and resistance mechanisms often reduce their long-term benefits. The ""BBB curse"" has often been blamed for the slow progress in drug development. However, emerging evidence suggests that even larger-molecule therapies, such as antibody-drug conjugates, can successfully target brain tumors. This review aims to critically reassess the roles of the BBB and BTB in brain tumor therapy, highlighting their impact on drug delivery and evaluating the current landscape of chemotherapeutic strategies. Furthermore, it explores new approaches to overcome treatment limitations, emphasizing the need for personalized and targeted therapeutic strategies.",,,yonarita@ncc.go.jp.

The Government of China has introduced the National Drug Price Negotiation (NDPN) policy to mitigate the high costs of anticancer drugs, especially multi-indication drugs, aimed at improving patient access to effective treatments. In this retrospective study, we examined 24 multi-indication anticancer drugs for solid tumours included in the National Reimbursement Drug List (NRDL) between 2016 and 2023. We collected characteristics of indication, clinical trial evidence, and clinical benefits of these drugs, calculated monthly drug costs, and assessed the associations the two by regression and correlation analyses. We observed a significant reduction in the median monthly drug cost from USD 3863.08 before NDPN to USD 732.91 after their inclusion in the NRDL. However, the correlation analyses showed no significant relationships between drug costs and characteristics of indications, clinical trial evidence, and clinical benefits, while American Society of Clinical Oncology Value Framework scores demonstrated a negative correlation with costs, indicating that pricing may not accurately reflect clinical benefits. While we found that the NDPN policy has significantly reduced drug costs, we did not observe a significant correlation between costs and specific characteristics. This highlights a need for a more transparent pricing mechanism linked to clinical efficacy to improve the accessibility and affordability of cancer therapies that effectively balance the interests of pharmaceutical companies, patients, and health insurance funds.",,,
40338322,New drugs and their performance 10 years after approval: a systematic analysis.,,Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's archives of pharmacology,10.1007/s00210-025-04178-9,"More than 10,000 drugs are available on today's market in Germany, with an increasing number receiving institutional approval every year. However, their general efficacy and utility for patients are often not thoroughly analyzed and, in some cases, remain questionable. The lack of systematic analysis for these parameters hinders learning from failures and successes. As a result, there is a risk of wasting resources by the pharmaceutical industry and approving new drugs that offer no additional benefit to patients in need of innovative treatments. Therefore, we set out to analyze the evolution of new drugs with innovative principles over 10 years after approval by the European Medicines Agency (EMA). We focused on drugs approved from 2004 to 2011, excluding protein kinase inhibitors and monoclonal antibodies, and identified 190 new drugs using the Arzneiverordnungsreport (AVR, Drug prescription report). With data from the Wissenschaftliches Institut der Ortskrankenkassen (WidO, Scientific Institute of the General Local Health Insurance Fund, AOK), we analyzed their number of prescriptions, sales, defined daily doses (DDD), and daily costs. We then extended our analysis with a focus on Rote-Hand-Briefe (RHB, Direct Healthcare Professional Communication). We identified factors of success, which was defined as a drug appearing in the top 3000. We then conducted a detailed analysis of outliers in terms of sales, focusing on parameters such as indications, innovation regarding their mechanism of action, relative costs, competition, pharmacological properties, and clinical studies. The analysis of both the most and least successful, allowed us to identify clear correlations and determine potential red flags as well as green flags regarding pharmaceutical sales. Nearly half (49%) of the drugs analyzed met our success criterion, most very early (66% within the first 2 years). Most of these drugs also showed a notable progression in the drug rankings over the years. Thirty percent of all analyzed drugs received RHBs, with most of them (84% of the said 30%) receiving at least one deemed potentially influential regarding sales. The successful drugs were more often subject to these potentially influential RHBs than their non-successful counterparts, and most of the potentially influential RHBs were related to adverse drug reactions (53%) or indications or contraindications (14.8%). Based on the analysis of the tops and flops, we conclude that market success, measured by sales, is influenced by multiple factors. These include indication(s), innovation, the competitive landscape, costs, and pharmacological aspects as well as studies regarding the efficacy and the adverse drug reactions of the drug. These results underline the necessity of a multifactorial approach based on value-adding to assess potential new drugs by pharmaceutical companies.",,,seifert.roland@mh-hannover.de.

Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the most common type; most cases are advanced/metastatic at diagnosis. Available first and second lines of treatment include platinum-based chemotherapeutics, therapies targeting driver oncogene mutations, and immune checkpoint inhibitors, with limited options at later lines. Understanding the current treatment landscape to define unmet needs will benefit research and development of novel therapies for advanced/metastatic NSCLC. The LUMINATE-101 retrospective cohort study evaluated real-world treatment patterns and outcomes for patients with non-squamous epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) wild type (WT) advanced/metastatic NSCLC diagnosed 1 January 2017 to 31 August 2022 that progressed on previous therapies. Patient data were pooled from US-based electronic health records-derived databases: Flatiron Health NSCLC real-world, ConcertAI Patient360 Lung Cancer, and ConcertAI RWD360NLP; redundant records were removed using tokenization. Overall, 620 patients were included; median age 67 years, >34% ECOG performance status ≥2, 19% had brain metastasis, 10% had liver metastasis, and 91% were current/ex-smokers.

This study aimed to investigate the complementary effects of combination therapy with pioglitazone (PIO) and empagliflozin (EMPA) on MASLD in individuals with type 2 diabetes. In a randomized, open-label trial, 50 participants with type 2 diabetes and MASLD were assigned 1:1:1 to receive PIO 15 mg, EMPA 10 mg, or a combination (PIO 15 mg plus EMPA 10 mg) daily for 24 weeks. Liver fat fraction and stiffness were evaluated using magnetic resonance imaging-proton density fat fraction (MRI-PDFF) and magnetic resonance elastography (MRE), respectively. Combination therapy resulted in the largest reduction in liver fat and stiffness among treatment groups. Participants experiencing a relative reduction ≥ 30% or an absolute reduction ≥ 5% in liver fat were the most prevalent in the combination group (100.0% vs. 57.1% in PIO and 87.5% in EMPA, p = 0.010). In addition, the combination group showed the highest proportion of individuals with a relative reduction ≥ 30% in liver fat and ≥ 20% in liver stiffness than the monotherapy groups (50.0% vs. 21.4% in PIO and 6.3% in EMPA, p = 0.029). Combination therapy did not induce the changes in subcutaneous fat deposition observed in the monotherapy groups, but it did show the most substantial reduction in visceral fat, concurrently showing the largest increase in adiponectin level across the three groups (p = 0.036). Combination therapy of PIO with EMPA showed synergistic benefits for MASLD in individuals with type 2 diabetes, compensating for the inadequate or unfavorable effects of monotherapies; ClincialTrials.gov number, NCT03646292.

This analysis of the cross-sectional, population-based, nationwide online survey included adults with migraine. Respondents reported their experiences with prescription and OTC drugs for migraine, migraine-specific drug awareness, and attitude towards migraine. Subgroup analyses were performed based on the number of monthly headache days (MHD) and the frequency of OTC drug use/month. The 19,590 respondents with migraine (68.8% female; mean [SD] age 40.5 [13.1] years) had mean (SD) 3.5 (5.2) MHDs; 29.0% consulted doctors in the past year for migraine. OTC drug use in the past year was common (≥ 62.1%) regardless of doctor consultation or number of MHDs. Among respondents who answered that they would usually use prescribed drugs when they have a migraine attack, 35.2% reported that they would typically use OTC drugs too. The frequency of OTC drug use was the same or higher than that of prescribed drugs in 51.3% of the respondents who consulted doctors in the past year. Only 14.6% of respondents discussed OTC drugs with doctors during consultations in the past year. Migraine-specific drug access and awareness were limited even among frequent OTC drug users (≥ 10 days/month); 18.2% used triptans, but 65.5% never heard of it. Among 37.1% of respondents who had hesitated to visit a doctor, 'I could handle it myself with OTC medicine' was the most common reason for hesitation (34.9%). OTC drug use is common among people with migraine; however, it is not frequently discussed with doctors. Many respondents, even those with frequent OTC drug use, did not have access or awareness of migraine-specific drugs.

However, it is crucial to understand these effects to interpret the results of cross-sectional and longitudinal studies in medicated patients and, ultimately, to understand better the biological mechanisms driving antipsychotics' effects. In this work, we aim to determine whether exposure to antipsychotics is associated with alterations in brain MRI structural metrics in the absence of disease effects. A randomized, double-blind, counter-balanced order, crossover, placebo-controlled study in healthy volunteers was performed. The study comprised two arms. Within arms, participants were randomized to receive daily doses of either the active compound (Arm 1= amisulpride 400 mg/day, N = 24; Arm 2= aripiprazole 10 mg/day, N = 24) for one week, followed by placebo or vice versa. We found increased MRI volume estimates in the left putamen and in the right caudate in the amisulpride condition as compared to placebo and increased right putamen volume estimates after aripiprazole compared to placebo. No other effects were found in cortical volume estimates, cortical thickness, cortical surface area, and T1-relaxation time. Striatal changes reversed within weeks of drug withdrawal. Short-term exposure to either one of two different antipsychotics results in a transient increase in striatal volume measured with T1-weighted MRI that normalizes rapidly on stopping treatment without cortical changes. Our findings suggest that striatal volumetric MRI differences detected in people with schizophrenia taking antipsychotics are, at least in part, attributable to pharmacological effects.",Wall MB,Invicro,pierluigi.selvaggi@kcl.ac.uk.

TYK2 missense mutations protect against type 1 diabetes (T1D), and inhibition of TYK2 shows promise in other autoimmune conditions. We evaluated the effects of specific TYK2 inhibitors (TYK2is) in pre-clinical models of T1D, including human β cells, cadaveric islets, iPSC-derived islets, and mouse models. In vitro studies showed that TYK2is prevented IFNα-induced β cell HLA class I up-regulation, endoplasmic reticulum stress, and chemokine production. In co-culture studies, pre-treatment of β cells with TYK2i prevented IFNα-induced antigenic peptide presentation and alloreactive and autoreactive T cell degranulation. In vivo administration of BMS-986202 in two mouse models of T1D (RIP-LCMV-GP and NOD mice) reduced systemic and tissue-localised inflammation, prevented β cell death, and delayed T1D onset. Transcriptional phenotyping of pancreatic islets, pancreatic lymph nodes, and spleen highlighted a role for TYK2 inhibition in modulating signalling pathways associated with inflammation, translational control, stress signalling, secretory function, immunity, and diabetes. Additionally, TYK2i treatment changed the composition of innate and adaptive immune cell populations in the blood and disease target tissues. These findings indicate that TYK2i has beneficial effects on both the immune and endocrine compartments in models of T1D, thus supporting a path forward for testing TYK2is in human T1D.

While naked exRNAs can be spontaneously internalized by certain cells, functional cytosolic delivery has been rarely observed. Here, we show that extracellular ribonucleases (RNases)-primarily from cell culture supplements-have obscured the study of exRNA functionality. When ribonuclease inhibitor (RI) is added to cell cultures, naked exRNAs can trigger pro-inflammatory responses in dendritic cells and macrophages, largely via endosomal Toll-like receptors (TLRs). Moreover, naked exRNAs can escape endosomes, engaging cytosolic RNA sensors. In addition, naked extracellular mRNAs can be spontaneously internalized and translated by various cell types in an RI-dependent manner. In vivo, RI co-injection amplifies naked-RNA-induced activation of splenic lymphocytes and myeloid leukocytes. Furthermore, naked RNA is inherently pro-inflammatory in RNase-poor compartments like the peritoneal cavity. These findings demonstrate that naked RNA is bioactive without requiring vesicular encapsulation, making a case for nonvesicular-exRNA-mediated intercellular communication.",,,msegovia@pasteur.edu.uy.

More recently, GBA1 mutations have been identified as the most prevalent genetic risk factor for Parkinson's disease (PD), associated with more pronounced symptoms characterized by earlier onset and accelerated cognitive decline. In these GBA-associated PD patients the α-synuclein pathology is more prominent, and recent data suggest a link between α-synucleinopathies and GBA1 mutations. Here, we explored the effect of GBA1 gene supplementation on the GD phenotypes and α-synuclein pathology by using the adeno-associated virus (AAV) system. We have compared two AAV serotypes, AAV5 and AAV9, and two different ubiquitous promoters, and demonstrate that both promoters work efficiently albeit not the same in vitro and in vivo. GBA1 overexpression reduces the accumulation of glucosylsphingosine (GlcSph) and restores motor dysfunction in a GD mouse model. We further demonstrate that GBA1 overexpression can dissolve phospho-α-synuclein aggregation induced by the addition of α-synuclein pre-formed fibril (PFF) in a mouse primary neuron model suggesting the direct effect of β-Glucocerebrosidase (GCase) on α-synuclein accumulation. In vivo, we show that GCase inhibition can induce insoluble high-molecular-weight α-synuclein aggregation and that delivery of GBA1 achieves robust reduction of the α-synuclein aggregates in the mouse brain. In summary, GCase expression not only reduces GlcSph, but also restores GD motor dysfunction and removes α-synuclein aggregates which are the hallmark for PD and α-synucleinopathies. AAV delivery of GBA1 is a powerful approach to restore glucocerebrosidase function and to resolve misfolded α-synuclein protein, with applications for GD and PD.",Okai T; Hioki T; Tanaka M,Neuroscience Drug Discovery Unit,

This systematic review covers the literature between 2013 and 16 November 2024 in the Scopus, Web of Science, IEEE Xplore, and Wiley databases, focusing on carbon-based sensor materials, structural design, and fabrication technologies that contribute to maximizing the sensor performance and scalability with particular emphasis on food and pharmaceutical product packaging applications. After being subjected to the inclusion and exclusion criteria, 164 studies were included in this review. The results show that most humidity sensors are made using graphene oxide (GO), though there is some progress toward cellulose and cellulose-based materials. Graphene and carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are predominant in temperature and mechanical sensors. The application of composites with structural design (e.g., porous and 3D structures) significantly improves sensitivity, long-term stability, and multifunctionality, whereas manufacturing methods such as spray coating and 3D printing further drive production scalability. The transition from metal to carbon-based electrodes could also reduce the cost. However, the scalability, long-term stability, and real-world validation remain challenges to be addressed. Future research should further enhance the performance and scalability of carbon-based sensors through low-energy fabrication techniques and the development of sustainable advanced materials to provide solutions for practical applications in dynamic transportation environments.",Stoeva Z,DZP Technologies Limited,

40332747,Amylin: From Mode of Action to Future Clinical Potential in Diabetes and Obesity.,,"Diabetes therapy : research, treatment and education of diabetes and related disorders",10.1007/s13300-025-01733-8,"Precision diabetology is increasingly becoming diabetes phenotype-driven, whereby the specific hormonal imbalances involved are taken into consideration. Concomitantly, body weight-favorable therapeutic approaches are being dictated by the obesity pandemic, which extends to all diabetes subpopulations. Amylin, an anorexic neuroendocrine hormone co-secreted with insulin, is deficient in individuals with diabetes and plays an important role in postprandial glucose homeostasis, with additional potential cardiovascular and neuroprotective functions. Its actions include suppressing glucagon secretion, delaying gastric emptying, increasing energy expenditure and promoting satiety. While amylin holds promise as a therapeutic agent, its translation into clinical practice is hampered by complex receptor biology, the limitations of animal models, its amyloidogenic properties and pharmacokinetic challenges. In individuals with advanced β-cell dysfunction, supplementing insulin therapy with pramlintide, the first and currently only approved injectable short-acting selective analog of amylin, has demonstrated efficacy in enhancing both postprandial and overall glycemic control in both type 2 diabetes (T2D) and type 1 diabetes (T1D) without increasing the risk of hypoglycemia or weight gain. Current research focuses on several key strategies, from enhancing amylin stability by attaching polyethylene glycol or carbohydrate molecules to amylin, to developing oral amylin formulations to improve patients' convenience, as well as developing various combination therapies to enhance weight loss and glucose regulation by targeting multiple receptors in metabolic pathways. The novel synergistically acting glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist combined with the amylin agonist, CagriSema, shows promising results in both glucose regulation and weight management. As such, amylin agonists (combined with other members of the incretin class) could represent the elusive drug candidate to address the multi-hormonal dysregulations of diabetes subtypes and qualify as a precision medicine approach that surpasses the long overdue division into T1DM and T2DM. Further development of amylin-based therapies or delivery systems is crucial to fully unlock the therapeutic potential of this intriguing hormone.Graphical abstract available for this article. Diabetes is a chronic disease with many faces, and persons affected by diabetes are continuously confronted with challenges, with injecting insulin and fighting obesity being the most recent. Current research is focused on designing drug candidates that would simultaneously address different mechanisms of high glucose in an individual and contribute to satiation, body weight control and patient convenience. Amylin is a hormone that is, similar to insulin, secreted by the pancreas. Its clinical use is currently limited to a single product, known as pramlintide, which is approved as an adjunct therapy in persons with insulin-treated diabetes. While the use of amylin is efficient, patients have to inject it with each meal and in a separate injection from insulin. Consequently, improving amylin-based medicines focuses on enabling longer action, resulting in weekly use, possibly even oral use and, most importantly, combining the functions of more than one hormone known for being involved in glucose control and the promotion of satiety. Similarly to other medicines primarily used in persons with diabetes, amylin-based medicines might eventually be used to address different diseases of the metabolic spectrum, namely obesity and its complications.",Muzurović E,Endocrinology Section,dremir@t-com.me.

40332665,Societal Versus Healthcare Perspectives on the Cost Effectiveness of Ocrelizumab for Treatment of Primary Progressive Multiple Sclerosis in Aotearoa New Zealand.,,PharmacoEconomics,10.1007/s40273-025-01486-z,"Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a progressive, degenerative, autoimmune neuronal disease. This study compares the impact of a societal versus a healthcare perspective on the cost effectiveness of treatment of primary progressive MS (PPMS) with ocrelizumab (OCR) versus best supportive care (BSC) in New Zealand. The analysis utilises a lifetime cohort Markov model based on ten Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) states, plus death. It has two structurally identical arms, with forward transition probabilities in the treatment arm obtained by multiplying forward transition probabilities (converted to rates, and back to probabilities) in the control arm by the 12-week disability progression hazard ratio in the clinical trial ORATORIO. Direct and indirect costs of MS were estimated from a 2017 Australian survey and converted to 2024 NZ dollars using purchasing power parity and the NZ consumer price index. Future costs and benefits were discounted at 3.5% per annum. The model is calibrated to NZ mortality for PPMS, and therapy ends when wheelchair dependence (EDSS7) is reached. For a modelled cohort 40 years of age starting at the ORATORIO distribution of EDSS, at 50% of the list price (viz. 50% rebate on $NZ37,384 per patient per annum), the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of OCR versus BSC is $NZ114,427 per QALY ($US64,651) from a societal perspective or $NZ146,711 ($US82,892) from a healthcare perspective. From a societal perspective, at Treasury's willingness to pay (WTP) criterion of $NZ120,200, an acquisition cost up to 56% of list price ($NZ20,935; 44% rebate) is justifiable. From a healthcare payer perspective, at Treasury's implied WTP of $NZ43,313, an acquisition cost up to 10% of list price ($NZ3738; 90% rebate) is justifiable. Based on this metric, a 5.6-fold higher investment in OCR can be justified from a societal perspective compared with a healthcare perspective. Alternatively, an acquisition cost up to 37.9% of list price (viz. 62.1% rebate or $NZ14,169) could be justified if the criterion of one GDP per capita ($NZ83,011) is used as a societal funding threshold. These results are sensitive to the cost of BSC from a societal perspective but not from a healthcare perspective. From both perspectives the cost effectiveness is sensitive to the acquisition cost and efficacy of OCR, potential waning of efficacy, the age and EDSS state when therapy begins, the cost and timing of entry of a biosimilar pharmaceutical and the discount rate. Treatment of PPMS with OCR is more cost effective from a societal than a healthcare perspective, therefore prioritisation of public funding of novel pharmaceuticals for MS and other resource intensive chronic health conditions will depend critically upon the study perspective.",Milne RJ; Schousboe C,Roche Singapore Pte Ltd; Health Outcomes Associates Ltd,richard.milne@hoa.co.nz.

While pharmacological mechanisms suggest that ACEIs may provide better cardiovascular protection than ARBs, this potential benefit has not been fully established in previous observational studies of patients with diabetes. An active-comparator new-user design within target trial emulation framework was implemented using Yinzhou Regional Health Care Database (YRHCD). We compared risks of major cardiovascular events (MACE) between older patients (age ≥ 65 years) with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) newly exposed to ACEIs and ARBs from January 1, 2010 to May 31, 2023. The primary outcomes were 3-point MACE, including hospitalized myocardial infarction, hospitalized stroke, and all-cause mortality (a proxy for cardiovascular mortality). We also assessed 4-point MACE, which further included hospitalized heart failure. Propensity scores were calculated to balance 44 identified confounders. Marginal structure models were applied to estimate per-protocol hazard ratios. A total of 18,558 individuals were included, with 1,641 initiating ACEIs and 16,917 initiating ARBs. Their median age was 72 years and 45% were male. The adjusted hazard ratio for ACEIs vs. ARBs was 0.86 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.68-1.10) for 3-point MACE and 0.83 (95% CI 0.69-0.99) for 4-point MACE. The 1-year absolute risk differences were - 0.30% (95% CI - 1.80-1.21%) for 3-point MACE and - 1.16% (95% CI - 2.97-0.66%) for 4-point MACE. Results were consistent across subgroup analyses (stratified by age, sex, as well as baseline major atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, heart failure, other antihypertensive therapy, insulin therapy, and calendar year) and sensitivity analyses. Among older patients with T2DM, the initiation of ACEIs was associated with a trend toward lower risk of MACE compared to ARBs, implying the potential cardiovascular benefits of ACEIs in this population.",,,xuyang_pucri@bjmu.edu.cn.

It includes recall periods of 24 h for symptoms and 7 days for impacts. The PAH-SYMPACT for use in Clinical Practice (SYMPACT-CP) is an adaptation of the PAH-SYMPACT in which the recall period for symptoms has been revised to 7 days, a timeframe more appropriate for clinical practice settings. The PAH-SYMPACT was psychometrically validated previously. As such, this study focused on assessing whether patients with PAH can use the SYMPACT-CP appropriately to rate their symptoms over the 7-day range, and it explored their perspectives on the utility and feasibility of completing the questionnaire as part of routine clinical assessments. This was a cross-sectional, noninterventional, qualitative study involving one-on-one telephone interviews with English-speaking adults (≥ 18 years) living in the US diagnosed with PAH. Participants were provided copies of the SYMPACT-CP to review, and interviews were subsequently conducted using a semi-structured guide including concept elicitation and cognitive interviewing sections. Transcripts were coded using a coding framework based on the interview guide. Fifteen participants were interviewed (mean age, 49.9 years; n = 13 female, n = 13 White). Most (n = 12) stated that they thought about the last 7 calendar days or the ""last week"" when asked to interpret the 7-day recall period and all but one (n = 14) could easily remember their symptoms over this period.

Domains nominated by TRM-SLE Taskforce members were rated in a two-stage modified Delphi study. Each stage comprised two online survey rounds separated by a structured discussion meeting. In Stage 1, expert lupus clinicians and patient representatives rated domain 'importance' (impact on symptoms, function or survival). In Stage 2, clinicians rated 'important' domains on three characteristics relevant to RCT utility: 'appropriateness' for evaluating change in disease activity, 'representation' in patients with active SLE and 'measurability' in an RCT context. Consensus for domain inclusion was prespecified as all four characteristics achieving a rating ≥7 on a 1-9 scale by ≥70% of participants. Domain nominations from 36/59 (61%) TRM-SLE Taskforce members yielded 34 potential domains which were rated in the modified Delphi study. At least one Delphi round was completed by 87 clinicians and 13 patient representatives. In Stage 1, 14 domains met consensus on 'importance' in both clinician and patient groups, and 11 domains met consensus among patients only. After Stage 2, eight of these domains also reached consensus on 'appropriateness', 'representation' and 'measurability': alopecia, arthritis, haemolytic anaemia, nephritis, mucosal ulcers, rash, serositis and thrombocytopenia.

However, the steep cost of targeted therapy poses significant financial burden for individuals and health systems. We aimed to determine the trends in Medicare and Medicaid spending on CFTR modulators between the years 2015 and 2022 through retrospective analysis of the Medicare and Medicaid claims data. The outcome measures included total dosage units prescribed, number of claims, spending per claim, and total spending on CFTR modulators for Medicare and Medicaid between 2015 to 2022. Average annual percentage changes (AAPC) were calculated for all outcome measures. Our results show that from 2015 to 2022, Medicaid consistently had higher total dosage units prescribed, number of claims, spending per claim, and overall spending on CFTR modulators compared to Medicare. Total spending for both Medicaid [AAPC 38.9, 95 % confidence interval [CI] 27.2-51.6, p < 0.01] and Medicare [AAPC 39.2, 95 % CI 30.2-55.1, p < 0.01] increased significantly during this period. Increases in CFTR spending was accelerated beginning in 2019, when the triple combination CFTR modulator therapy, elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor, was introduced to the US market. This increase has been accompanied by a reduction in spending and use of other CFTR agents. This study evaluated the increases in spending for CFTR modulators over the years and the main drivers behind them, which may help inform future negotiations between healthcare systems and pharmaceutical companies, as well as policy makers and stakeholders.",,,secongly@ucalgary.ca.

The introduction of EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) has fundamentally changed the treatment landscape for such patients by improving both progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). Among EGFR-TKIs, third-generation agents such as osimertinib have shown marked efficacy and favorable safety profiles and have become the standard of care in the first-line setting. The combination of osimertinib with platinum-based chemotherapy has recently been shown to improve PFS compared with osimertinib monotherapy in the FLAURA2 trial. Similarly, the MARIPOSA trial demonstrated clinical benefit of the combination of the EGFR-MET bispecific antibody, amivantamab, with the third-generation EGFR-TKI, lazertinib, further supporting the use of combination therapies as first-line treatment for EGFR-mutated NSCLC. Despite these advances, however, challenges such as brain metastases remain substantial barriers to successful treatment outcomes. Management of patients with such metastases often requires a multidisciplinary approach that integrates systemic treatment with local interventions such as radiation therapy. Finally, circulating tumor DNA has emerged as a promising biomarker for real-time monitoring of treatment response and evolution of drug resistance mechanisms. Analysis of such biomarkers can facilitate dynamic and personalized therapeutic adjustments, potentially improving outcomes. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the latest clinical evidence supporting therapeutic advances in the management of EGFR-mutated NSCLC, emphasizing the importance of tailoring treatment strategies based on tumor biology, patient-specific factors, and evolving therapeutic options.",,,hidet31@med.kindai.ac.jp.

This may perpetuate barriers to care and reduce treatment generalizability, especially in populations with elevated rates of STB, such as body dysmorphic disorder (BDD). We conducted a cohort study of randomized controlled trial (RCT) participants (N=80) who received a smartphone-based cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) treatment for BDD that allowed for most forms of past STB, except for past-month active suicidal ideation. This study had two objectives: (1) to characterize the sample's lifetime prevalence of STB and (2) to estimate and predict STB incidence during the trial. We completed secondary analyses on data from an RCT of smartphone-delivered CBT for BDD. The primary outcomes consisted of STB severity and suicide attempt assessed at baseline with the Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS) and weekly during the trial via one item from the Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology-Self Report (QIDS-SR item #12; 1043 observations). We computed descriptive statistics (n, %) and ran a series of bi- and multivariate linear regressions predicting STB incidence during the 3-month trial. At baseline, 40% of participants reported a lifetime history of active suicidal thoughts and 10% reported lifetime suicide attempts. During the 3-month trial, 42.5% reporting thinking about death or suicide via weekly assessment. No participants reported frequent or acute suicidal thoughts, plans, or attempts. Lifetime suicide attempt (odds ratio 11, 95% CI 2.14-59.14; P<.01) and lifetime severity of suicidal thoughts (odds ratio 1.76, 95% CI 1.21-2.77; P<.01) were significant bivariate predictors of death- or suicide-related thought incidence reported during the trial. Multivariate models including STB risk factor covariates (eg, age, and sexual orientation) modestly improved prediction of death- or suicide-related thoughts (eg, positive predictive value=0.91, negative predictive value=0.75, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve=0.83). Although some participants may think about death and suicide during a DMHI trial, it may be safe and feasible to include participants with most forms of past STB. Among other procedures, researchers should carefully select eligibility criteria, use frequent, ongoing, low-burden, and valid monitoring procedures, and implement risk mitigation protocols tailored to the presenting problem.",,,

A range of clinical chemical parameters were measured in 7-day toxicology studies for 86 toxins eliciting a range of organ- and mechanism-specific effects. Additionally, 21 surgical or physiological stressors were evaluated to identify physiological or metabolic responses that might confound the interpretation of observed toxicity profiles. From these studies on a total of 3473 rats measured at six pharmaceutical companies, we provide a set of 12 serum and 5 urine physical and clinical chemistry parameters. Samples were collected at 24 h, 48 h and 168 h post-dose for each animal and are presented as a downloadable database file. We also summarise the main observations based on the group response at the level of the individual toxin. We demonstrate that correlations between parameters, such as serum bilirubin and aspartate aminotransferase (AST), provide a more nuanced profile of organ-specific toxicity than consideration of individual parameters alone. In addition, we highlight the variability in the measured parameters across the dataset attributable to inter-laboratory differences, and the heterogeneity of metabolic responses to particular compounds or differences in temporal patterns of response. This clinical chemistry atlas of toxicity serves as a valuable reference tool for evaluating the potential toxicity of novel drug candidates.",Reily MD; Robertson D; Lehman-McKeeman L; Car BD; Cantor GH,Formerly Pfizer Global R&D; Formerly Bristol-Myers-Squibb Company,Jeremy.Nicholson@murdoch.edu.au.

Studies have shown that PCOS is associated with poor quality of life, anxiety, sadness, dissatisfaction with one's appearance, and sexual dysfunction. This study was conducted to determine whether a strong psycho-pathological personality is related to PCOS and whether this personality is related to the hyperandrogenic state. Anthropometric, metabolic, hormonal, clinical, and psychological characteristics were examined in 90 Bahraini women with PCOS. After confirming the diagnosis of PCOS via Rotterdam criteria, including ovarian ultrasound, each patient was evaluated via the following questionnaires: 1) the GAD-7 (General Anxiety Disorder-7) to measure the severity of anxiety; 2) the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) to confirm and measure the severity of depression; 3) the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale (BIS-11) to measure aggression; and 4) the McLean Screening Instrument to identify borderline personality disorders (MSI-BPDs). The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board. Compared to controls, PCOS patients exhibited significantly higher rates of severe depression (8% vs. 0%, p < 0.001), severe anxiety (7% vs. 0%, p < 0.001), impulsivity (BIS-11: 39.43 ± 9.69 vs. 26.64 ± 2.92, p < 0.001), and borderline personality traits (McLean: 2.41 ± 2.44 vs. 1.2 ± 0.94, p < 0.001). Metabolic comorbidities, including obesity (BMI 28.88 vs. 20.27, p < 0.001) and hypothyroidism (48% vs. 0%, p < 0.001), were prevalent in PCOS. Hyperandrogenism correlated weakly with psychiatric outcomes (all p > 0.05). Women with PCOS demonstrate markedly elevated psychiatric and medical burdens compared to healthy controls. While hyperandrogenism showed limited direct associations, metabolic dysfunction (e.g., obesity) may mediate psychiatric risk. These findings underscore the need for multidisciplinary care integrating psychological and endocrine management, particularly in populations where cultural norms exacerbate PCOS-related distress.",,,mariwan.husni@nosm.ca.
40325417,Public health impact and cost-effectiveness of introducing MenACWY vaccination strategies in Germany.,2025-05-06,BMC public health,10.1186/s12889-025-21491-3,"The invasive meningococcal disease (IMD) routine immunization recommendation in Germany is a meningococcal serogroup C (MenC) conjugate vaccine for toddlers aged 12 months with a catch-up for unimmunized up to 17 years. However, there are no recommendations for routine meningococcal serogroups A, C, W, Y (MenACWY) vaccination or for adolescent vaccinations; this differs from other European countries. This analysis aimed to understand the benefits of implementing adolescent MenACWY vaccination in Germany. A static population-cohort model evaluating IMD burden and related health outcomes (e.g., cases, cases with long-term sequelae, deaths) was developed to compare any two meningococcal vaccination strategies. We compared hypothetical vaccination strategies that included different approaches to adolescent vaccination in Germany, such as vaccinating at 13-year olds versus 16-year olds and vaccinating with MenC versus MenACWY. Additional strategies considered the benefit that could be provided by switching the current MenC vaccine recommendation in toddlers to MenACWY. All strategies that included MenACWY vaccine were effective in decreasing the number of cases, preventing mortality and offered good value for money. The greatest benefit was observed in individuals vaccinated with MenACWY at 12 months and 16 years of age (2,978 IMD cases averted; 563 IMD deaths prevented). Compared with the current strategy of MenC vaccination at 12 months of age, two-dose strategies that included MenACWY reported incremental cost-effectiveness ratios <€13,205 per quality-adjusted life year. Adolescent strategies of MenC or MenACWY vaccine at 16 years old (with no vaccination at 12 months) dominated current vaccination strategies. Adolescent vaccination at 16 years old versus 13 years old offered slightly better value for money. With recent increases in IMD cases and outbreaks occurring globally following the COVID-19 pandemic, there is a greater urgency to proactively implement a MenACWY vaccine recommendation to protect adolescents in Germany. This recommendation would provide direct protection to a group at increased risk and offer indirect protection to other population groups. Implementation of a school-based immunization program could increase vaccine uptake and overcome hurdles in adolescent vaccination.",Schley K; Janßen S; Sullivan SM; Tichy E; Findlow J,Evidera/PPD; Pfizer Limited; Pfizer Pharma GmbH,Katharina.Schley@Pfizer.com.

Variable temperature ion mobility-mass spectrometry (VT-IM-MS) can measure the effect of temperature on conformational landscapes. To delineate collision effects from structural change we report measurements using molecules with different degrees of rigidity namely: poly (L-lysine) (PLL) dendrimer, ubiquitin, β-casein and α-synuclein from 190-350 K. The CCS of PLL dendrimer varies with temperature consistent with collision theory, by contrast, the structure of each protein alters with notable restructuring at 350 K and 250 K, following predicted in vitro stability curves. At 210 K and 190 K we kinetically trap unfolding intermediates. For alpha-synuclein, the 13+ ions present two distinct conformers and VT-IM-MS measurements allow us to calculate the transition rate and activation energies of their conversion.

Over the past decade, first-, second-, and third-generation EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have substantially improved clinical outcomes, although acquired resistance inevitably emerges. In particular, the third-generation TKI osimertinib has demonstrated superior progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) compared to earlier-generation TKIs in the frontline setting, yet median OS remains approximately three years in pivotal trials. Efforts to extend disease control have led to various upfront intensification strategies, including combining EGFR TKIs with antiangiogenics or chemotherapy (e.g., the FLAURA-2 trial), and pairing novel bispecific antibodies such as amivantamab with third-generation TKIs. Upon progression on third-generation EGFR TKIs, platinum-based chemotherapy remains the standard second-line treatment, albeit with modest response rates. Emerging therapies targeting MET amplification (e.g., savolitinib plus osimertinib), leveraging antibody-drug conjugates (e.g., patritumab deruxtecan), or adding immunotherapy and antiangiogenics have shown preliminary promise in overcoming resistance. Ongoing trials are assessing optimal treatment sequencing and the use of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) to guide therapy escalation or de-escalation.

Data sources included semistructured interviews of individuals affiliated with the commercial health data industry from May 2022 to May 2023 and publicly available documents. Data were analyzed from May 2022 to May 2024. Individual semistructured interviews and relevant publicly available documents were analyzed to gain an understanding of data collection and commercialization practices in the primary care record industry. The analysis involved a continuous and iterative process of data collection and analysis, theoretical sampling, data-driven coding, and creation of theoretical concepts.

Since COPD patients are often faced with difficult decisions, an assessment was made of their desire for disease education. Our aim was to identify patients understanding of their disease and what their attitudes are towards different treatment options and whether this correlates to demographic factors. The COPD-Assessment-Test (CAT) was used to measure subjective disease burden. The COPD-Questionnaire (COPD-Q) was used to assess subjects' own knowledge of their disease. In addition, a specifically designed questionnaire was used to assess patient's subjective level of desire to be educated on COPD-specific topics. A multiple linear regression analysis was performed to identify the demographic factors associated with a greater desire for disease-specific information. 127 patients (67.2±8.8 years) were prospectively enrolled. Mean CAT score was 21.3±8.9 (95% CI:1-40). The desire for medical consultation was highly individual. In terms of vaccination, 31.5% of patients wished for more information while 34.6% wished for less. This also held true for information on long-term pharmacological therapy (29.1% vs 30.7%, respectively). Information on behaviour in case of emergencies as well as smoking cessation were wished for 38% and 42% of patients, respectively. Results of the COPD-Q showed that subjects were well-informed about specific topics (vaccination, etiology, emergency-inhaler) and less informed about long-term pharmacotherapy. In linear regression analyses, age (p=0.086), sex (p=0.906), education (p=0.833), health literacy (p=0.336) and burden of disease (p=0.296) did not influence patients´ desire for disease-specific information. Based on our cohort, COPD patients wish for more medical information related to behaviour in emergency situations and smoking cessation. The desire for education on disease-specific topics did not naturally correlate with demographic characteristics. The provision of medical information to patients remains a highly individualized and essential part of patient care.

Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is emerging as a novel non-invasive treatment for bipolar depression. We developed a home-based protocol for tDCS which has demonstrated efficacy in unipolar and bipolar depression. We sought to explore the acceptability of home-based tDCS in bipolar depression. Participants were 35 (26 women) with bipolar disorder (mean age 47.37 years, SD ± 13.78) in a current depressive episode of at least moderate severity. tDCS was provided in a bifrontal montage 2 mA for 30 minutes in sessions over 6 weeks with real-time supervision. Acceptability was assessed in a questionnaire and individual interviews, conducted at two timepoints: baseline and post treatment. Individual interviews were analysed by thematic analysis. Six main themes were found: helpfulness, side effects, burden, gratitude, ethicality and comparison to medications. The themes of gratitude and comparison with medications were novel in this group compared to unipolar depression. Themes reflected high acceptability of tDCS treatment in bipolar depression and indicated strong interest in novel treatments in this population. Qualitative analysis can provide novel insights into individual experiences, understanding barriers to treatment, and offer guidance for improving clinical treatments.

Single-arm, exploratory phase IIIb trial conducted at 12 sites in the United States. Eligible adults with rCDI received one administration of RBL consisting of one 150-mL dose of RBL, delivered via colonoscopy to the right side of the colon. The primary endpoint assessed RBL-related treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) within 8 weeks of RBL administration or until confirmed treatment failure. Secondary endpoints included treatment success (absence of CDI recurrence for 8 weeks following RBL administration), physician experience administering RBL via colonoscopy, and physician perception of participant benefit. Of 54 participants screened, 41 were enrolled and received RBL via colonoscopy; 39 participants completed the 8-week visit. Five TEAEs in four participants (9.8%) were assessed as related to RBL, all of which were gastrointestinal and mild in severity. Overall, 18 participants (43.9%) experienced 33 TEAEs within 8 weeks, most of which were of mild (25/33; 75.8%) or moderate (5/33; 15.2%) severity. No TEAEs led to intensive care unit admission or death. Overall, 39 participants (95.1%) experienced treatment success; 2 participants (4.9%) withdrew consent and had an indeterminate outcome.

This study evaluated a novel ingestible medical device (MD) for SI luminal sample collection. A monocentric interventional trial (NCT05477069) was conducted on 15 healthy subjects. Metagenomics, metabolomics and culturomics assessed the MD's effectiveness in characterizing the healthy SI microbiome and identifying potential biomarkers. The SI microbiota differed significantly from the fecal microbiota, displaying high inter-individual variability, lower species richness, and reduced alpha diversity. A combined untargeted and semi-targeted LC-MS/MS metabolomics approach identified a distinct SI metabolic footprint, with bile acids and amino acids being the most abundant classes of metabolites. Host and host/microbe-derived bile acids were particularly abundant in SI samples. The application of a fast culturomics approach to two SI samples enabled species-level characterization, resulting in the identification of 90 bacterial species, including five potential novel species.

One way to accelerate the development of pro-cognitive therapies for schizophrenia is to evaluate compounds using biomarker approaches tailored to relevant neural mechanisms. While D1/D5 receptor (D1R/D5R) agonism has been extensively studied in neuroscience, its therapeutic potential for cognitive impairment in schizophrenia remains untapped. The Translational Neuroscience & Computational Evaluation of a D1R Partial Agonist for Schizophrenia (TRANSCENDS) clinical trial tests this mechanism using a 'target engagement' approach. Multiple, double-blind doses of a D1/D5R partial agonist were administered in advance of a functional neuroimaging (fMRI) session that deployed a cognitive paradigm explicitly designed to capture a translational micro-circuit mechanism underlying spatial working memory in patients with schizophrenia. Specifically, this study will assess whether the D1R/D5R partial agonist CVL-562 induces a dose-dependent engagement of spatial working memory circuits in schizophrenia using fMRI. This design, and the use of spatial working memory neural circuits as a dependent measure, was selected on the basis of a translational and computational understanding of prefrontal micro-circuitry and a mechanistic understanding of the role of D1R/D5Rs in schizophrenia. To enhance data integration and scalability, TRANSCENDS employs an automated informatics framework for seamless neuroimaging data sharing and electronic clinical data capture. This ensures high-standards for regulatory compliance, data quality, and data sharing across sites, improving aspects of current clinical trial data management.

Retrospective cohorts of working women from the beginning to the end of pregnancy in three public hospitals and one pharmaceutical company, between 2015 and 2019. We measured the frequency and duration of absences, by age and occupational variables, and cumulative absence days, classifying work status as at work, on SL and on POR absence. Differences between groups for each variable were analysed through the Kruskal-Wallis rank test followed by Dunn's Pairwise Comparisons. Sequence analysis was used to identify pregnancy trajectories. Among 1116 pregnant workers, absence days due to SL ranged from 9.9% to 28.6% of total possible working days, from 9.2% to 38.4% due to POR, while only 3.9% did not take any absence. Nurse aides and nurses used benefits most often and for the longest duration with respect to other occupational categories (p value<0.001). Age had no statistically significant difference (p value=0.245). Three pregnancy trajectories were identified, characterised by mostly active work, active work combined with POR and active work with SL, with differences by workplace, occupation and work area (p value<0.001). The total time in days during which pregnant women were actively working ranged between 56% and 64% depending on the organisation. This study in four organisations shows a very similar pattern regarding total time absent from work during pregnancy. Women were actively working for two-thirds of their pregnancy. Of the remaining time, while in two organisations, absences were mainly due to SL, in other two were due to POR. Organisational variations in the management of pregnant women could be an explanation.

Developing highly accurate machine learning (ML) models to predict TCR-pMHC binding could significantly accelerate immunotherapy advancements. However, existing ML models for TCR-pMHC binding prediction often underperform with unseen epitopes, severely limiting their applicability. We introduce TRAP, which leverages contrastive learning to enhance model performance by aligning structural and sequence features of pMHC with TCR sequences. TRAP outperforms previous state-of-the-art models in both random and unseen epitope scenarios, achieving an AUPR of 0.84 (a 22% improvement over the second-best model) and an AUC of 0.92 in the random scenario, and an AUC of 0.75 (almost 11% higher than the second-best model) in the unseen epitope scenario. Furthermore, TRAP demonstrates a noteworthy capability to diagnose potential issues of cross-reactivity between TCRs and similar epitopes. This highly robust performance makes it a suitable tool for large-scale predictions in real-world settings. A specific case study confirmed that TRAP can discover hit TCRs with binding free energies comparable to referenced experimental results. These findings highlight TRAP's potential for practical applications and its role as a powerful tool in developing TCR-based immunotherapies.",Deng Y,CarbonSilicon AI Technology Company,kimhsieh@zju.edu.cn

This study aims to address the contribution of 17q gain to neuroblastoma malignancy. We analyzed the genetic and transcriptional landscape of 417 neuroblastoma patients across various risk groups and clinical stages using multi-omic approaches. Single-cell RNA/DNA sequencing and SNP arrays were combined to characterize genomic aberrations, while evolutionary trajectories were mapped to explore the accumulation of genetic changes in patients with neuroblastoma. Additionally, DNA and RNA sequencing were used to assess mutational burden and gene expression patterns. Our findings suggest that chromosome 17 gain is an early genetic event acquired during neuroblastoma development, correlating with the accumulation of additional chromosomal aberrations and poor prognosis. Increased segmental gains of chromosome 17q were observed during clonal evolution, relapse disease and metastasis. We identified PPM1D, a p53-inducible Ser/Thr phosphatase located on chr17q22.3, as a key player activated by segmental 17q-gain, gene-fusion, or gain-of-function somatic and germline mutations, further promoting neuroblastoma development/progression.

This study aimed to examine the therapeutic effects of FLWXF on ""Qi-Yin deficiency"" arrhythmia and elucidate the underlying mechanisms involved. The therapeutic effects of FLWXF were assessed using isoproterenol (ISO)-induced arrhythmia models and models indicative of ""Qi-Yin deficiency."" To elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying the effects of FLWXF in ""Qi-Yin deficiency"" arrhythmia, proteomics and metabolomics techniques were used for predictive analysis, which was subsequently validated through reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) and Western blotting. Our findings demonstrated that FLWXF could ameliorate electrical signal abnormalities, atypical serum indicators, and myocardial damage induced by ISO. Moreover, FLWXF effectively mitigated electrical signal irregularities and abnormal serum markers associated with ""Qi-Yin deficiency"" and exhibited therapeutic efficacy in treating ""Qi-Yin deficiency"" arrhythmia. We identified significant enrichment of dilated cardiomyopathy and adrenergic signaling pathways in cardiomyocytes through integrated proteomics and metabolomics analyses. Additionally, our study revealed that FLWXF can normalize the aberrant elevation of cyclic adenosine monophosphate levels. RT-qPCR and Western blotting assays validated that FLWXF restored the expression of genes and proteins associated with dilated cardiomyopathy and the adrenergic signaling pathway in cardiomyocytes, including ADRB1, GNAS, ADCY1, PKA, CACNA2D1, RYR2, TNNC1, TNNI3, TNNT2, TPM1, ACTC1, and MYL7.

In the current study, we examined whether the positivity offset is relevant to explaining anhedonia and liability for psychosis among individuals at clinical high-risk for psychosis (CHR) (i.e., individuals exhibiting attenuated hallucinations or delusions that cause distress and functional decline). Mathematical modeling approaches from Cacioppo's Evaluative Space Model were applied to six days of digital phenotyping data collected in daily life among 100 individuals at CHR and 57 healthy controls (CN). Participants reported levels of positive emotion, negative emotion, and arousal throughout the day via ecological momentary assessment (EMA) surveys while accelerometry was passively recorded. EMA surveys were used to calculate the positivity offset and examine associations with real-world motivated behavior. Results indicated that the positivity offset was present among individuals at CHR, but diminished compared to CN. Importantly, smaller positivity offset scores were associated with greater clinically rated anhedonia, particularly among CHR cases with comorbid mood disorder diagnoses. Findings suggest that reductions in the positivity offset are a mechanism underlying anhedonia across phases of psychotic illness and represent a novel treatment target that is relevant for the treatment of negative symptoms and prevention of psychotic disorders.",,,gstrauss@uga.edu.

All patients were classified into non-SLD, MASLD, or MetALD groups. The effect of MASLD on gallstone development was evaluated using multivariate Cox regression analysis. Age, male sex, and MASLD were identified as independent risk factors for gallstone development. MASLD was associated with a significantly higher risk of developing gallstones than non-SLD (hazard ratio [HR] 1.7112; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.4294-2.0486; p < 0.0001) and MetALD (HR 1.3516, 95% CI 1.0130-1.8033, p = 0.0406). However, the risk of MetALD did not significantly differ between the SLD and non-SLD groups. Hypertension was the only significant independent cardiometabolic risk factor for gallstone development in the MASLD group (HR 1.4350, 95% CI 1.0545-1.9528; p = 0.0216). Random forest analysis and directed acyclic graphs identified hypertension as the most important direct factor affecting gallstone development in patients with MASLD. MASLD was an independent risk factor for gallstone development, whereas MetALD presented a similar risk as non-SLD. Moderate alcohol consumption may reduce the risk of gallstone formation in patients with MASLD. Hypertension may be the most significant cardiometabolic risk factor for gallstone development in patients with MASLD.",Yoshinaga S,Medical Examination Section,
40317387,Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of Nirsevimab for the Prevention of Respiratory Syncytial Virus among Italian Infants.,,Clinical drug investigation,10.1007/s40261-025-01437-8,"Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a major global cause of childhood respiratory infections, globally linked to significant morbidity and mortality, particularly leading in hospitalizations and death among infants below 1 year of age. A cost-effectiveness analysis was conducted to estimate the economically justifiable price (EJP) of nirsevimab, a new prophylaxis strategy protecting all infants against RSV lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs), compared with a strategy consisting of palivizumab, protecting only high-risk infants and no preventive intervention for others. A static decision tree model previously published to evaluate the clinical and economic burden of RSV in Italy was used to determine the EJP of nirsevimab for the prevention of RSV medically attended lower respiratory tract infections (RSV-MA-LRTIs) in all infants experiencing their first RSV season, to become a cost-effective alternative compared with palivizumab only in high-risk infants and no preventive intervention for others. The EJP was estimated considering three different willingness-to-pay (WTP) thresholds. The National Health Service (NHS) perspective was considered in the base-case. Direct costs considered in the analysis were acquisition and administration costs of prophylaxis, costs of managing RSV infection (inpatient and outpatient care, and emergency department visits) and costs of handling complications following hospitalization per RSV event. Indirect costs were evaluated in the scenario analysis as productivity loss due to premature death for RSV infection. A discount rate of 3.0% was applied only to mid-long-term costs and outcomes. From the NHS perspective, over the first RSV season, nirsevimab in an all-infants population could be a cost-effective approach compared with palivizumab only in high-risk infants, with an EJP equal to €267, €365, and €400 considering a WTP threshold of €0, €22,000, and €30,000 per QALY saved, respectively. Considering only the palivizumab-eligible population, the model estimated that nirsevimab could be a cost-effective approach with an EJP equal to €3,467, €3,633, and €3,694 considering a WTP threshold of €0, €22,000, and €30,000 per QALY saved, respectively. A prophylaxis strategy against RSV infection targeting all infants with nirsevimab could represent a cost-effective option for both NHS and societal perspectives, and supports the implementation and the equity of RSV prevention for all infants.",Muzii B; Soudani S,Sanofi,chiara.bini@uniroma2.it.
40317371,Perinatal risk factors and disordered eating in children and adolescents.,2025-05-03,Eating and weight disorders : EWD,10.1007/s40519-025-01751-2,"Studies have reported associations between perinatal factors (obstetric and neonatal factors) and later eating disorder risk. However, previous findings have been partly conflicting. Here, we analyzed associations between perinatal factors and disordered eating in a large cohort of Finnish children and adolescents. The participants were 8- to 14-year-old children and adolescents (N = 11,357) from The Finnish Health in Teens study. Disordered eating was assessed using the Children's Eating Attitudes Test (ChEAT). Perinatal data were obtained from the Finnish Birth Registry. Perinatal variables were initially analyzed using Chi-square analyses and linear regressions. Variables associated with disordered eating (p < .10) were entered into a multinomial logistic regression model. The regression analysis was conducted both including and excluding maternal BMI, as this information was missing for > 80% of the participants. Of the participants, 56.6% reported disordered eating (ChEAT score ≥ 11) or partial disordered eating (1-10) symptoms. Including maternal BMI in the analyses (n = 1921), higher levels of disordered eating were independently associated with maternal pre-pregnancy BMI (OR 1.07, 95% CI [1.02, 1.12]), maternal smoking during pregnancy (OR 2.64, 95% CI [1.49, 4.68]), urgent or emergency cesarean birth (OR 2.16, 95% CI [1.10, 4.05]). Assisted reproduction was associated with lower levels of disordered eating (OR 0.39, 95% CI [0.20, 0.76]). The results suggest that pregnancy and childbirth are vulnerable developmental periods, associated with later eating pathology. Further studies disentangling genetic and environmental mechanisms of associations between perinatal factors and later eating pathology are needed.

40317286,"Predicting perioperative risk of persistent paraplegia from preoperative factors in patients who undergo elective, open thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm repair.",,The Journal of thoracic and cardiovascular surgery,10.1016/j.jtcvs.2025.04.001,"Spinal cord injury is a risk for patients undergoing thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm (TAAA) repair, the most substantial deficit being persistent paraplegia (PP). Adequately estimating patients' risk of PP is vital for patient counseling and postoperative risk stratification. Patients who underwent open, elective TAAA repair (1986-2024; N = 2827) at a single practice were categorized into 4 groups: those with PP (n = 68) at discharge or death, those with persistent paraparesis (n = 55) at discharge or death, those with transient paraplegia or paraparesis (n = 132), and those without any spinal cord deficit (SCD, n = 2572); 4 cohorts were created comprising combinations of these groups. Several models were evaluated, including logistic regression and machine-learning approaches, to better understand predictors of PP and other SCDs in key cohorts. Regarding prediction of PP, the gradient boosting machine was best (C = 0.79 [0.75-0.81]); however, the multivariable logistic regression model was similar (0.78 [0.74-0.81]) and was converted into a nomogram to highlight the predictive value of diabetes (odds ratio, 2.48; P = .009), previous percutaneous coronary intervention (OR, 3.04; P < .001), chronic kidney disease (OR, 2.48; P < .001), tobacco use (OR, 13.25; P = .01), symptomatic aortic disease (OR, 1.96; P = .01), and Crawford extent of TAAA repair (II: OR, 4.00; P < .001). Predictors of PP and SCD in key cohorts were similar. For patients undergoing elective, open TAAA repair, the risk of PP can be estimated from preoperative characteristics and explained by an intuitive nomogram to aid personalized preoperative counseling, with greater-risk patients prioritized perioperatively for rigorous blood pressure monitoring, increased cerebrospinal fluid drainage, or a lower threshold for transfusion.",,,jcoselli@bcm.edu.
40317073,Cephalosporin-based combination therapies for combating ESKAPE pathogens: a patent review.,2025-05-10,Journal of applied microbiology,10.1093/jambio/lxaf107,"ESKAPE (namely Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Enterobacter) pathogens pose a major threat to global health. The World Health Organization highlights the need for new antimicrobial strategies, including combination therapies, to address their resistance. Cephalosporins, due to their broad-spectrum activity and safety profile, are widely used in hospitals and serve as strong candidates for such regimens. While many studies explore cephalosporin combinations, there is a lack of systematic reviews focused on patent literature. This study analyses patent filings related to cephalosporin-based combination therapies targeting ESKAPE pathogens. The Espacenet database was thoroughly searched using the keywords ""combination,"" ""antibiotics,"" and ""cephalosporin"" yielding 666 patent applications filed up to June 2024. Based on the inclusion criteria, 30 patents were selected for further analysis. Notably, most patents were filed in China and the USA, accounting for up to 30% and 17%, respectively. Most patents were filed by private companies and classified under the International Patent Classification code A61K, indicating their pharmaceutical applications. Additionally, in 2022, the highest number of patents were filed in this area. However, clinical data were included in only two patents, reflecting a broader challenge: the high cost of development limits real-world validation of these combinations. Despite this, the patent landscape offers valuable insights into emerging strategies for combating ESKAPE pathogens with cephalosporin-based therapies.",,,

This study investigates senescence-mediated inflammation as a novel mechanism of action for PARP inhibitors in HRP cancers. Transcriptome analyses were performed in olaparib-treated HeLa cells as a HRP model. Interferon regulatory factor-Lucia luciferase (IRF-Luc) reporter activity was assessed. The effects of PARP inhibitors on senescence-like phenotypes were assessed in seven HRP cancer cell lines, based on morphological changes, senescence-associated β-galactosidase (SA-β-GAL) activity, cellular granularity, and senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP)-related gene expression. Peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) migration assays were also performed with the conditioned medium in treatment with the PARP inhibitor. Transcriptome analyses revealed numbers of inflammatory cytokine- and chemokine-related pathways were significantly upregulated in olaparib-treated HeLa cells, which were confirmed by IRF-Luc reporter assays. The PARP inhibitors induced senescent phenotypes in HRP cancer cell lines: flattened and enlarged morphology, increased SA-β-GAL activity, elevated cellular granularity, and upregulated expressions of SASP-related genes (e.g., IL1B, IL6, and CXCL10). Furthermore, in vitro migration assays revealed that PARP inhibitor-treated HRP cancer cells attracted PBMCs more abundantly, suggesting the potential for recruiting immune cells to HRP cancer cells through senescence-mediated immunological activation. Our findings suggest that PARP inhibitors recruit immune cells to HRP cancer cells, potentially activating immune responses in the tumor microenvironment, providing new insights into the clinical benefits of PARP inhibitors in immunotherapy for patients with HRP OC.",,,rykamat@east.ncc.go.jp.

In the ARISE-HF trial, the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ), cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET), Physical Activity Scale for the Elderly (PASE) score, echocardiographic, and laboratory assessments were performed at baseline in 691 persons with DbCM. Study participants with lower KCCQ-Clinical Summary Score (CSS) were predominantly women, had poorer kidney function, higher body-mass index and natriuretic peptides, and lower hemoglobin levels. Lower KCCQ-CSS scores were associated with shorter CPET duration, lower peak exercise oxygen consumption (VO₂) and lower PASE scores, but the correlations were weak (CPET duration: r = 0.14, 95 % CI: 0.07-0.22; peak VO₂: r = 0.21, 95 % CI: 0.14-0.28; PASE score: r = 0.19, 95 % CI: 0.11-0.26), indicating that although worse health status was linked to poorer function and activity, the strength of these relationships was limited. No meaningful associations were observed between KCCQ-CSS and echocardiographic measurements, cardiac biomarkers, or kidney function.

This INTERASPIRE study determined the frequency of HTG and residual combined dyslipidemia and their related factors in patients with coronary heart disease (CHD) from 13 countries across six World Health Organization (WHO) regions. Participants with CHD underwent a standardized study interview and examination, including a centralized analysis of fasting blood samples. Elevated triglyceride (TG) and LDL-cholesterol were defined as ≥ 1.7 mmol/L and 1.8 mmol/L, respectively. Elevation in both was considered combined dyslipidemia. Lipid profiles were available for 4069 patients. The mean age was 60.1 years (21.1 % women, 12.6 % smokers, 24 % obesity by body mass index [BMI], 61 % hypertension, and 44 % self-reported diabetes). Participants were evaluated 1.05 (0.76-1.45) years after their index CHD hospitalization. Overall, 12.7 % used no lipid-lowering therapies (LLT), 50.0 % used high-dose statins, and 11.8 % used combination therapies. Specific TG-lowering therapies were used by 2.3 %. One-third of patients had HTG, and 24.6 % had combined dyslipidemia. HTG was seen in all countries, but median TG values varied, with higher values among those not using LLT. HTG was independently associated with female sex, smoking, BMI, blood pressure, and LDL-cholesterol. HTG was inversely associated with HDL-cholesterol.

This process usually involves two phases: first, collecting inexpensive variables from all samples, and second, selecting a subset for expensive measurements, for example, sequencing-based biomarkers. Common two-phase designs include nested case-control and case-cohort designs. Additional designs include sampling subjects based on follow-up time, like extreme case-control designs. Recently an optimal two-phase design using a maximum likelihood-based method was proposed, which could accommodate arbitrary sample selection in the second phase. However, direct comparisons of this optimal design with others in terms of power and computational cost is lacking. This study performs a direct evaluation of typical two-phase designs, including Tao's optimal design, on type I error, power, effect size estimation, and computational time, using both simulated and real data sets. Results show that the optimal design had the highest power and accurate effect size estimation under the Cox regression model. Surprisingly, logistic regression achieved similar power with much lower computational cost than a more sophisticated method. The study further applied these methods to the MP2PRT study, reporting hazard ratios of cancer subtypes on relapse risk. Recommendations for selecting two-phase designs and analysis methods are regarding power, bias of estimated effect size, and computational time.",Chen W,Department of Health Sciences Research,

This study aimed to quantify longitudinal changes in Unified Huntington's Disease Rating Scale (UHDRS) scores and evaluate their susceptibility to placebo response, enhancing our understanding of disease progression and ability to optimize future trials. We used data from the Enroll-HD natural history study (NCT01574053) and the GENERATION HD1 phase 3 clinical trial (NCT03761849) to model disease progression and placebo response for UHDRS scores, which are commonly used to evaluate disease progression in clinical trials. We included 8,071 Enroll-HD participants (mean baseline age: 51.4 years, 51.5% female) to develop a natural history progression model using baseline characteristics as predictive covariates. This model was then used to predict natural history progression of 260 participants from the GENERATION HD1 placebo arm (mean baseline age: 48.7 years, 43.5% female).The progression measured by Total Functional Capacity (TFC) in the GENERATION HD1 placebo arm aligned with predicted natural history (within 95% CI), indicating no significant placebo response. However, significant improvements (outside the 95% CI of the model) were observed after baseline for Total Motor Score (TMS), Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT) score, and Stroop Word Reading (SWR) score. The improvement in TMS persisted until the end of the dosing period (week 69), converging to natural history predictions at subsequent follow-up visits (weeks 85 and 101), suggesting a placebo effect. By contrast, cognitive scores (SDMT and SWR) showed sustained significant improvement (outside the 95% CI) up to the final follow-up visit at week 101, likely due to practice effects from the more frequent testing schedule in GENERATION HD1 compared with the annual assessments in Enroll-HD. Consequently, the composite UHDRS (cUHDRS) score, a linear combination of TFC, TMS, SDMT, and SWR, is influenced by both placebo and practice effects. Our results suggest that clinical scores in Huntington disease trials are susceptible to long-term placebo responses. These effects should be considered in future trial designs, especially when comparing trial data with natural history studies. Although based on the largest Huntington's trial, our results rely on limited placebo data and may not generalize to other trials with different populations, treatments, and designs.",Boareto M; Yamamoto Y; Sampaio C; McColgan P; Diack C; Ducray PS,CHDI Management; Roche Pharma Research and Early Development (pRED),

However, a greater understanding of stakeholder, including user, perspectives on JITAIs is needed. Focus groups with UK-based adult smokers (three groups; N = 19) and smoking cessation professionals (one group; N = 5) were conducted January-June 2024. Topic guides addressed the integration of a JITAI into users' lives, preferred content and features, and data and privacy. Transcripts were analysed using inductive and deductive Framework Analysis; deductive codes were derived from the Theoretical Domains Framework and the Technology Acceptance Model. Four co-equal major themes, ""Smoking Cessation Process"", ""JITAI Characteristics"", ""Perceived Value of the JITAI"", and ""Relationship with the JITAI"", and 16 subordinate themes were identified. The smoking cessation process was described as a challenging and idiosyncratic, non-linear journey during which a JITAI should provide consistent support. Preferences for specific JITAI characteristics varied. However, participants consistently expressed that a JITAI should be highly personalised and offer both immediate, interruptive support and ambient, in-depth content. The perceived usefulness and ease of use of a JITAI were described as central to its perceived value. Participants stressed that a JITAI would need to be convenient enough to easily integrate into users' daily lives, yet disruptive enough to facilitate behaviour change. Smokers expressed that they would want their relationship with a JITAI to feel supportive and non-judgmental. They also felt a JITAI should promote their autonomy. Smoking cessation professionals stressed the importance of privacy and data protection, whereas smokers appeared more ambivalent and had mixed opinions about this topic. JITAIs need to balance aspects of competing demands in their design, such as optimising for both convenience and sufficient disruption, promoting autonomy, and integrating interruptive and ambient content while also meeting stakeholder needs and expectations in terms of privacy.",,,

Infants eligible for nirsevimab immunization (born between 1 April, 2023, and 30 March, 2024) who were hospitalized due to RSV-related LRTI between September 25, 2023, and April 15, 2024, in a hospital from the Galician Public Health system were included. Clinical and demographic characteristics of RSV-related LRTI hospitalizations were analyzed, with comparisons made between breakthrough cases (those immunized with nirsevimab) and non-breakthrough cases. During the study period, 69 RSV-related LRTI hospitalizations were recorded, with a median hospital stay of 4 (interquartile range (IQR) 3-6) days; 65.2% (N = 45) were breakthrough cases. The median age was 2.7 (IQR 1.5-5.2) months, and more than half of them (N = 39, 56.5%) were male. The incidence of cases was parallel to the RSV epidemic curve, suggesting no waning of nirsevimab efficacy. Of the total hospitalizations, 16 infants (23.2%) had a high-risk condition, 44 (63.8%) needed oxygen support, 15 (21.7%) were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU), and 11 (15.9%) received non-invasive mechanical ventilation (NIMV). No statistically significant differences were observed in these characteristics when comparing breakthrough and non-breakthrough cases.

Many of these valuable molecules originate from traditional botanical pharmacopeias, repositories of centuries-old knowledge that are often underappreciated in modern research. This review highlights the medicinal plants identified in Sabah from 1922 to 2024, analyzing their taxonomical distribution, uses, utilization among ethnic groups, and their potential for clinical uses. The data for this review were gathered from Google Scholar, PubMed, ScienceDirect, Web of Science, PubMed, the Internet Archive, and Google Books. A keyword combination of ""Medicinal"" and ""Plants"" and ""Sabah"" yielded 21,700 results. Each result was examined, and articles that did not contain information relevant to the topic or came from non-peer-reviewed journals were excluded. Each of the remaining 87 selected articles was critically reviewed to extract pertinent information. A review of the available data indicates that 696 plant species are used in Sabah, including 412 angiosperms. These plants are primarily utilized to treat diseases or symptoms related to infections, digestive issues, injuries, and pains. Notably, 156 species employed by local Sabahan Dusunic, Murutic, and Kelabit ethnic groups remain unstudied in terms of their phytochemical and pharmacological properties, highlighting their potential for further investigation.

Chloroplasts are often chosen as attractive targets for the introduction of new agronomic traits because they have their own genome and protein synthesis machinery. Certain valuable traits have been genetically engineered into plastid genomes to improve crop yield, nutritional quality, resistance to abiotic and biotic stresses, and the production of industrial enzymes and therapeutic proteins. Synthetic biology approaches aim to play an important role in expressing multiple genes through plastid engineering, without the risk of pleiotropic effects in transplastomic plants. Despite many promising laboratory-level successes, no transplastomic crop has been commercialized to date. This technology is mostly confined to model species in academic laboratories and needs to be expanded to other agronomically important crop species to capitalize on its significant commercial potential. However, in recent years, some transplastomic lines are progressing in field trials, offering hope that they will pass regulatory approval and enter the marketplace. This review provides a comprehensive summary of new and emerging technologies employed for plastid transformation and discusses key synthetic biology elements that are necessary for the construction of modern transformation vectors.

Identifying distinct subphenotypes and understanding potential personalized modifications remain critical unmet needs. We applied unsupervised learning techniques to electronic medical records from UCSF to identify distinct Alzheimer's disease subphenotypes based on comorbidity profiles. We conducted enrichment analyses to determine cluster-specific comorbidities. Based on the observed sex-based differences, we subsequently conducted sex-stratified analyses to assess differences in disease manifestations between males and females. Findings were validated using an independent UC-Wide dataset. Among 8,363 patients, we identified five Alzheimer's disease subphenotypes, characterized by comorbidities related to cardiovascular conditions, gastrointestinal disorders, and frailty-related conditions such as pneumonia and pressure ulcers. Sex-stratified analyses revealed significant differences in comorbidity distributions across clusters. Notably, in Cluster 2, circulatory diseases were more prevalent among males, whereas in Cluster 3, bladder stones were more common among females. Key results were consistent across the UCSF and UC-Wide datasets. Our study identifies clinically meaningful Alzheimer's disease subphenotypes and highlights sex-specific variations, suggesting potential underlying biological factors such as Apolipoprotein E and gut microbiome alterations contributing to Alzheimer's disease heterogeneity. These findings underscore the need for further research into the biological mechanisms driving these differences and may inform the development of individualized therapeutic regimens.

Is the work of professionals in these fields subject to what some have called at recent industry conferences a failure of imagination? Are the tried-and-true methods and activities serving practitioners as well as they always have, or does today's world demand something different? The more important question is: In these conditions, how can crisis leaders do the most good? To answer that question, crisis management professionals may consider shifting their emphasis from planning, training and exercising alone and introducing more explicit focus on the delivery of good decision making - in other words, a transition of emphasis from response planning to more strategic programme management. All crises - whether fast burning, slow burning or creeping - require decision making. Ultimately in the aftermath, organisations and their leaders are judged not only on the outcomes of a crisis response, but on the decisions they made. Furthermore, this judgment is made not only on whether the decisions were right or wrong alone, but also whether they were defensible based on the best available information at the time. In confrontation with these realities, there is a unique role for enterprise crisis teams to define a value proposition along a set of guiding principles. From there, operational execution may be bridged through an integrated crisis management framework. This paper proposes a way forward along these lines.

In this systematic review we searched various databases (Clarivate Web of Science, EMBASE and Ovid Medline, Google Scholar, and PubMed) for publications containing the term ""clinical study report/s"", without restrictions. In the first part of this review we discussed the history of CSRs, their contents and structure, definitions, and relevant terminology. In this second part we discuss the uses of CSRs, concentrating on the individual benefits and harms of pharmacological interventions, and thus the benefit to harm balance. We also discuss adherence to interventions, prepublication of protocols of clinical trials, and how CSRs are written, factors that can all affect estimation of the benefit-harm balance. When clinical trial data from CSRs are compared with the data in published trial reports, the apparent benefits of pharmacological interventions are less impressive, and more information emerges about harms they can cause. Both of these effects change how the benefit-harm balance of a pharmacological intervention is estimated, generally making it less favourable than was otherwise thought. For more accurate assessment of the benefit-harm balance of an intervention, full, not abbreviated or synoptic, clinical study reports should continue to be made publicly available by regulatory authorities and manufacturers. Authorities that do not currently make them available should do so. CSRs should be introduced for assessment of surgical operations, therapeutic devices, and other non-pharmacological interventions in clinical trials.",,,jeffrey.aronson@phc.ox.ac.uk.

The imbalance between excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmissions may be implicated in the mechanism of action of ketamine. This study aimed to evaluate whether the ratio of glutamate and glutamine (Glx) to GABA levels at baseline in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) could predict ketamine response in patients with TRD. This exploratory study analyzed data from a double-blind randomized clinical trial with an open-label extension study (jRCTs031210124). Fifteen participants in the ketamine group and 15 of 16 participants in the placebo group received repeated intravenous ketamine during the double-blind and open-label extension periods, respectively. We measured Glx and GABA levels in the dACC before and after treatment during the double-blind period using proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS-17) was measured for depressive symptomatology. General linear models were used to examine the relationship between baseline Glx/GABA ratio and HDRS-17 score changes. Changes in HDRS-17 scores (mean (±SD)) following ketamine treatment were -4.9 (6.5) and -4.9 (5.2) in the double-blind and open-label periods, respectively. A higher baseline dACC Glx/GABA ratio was correlated with greater improvement in HDRS-17 (β = -0.42, p = 0.040). In the ketamine group, a reduction in the dACC Glx/GABA ratio was correlated with greater HDRS-17 improvement (β = 0.74, p = 0.009) with no such association in the placebo group. These results suggest that excitatory-inhibitory imbalance in the dACC may predict the efficacy of ketamine in TRD.",,,htani@keio.jp.

Disruption of redox homeostasis exacerbates ROS levels and instigates inflammation. Hypoxia-inducible factor 1 alpha (HIF-1α), essential for maintaining redox balance, is expressed in keratinocytes and plays a protective role in preserving the skin barrier. Stabilization of HIF-1α presents a potential therapeutic approach for UVR-induced sunburn. Our observations indicate that diosmetin inhibits the hydroxylation and ubiquitination of HIF-1α in UVR-induced sunburn. However, the precise mechanisms remain unclear. This study aims to elucidate the role and underlying mechanisms of diosmetin in the context of UVR-induced skin sunburn. In vivo UVR-induced sunburn mice models and in vitro UVR-exposed HaCaT cell models were established. We employed histopathological grade, oxidative stress assessment, ROS production measurement, and immunofluorescence staining of inflammatory markers to evaluate the activity of diosmetin. Additionally, RNA sequencing assay and co-immunoprecipitation assays were conducted to elucidate the underlying mechanisms. To verify the role of Rho Binding BTB Protein 3 (RhoBTB3), we performed intradermal injection rAAV-RhoBTB3-GFP to overexpress of RhoBTB3in mice. Diosmetin effectively inhibits the hydroxylation and ubiquitination of HIF-1α, resulting in significant antioxidative and anti-inflammatory effects in UVR-induced sunburn. RNA sequencing analysis and co-immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated that diosmetin reduces the formation of the RhoBTB3/PHD2 complex, thereby modulating the ubiquitination of HIF-1α and mitigating oxidative stress. Immunohistochemical analysis conducted on the wild-type and RhoBTB3-overexpressing mice revealed an enrichment of RhoBTB3, Prolyl Hydroxylase Domain protein 2 (PHD2), and HIF-1α in the epidermis. Notably, diosmetin stabilizes the HIF-1α protein and reduces oxidative stress by limiting the formation of the RhoBTB3/PHD2 complex in the epidermis of mice. Our study suggests that diosmetin acts as a regulator of the RhoBTB3/PHD2/HIF-1α axis to alleviate oxidative stress in sunburn, providing novel insights into potential treatments and mechanisms for sunburn.",,,zbs360@swu.edu.cn.

To date, none of the KIF5A variants was linked with dystonia. This study presents the first family with autosomal-dominant dystonia exhibiting incomplete penetrance, potentially linked to a KIF5A variant. Seven family members were recruited between 2017 and 2024. Detailed medical history and neurological examination were conducted for all. Genetic screening, including Sanger sequencing, MLPA analysis of SGCE, and PCR RFLP/BseRI for the common dystonia TOR1A mutation (c.907-909del), followed by whole exome sequencing, was performed on the proband and one affected relative. The genetic status of the remaining five individuals was assessed with Sanger sequencing. A missense variant in the KIF5A c.118G > A was found in four affected and one asymptomatic individual, while it was absent in two non-affected individuals. The variant is rare in the general population (0.00001 in gnomAD 4.0), affects a highly conserved amino acid, and in silico models (M-CAP) indicates it is pathogenic. It was classified as likely pathogenic per ACMG criteria (PM1, PM2, PP2, PP3). Our study suggests that KIF5A could represent a potential dystonia gene and sheds light on the broader role of motor proteins in human health and disease. This further expands the phenotypes associated with KIF5A and highlights the importance for clinicians to include this variant in their screening panels, as it tends to be underrepresented in current databases.",Wszolek ZK,Department of Neurology,Wszolek.Zbigniew@mayo.edu.

We report post-hoc analyses of pooled EGFR mutation tissue testing across osimertinib clinical trials, highlighting testing challenges and supporting best practice. Pooled central Cobas® EGFR Mutation Test data from nine global osimertinib NSCLC clinical trials were analyzed by specimen type, disease stage, and geographical region for specimen adequacy for testing and valid test results. Across 4,864 biopsies and 2,402 resections, 91% were adequate for testing, of which 95% of biopsies and 99% of resections had valid test results. Of biopsies, 12% were inadequate for testing (mainly due to insufficient tumor content [42%] and insufficient tissue volume [35%]) and 3% of resections were inadequate (insufficient tumor content [55%] and incorrect specimen preparation [12%]). Inadequacy varied by disease stage, from 3% in resectable stage IA2-IIIA to 10%-15% in first and second/later-line advanced/metastatic settings, and 16% in unresectable stage III. Test success rates among adequate specimens ranged from 93% (unresectable stage III) to 99% (resectable stage IA2-IIIA). Data were similar by geography. Most tissue specimens were adequate for EGFR testing. Inadequacy was commonly due to insufficient tissue volume or tumor content and higher in biopsies versus resections, and unresectable stage III and first-line advanced/metastatic versus other disease stages. Based on these controlled trial data, pre-analytic variables of tissue specimens are a major driver of testing success; hence maintaining optimal conditions from sample collection to biomarker analysis, as well as improving tissue-sampling techniques is critical to increase testing success rates.

40311117,Identification of Major Bleeding Events in Postoperative Patients With Malignant Tumors in Chinese Electronic Medical Records: Algorithm Development and Validation.,2025-05-02,JMIR formative research,10.2196/66189,"Postoperative bleeding is a serious complication following abdominal tumor surgery, but it is often not clearly diagnosed and documented in clinical practice in China. Previous studies have relied on manual interpretation of medical records to determine the presence of postoperative bleeding in patients, which is time-consuming and laborious. More critically, this manual approach severely hinders the efficient analysis of large volumes of medical data, impeding in-depth research into the incidence patterns and risk factors of postoperative bleeding. It remains unclear whether machine learning can play a role in processing large volumes of medical text to identify postoperative bleeding effectively. This study aimed to develop a machine learning model tool for identifying postoperative patients with major bleeding based on the electronic medical record system. This study used data from the available information in the National Health and Medical Big Data (Eastern) Center in Jiangsu Province of China. We randomly selected the medical records of 2,000 patients who underwent in-hospital tumor resection surgery between January 2018 and December 2021 from the database. Physicians manually classified each note as present or absent for a major bleeding event during the postoperative hospital stay. Feature engineering involved bleeding expressions, high-frequency related expressions, and quantitative logical judgment, resulting in 270 features. Logistic regression (LR), K-nearest neighbor (KNN), and convolutional neural network (CNN) models were developed and trained using the 1600-note training set. The main outcomes were accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) for each model. Major bleeding was present in 4.31% (69/1600) of the training set and 4.75% (19/400) of the test set. In the test set, the LR method achieved an accuracy of 0.8275, a sensitivity of 0.8947, a specificity of 0.8241, a PPV of 0.2024, an NPV of 0.9937, and an F1-score of 0.3301. The CNN method demonstrated an accuracy of 0.8900, sensitivity of 0.8421, specificity of 0.8924, PPV of 0.2807, NPV of 0.9913, and an F1-score of 0.4211. While the KNN method showed a high specificity of 0.9948 and an accuracy of 0.9575 in the test set, its sensitivity was notably low at 0.2105.

40309771,Chronic kidney disease enhances alternative pathway activity: a new paradigm.,2025-05-01,The Journal of clinical investigation,10.1172/JCI188353,"Reduced kidney function is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease in addition to kidney disease progression. Kidney disease is considered an inflammatory state, based on elevated levels of C-reactive protein and inflammatory cytokines. A key mediator of cardiovascular and kidney disease progression in the setting of reduced kidney function is systemic and vascular inflammation. However, the exact pathways that link chronic kidney disease (CKD) with inflammation remain incompletely understood. For decades it has been known that factor D, the main activator of the alternative complement pathway, is increased in the plasma of patients with reduced kidney function. Recent biomarker evidence suggests alternative pathway activation in this setting. CKD, therefore, seems to alter the balance of alternative pathway proteins, promoting inflammation and potentially exacerbating complement-mediated diseases and CKD-associated complications. In this manuscript, we review the impact of reduced kidney function on biomarkers of the alternative complement pathway and the implications of alternative pathway activation on cardiovascular disease and kidney disease progression. Importantly, we highlight the need for ongoing research efforts that may lead to opportunities to target the alternative pathway of complement withx the goal of improving kidney and cardiovascular outcomes in persons with reduced kidney function.",,,

In addition, diabetes is associated with a higher risk of developing chronic kidney disease, which is considered to be one of the strongest risk factors for CVD and mortality. To address the increased cardiovascular risk of patients with diabetes, dedicated screening strategies for CVD are necessary; conversely, screening for diabetes needs to be performed in all patients with CVD to allow timely identification. Once diabetes is diagnosed, rapid implementation of treatment with therapies to reduce cardiovascular risk on top of standard of care is necessary.

In recent years, there has been a shift toward incorporating patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) and patient-reported experience measures (PREMs) to capture service users' perspectives on treatment outcomes and experiences. The OMER-BE (Outcome Measurement and Evaluation as a Routine Practice in Alcohol and Other Drug Services in Belgium) study evaluates the acceptability and feasibility of PROMs and PREMs in different SUD treatment services, using the recently developed International Consortium for Health Outcomes Measurement Standard Set for Addictions. This paper presents the design and baseline characteristics of the study, indicators of attrition at 45-day follow-up, and the feasibility of the implementation of PROMs and PREMs in residential and outpatient services. A convenience sample of 189 treatment-seeking individuals with SUD from different inpatient (therapeutic communities and psychiatric centers) and outpatient treatment services was followed for six months. Sociodemographic characteristics; clinical factors; and PROMs including recovery strengths, quality of life, and global health were assessed at baseline and within 3 weeks after starting treatment. Additionally, PROMs and PREMs were measured 45, 90, and 180 days later. Comparisons were made between treatment modalities, and indicators of attrition at the 45-day follow-up were assessed using ANOVA and chi-square tests. Baseline differences were observed between the three treatment modalities regarding education, SUD treatment history, primary substance, and Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder Self-Report scores. Overall, patients in psychiatric treatment centers had a higher education level and less polysubstance use, while outpatients had fewer previous SUD treatments but received relatively more often opioid agonist treatment. Inpatients reported more attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder symptoms and higher SUD severity than outpatients. Additionally, recovery strength scores were significantly lower in the outpatient group compared to the other groups, particularly in the subdomains of ""Substance Use,"" ""Self-care,"" and ""Outlook on Life."" At the 45-day follow-up assessment, the attrition rate was 36.6%. Comparisons between participants who completed the 45-day follow-up and those who dropped out revealed that completers were significantly older, had a higher level of education, were more likely to live alone, and were more likely to have a mother born in Belgium. They also had higher average scores on the ""Material Resources"" domain of the Substance Use Recovery Evaluator, which includes questions about stable housing, a steady income, and effective financial management. Evaluating PROMs and PREMs appears to be feasible in a diverse group of treatment-seeking patients with SUD in Belgium. However, challenges remain for structural implementation in practice, especially in outpatient services. Routine monitoring of PROMs and PREMs has the potential to empower patients, service providers, and policy makers by providing a comprehensive understanding of service users' needs and treatment effectiveness.",Migchels C; Fernandez K; Antoine J; Matthys F; Crunelle CL,Department of Epidemiology and Public Health; Department of Psychiatry,

Eosinophils, which play a critical role in the pathophysiology of EGPA, require interleukin (IL)-5 for maturation in the bone marrow and migration to tissues. Glucocorticoids and immunosuppressants have been the cornerstone of treatment; however, their side effects have imposed a significant burden on many patients. Mepolizumab, an antibody that binds to and neutralizes IL-5, demonstrated efficacy in controlling disease activity in EGPA in the MIRRA trial conducted in 2017. In 2024, benralizumab, an IL-5 receptor alpha antagonist, was shown to be non-inferior to mepolizumab in efficacy against EGPA in the MANDARA trial. Both drugs were originally used for severe asthma and have benefited EGPA by reducing eosinophil counts. Due to differences in pharmacological structure and pharmacokinetics, the degree of eosinophil suppression varies between the two agents, and recent studies suggest that they may also affect inflammatory and homeostatic eosinophils differently.

Many models predicting bioactive peptide function or structure rely on their intrinsic properties, including the influence of amino acid composition, sequence, and chain length, which impact stability, folding, aggregation, and target interaction. Homology modelling predicts peptide structures based on known templates. Peptide-protein interactions can be explored using molecular docking techniques, but there are challenges related to the inherent flexibility of peptides, which can be addressed by more computationally intensive approaches that consider their movement over time, called molecular dynamics (MD). Virtual screening of many peptides, usually against a single target, enables rapid identification of potential bioactive peptides from large libraries, typically using docking approaches. The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) has transformed peptide discovery by leveraging large amounts of data. AlphaFold is a general protein structure prediction tool based on deep learning that has greatly improved the predictions of peptide conformations and interactions, in addition to providing estimates of model accuracy at each residue which greatly guide interpretation. Peptide function and structure prediction are being further enhanced using Protein Language Models (PLMs), which are large deep-learning-derived statistical models that learn computer representations useful to identify fundamental patterns of proteins. Recent methodological developments are discussed in the context of canonical peptides, as well as those with modifications and cyclisations.

We conducted a cross-sectional population-based serological study in southern China between June and October 2021. We determined the population mean antibody concentration and seroprevalence by age and over time, along with their associated determinants. Moreover, we estimated the contact-adjusted immunity levels by considering both age-specific immunity levels and population contact rates. Among the 1015 study participants (aged 0-95 years), the overall seroprevalence was estimated at 80.9% (95% confidence interval [CI], 78.3-83.3). When adjusting for the age-specific contact rates, the contact-adjusted immunity was estimated at 66.8% (95% CI, 56.6-75.1).

In particular, individuals born after the last SIA (2010) showed a significantly faster waning of immunity. Our findings highlight that immunity levels in the general population remain below the 95% threshold, underscoring the need for continued monitoring of immunity dynamics, especially for individuals born in a near-elimination setting and without subsequent SIAs.",,,

Demographic data and premonitory symptoms in cluster headache and migraine patients were analysed. The primary focus was on premonitory symptom presence and phenotype in cluster headache patients, with secondary analysis exploring associated factors and comparing spontaneous and nitroglycerin-triggered symptoms in cluster headache and migraine cohorts.ResultsAmong 164 cluster headache patients, 122/164 (74%) males, aged 45.9 ± 13.8 years (mean ± SD), 66/164 (40%) had chronic cluster headache and 32/164 (20%) had also comorbid migraine. Among them, 85% exhibited premonitory symptoms for which the presence was associated with oxygen treatment. No significant differences were found in symptom frequency between cluster headache and migraine cohorts or within spontaneous and nitroglycerin-triggered symptoms.ConclusionsThis study highlights recognizable spontaneous and nitroglycerin-triggered premonitory symptoms in cluster headache and factors potentially impacting cluster headache management, which may aid in tailoring treatment strategies for both conditions through the use of treatment prediction and early intervention.",,,
40302034,"Heparan-6-O-endosulfatase 2, a cancer-related proteoglycan enzyme, is effectively inhibited by a specific sea cucumber fucosylated glycosaminoglycan.",2025-05-07,Glycobiology,10.1093/glycob/cwaf025,"Heparan-6-O-endosulfatase 2 (Sulf-2) is a proteoglycan enzyme that modifies sulfation of heparan sulfate proteoglycans. Dysregulation of Sulf-2 is associated with various pathological conditions, including cancer, which makes Sulf-2 a potential therapeutic target. Despite the key pathophysiological roles of Sulf-2, inhibitors remain insufficiently developed. In previous work, a fucosylated chondroitin sulfate from the sea cucumber Holothuria floridana (HfFucCS) exhibited potent Sulf-2 inhibition. This study investigates the structural basis of HfFucCS-mediated Sulf-2 inhibition, examines the binding profile of HfFucCS to Sulf-2, and explores the mode of inhibition. Additionally, a structurally diverse library of sulfated poly/oligosaccharides, including common glycosaminoglycans and unique marine sulfated glycans, was screened for Sulf-2 inhibition. Results from a high-throughput arylsulfatase assay and specific 6-O-desulfation assay have proved that HfFucCS is the most potent among the tested sulfated glycans, likely due to the presence of the unique 3,4-disulfated fucose structural motif. HfFucCS demonstrated non-competitive inhibition, and inhibitory analysis of its low-molecular-weight fragments suggests a minimum length of ~7.5 kDa for effective inhibition. Surface plasmon resonance analyses revealed that Sulf-2 binds to surface heparin with high affinity (KD of 0.817 nM). HfFucCS and its derivatives effectively disrupt this interaction. Results from mass spectrometry-hydroxyl radical protein footprinting and repulsive scaling replica exchange molecular dynamics indicate similarities in the binding of heparin and HfFucCS oligosaccharides to both the catalytic and hydrophilic domains of Sulf-2. These findings reveal the unique inhibitory properties of a structurally distinct marine glycosaminoglycan, supporting its further investigation as a selective and effective inhibitor for Sulf-2-associated cancer events.",,,

The NADPH oxidase dual oxidase 2 (DUOX2) is upregulated in patients with IBD, yet its role in driving the disease remains unclear. We interrogated the functional consequences of epithelial DUOX2 activity for the host and microbiome. DUOX2 function was studied in mice with epithelial-specific DUOX2 overactivation (vTLR4), inactivation (vTLR4 DUOXA IEC-KO) and wild-type controls. We assessed the effect of dysbiosis on DUOX2 signalling and intestinal permeability (FITC-dextran, serum zonulin, bacterial translocation) with germ-free (GF) mice engrafted with IBD or healthy microbiota. RNA sequencing of colonic mucosa and microbiota and faecal metabolomics were used to characterise the host-microbe interface. Mechanistic studies were conducted in mouse colonoids, IBD biopsies and patient serum samples. DUOX2 activity increased permeability and bacterial translocation and induced subclinical inflammation in vTLR4 mice. GF vTLR4 mice had increased DUOX2 activity and permeability but no subclinical inflammation. In patients with IBD, DUOX2 expression was positively associated with plasma zonulin levels and negatively associated with ZO-1 expression. Engraftment of GF mice with IBD stool increased DUOX2 activity and triggered low-grade inflammation and permeability defects in mice. DUOX2 activity functionally altered the microbiome, reduced butyrate metabolism and promoted proinflammatory and pro-oncogenic bacterial metabolites. Butyrate and histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors blocked DUOX2 activation and reversed its effects. Elevated DUOX2 signalling contributes to epithelial barrier dysfunction, microbiome alterations and subclinical inflammation. Butyrate and HDAC inhibitors reversed these effects, indicating that DUOX2 may be a therapeutic target in IBD.",,,maria.abreu@cshs.org.
40300810,"Worldwide Regulatory Reliance: Results of an Executed Chemistry, Manufacturing and Control Post Approval Change Pilot.",,PDA journal of pharmaceutical science and technology,10.5731/pdajpst.2024-003023.1,"Post-approval changes (PACs) are integral to pharmaceutical product lifecycle management ensuring that the product remains safe, effective, and compliant with evolving standards. However, managing these changes across multiple regulatory jurisdictions remains a challenging endeavor due to diverse regulatory requirements and timelines across national regulatory authorities (NRAs). This results in delays obtaining approval from NRAs, impacting global supply chains, and ultimately jeopardizing timely access of essential medical products to patients. In 2021, the WHO issued the Good Reliance Practices (GReIP) guidance to encourage streamlined PAC review and approval process while maintaining access to quality-assured, safe, and effective medicinal products. NRAs are encouraged to rely on the assessment completed by a reference authority that agrees to provide the outcomes of its regulatory expertise. The ultimate objective of this guidance is to accelerate the overall process for PACs, ultimately fostering more equitable and timely access of medical products to populations who need them. This approach was tested in a CMC PAC pilot to determine the feasibility of using the principles of regulatory reliance based on the recommendations outlined in the GReIP with the goal of establishing a predictable, 6-month approval timeframe across multiple NRAs. The design and management of this pilot is described in Gastineau et al.This paper describes the outcomes of the pilot which demonstrates that regulatory reliance is feasible. Of the 21 Regulatory NRAs that agreed to participate, 55% were able to complete the review within 6 months; within 10 months, 95% of approvals were received and, after 16 months, all participating countries had approved the PAC. The use of a Q&A SharePoint Tool allowed for visibility of the questions raised and company responses amongst NRAs. Feedback on this reliance pilot was solicited from the participating NRAs and provides further support for future CMC PAC reliance cases.",Ban C; Graham J; Le Palaire L; Persaud P; Brehme F; Faure O; Rameau A; Silva AL,Sanofi,Cynthia.ban@sanofi.com

This modeling approach can assist with biopharmaceutics risk assessment and the establishment of patient centric, clinically relevant drug product specifications. However, the variability of possible model strategies and the existence of gaps in scientific knowledge associated with the lack of standardized regulatory expectations for model parametrization, data requirements for model development, and criteria for fit-for-purpose model validation leads to varied acceptance rates and frequent requests for additional information and deficiencies in PBBM submissions across regulatory agencies. During the 2023 Maryland Center of Excellence in Regulatory Science and Innovation (M-CERSI) PBBM Best Practices for Drug Product Quality: Regulatory and Industry Perspectives workshop, it was identified that a PBBM report template summarizing model considerations and proposing a structure for presenting question(s) of interest, model context, input data, a modeling plan, and validation would be beneficial for both industry and regulatory agencies. The present work is not a regulatory guideline but rather a summary of current best practices and considerations for PBBM submissions.

Industrial extraction of antibiotics from fermentation broth using organic solvents raises various environmental and health concerns. In this study, a thermosensitive polymer, NPE-108, was used to construct an aqueous two-phase system (ATPS) for the extraction of spiramycin. We used Gromacs software to develop a molecular dynamics simulation model to reveal the distribution mechanism of spiramycin molecules in the NPE-108/water ATPS from a microscopic perspective. Additionally, we examined the effects of volume ratio, temperature, and pH on extraction through experimentation. Under the optimal conditions for forward extraction, the distribution coefficient and extraction efficiency were 25.3 and 89.9%, respectively. Under the optimal conditions for back extraction, the distribution coefficient and extraction efficiency were 6.8 and 81.5%, respectively. Optimization of crystallization conditions resulted in a crystal yield of 88.1% and a purity of 98.4%.

MRIs are historically performed post-operatively and/or at treatment planning. Continuous interfractional changes during CRT have not been adequately characterized. MR-guided radiation therapy (MRgRT) allows for detailed imaging of tumor volumes during the course of treatment. This is a preliminary initial report evaluating temporal and spatial changes that occur in GBM, in order to model tumor dynamics. Five GBM patients enrolled onto an institutional biorepository registry underwent treatment with our 0.35T MRgRT workflow. Target volumes were delineated based on T2/FLAIR (GTV_46Gy) and T1 gadolinium-enhanced MR (GTV_14Gy) sequences. Weekly post-contrast MRIs were performed during CRT with the 0.35T magnet to monitor target volume dynamics. Thirty-five MR scans were evaluated. The median time from surgery to CRT was 32 days (range: 28-40), with a median of 13 days (range: 12-14) from simulation to CRT. We found median volume reductions of 40.0% (range: 8.3-86.5%), and 37.1% (range: 15.0-67.5%) for GTV_46Gy and GTV_14Gy, respectively. The bulk of these changes occurred early, within the first 3 weeks of the 6-week treatment, with significant reductions observed between baseline and week 1 -32.6% for GTV_46Gy and 17.9% for GTV_14Gy. Separately, statistically significant volume reductions for the cavity volume (F = 59.43, p < 0.05) were observed. Compared to baseline, centroid migrations of the target volumes were also noted: the median GTV_46Gy centroid migration was 7.4 mm (range: 2.0-10.8 mm) and the median GTV_14Gy centroid migration was 3.6 mm (range: 1.3-8.8 mm). Our pilot study suggests that weekly MRgRT imaging for GBM patients undergoing long course CRT reveals significant GTV reductions and centroid migrations, especially during the first 3 weeks of treatment. A more detailed understanding of which patients are at highest risk for tumor change and migration is needed to best apply these imaging parameters to clinical practice.",,,rupeshk@baptisthealth.net.

First line therapies for localized GA include topical and intralesional corticosteroids. Systemic corticosteroids have been used for generalized; however, rates of partial and complete resolution are disappointing. Recent advances in understanding the pathophysiology of macrophage activation and granuloma formation have led to Janus Kinase (JAK) inhibition as a therapeutic target for GA. The objectives of our study were to provide insight into the pathophysiology of GA and describe the clinical course and findings in patients with GA on JAK inhibitor therapy. This is a retrospective case series of 9 adults (age ≥ 18 years) with a diagnosis of GA and concomitant use of an oral JAK inhibitor. All patients on oral JAK inhibitor therapy (upadacitinib or abrocitinib) had improvement and/or clearance of their GA lesions within the first three months of therapy. Few adverse events commonly implicated in JAK inhibitor therapy (e.g., URI symptoms, malaise, acne) were reported. This study is limited by small sample size. JAK inhibitor therapy can be used in patients with GA, especially if they failed other treatments. Furthermore, JAK inhibitor therapy resulted in faster clearance time compared to other conventional treatments (e.g., antimicrobials, antimalarials, apremilast, methotrexate, and anti-tumor necrosis factor inhibitors). Depending on extent of GA involvement and patient-provider preferences, oral JAK inhibition therapy can be used off-label.

However, trial protocols vary in their completeness and often do not address key elements of design and conduct. The SPIRIT (Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Interventional Trials) statement was first published in 2013 as guidance to improve the completeness of trial protocols. Periodic updates incorporating the latest evidence and best practices are needed to ensure that the guidance remains relevant to users. Here, we aimed to systematically update the SPIRIT recommendations for minimum items to address in the protocol of a randomized trial. We completed a scoping review and developed a project-specific database of empirical and theoretical evidence to generate a list of potential changes to the SPIRIT 2013 checklist. The list was enriched with recommendations provided by lead authors of existing SPIRIT/CONSORT (Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials) extensions (Harms, Outcomes, Non-pharmacological Treatment) and other reporting guidelines (TIDieR). The potential modifications were rated in a three-round Delphi survey followed by a consensus meeting. Overall, 317 individuals participated in the Delphi consensus process and 30 experts attended the consensus meeting. The process led to the addition of two new protocol items, revision to five items, deletion/merger of five items, and integration of key items from other relevant reporting guidelines. Notable changes include a new open science section, additional emphasis on the assessment of harms and description of interventions and comparators, and a new item on how patients and the public will be involved in trial design, conduct and reporting. The updated SPIRIT 2025 statement consists of an evidence-based checklist of 34 minimum items to address in a trial protocol, along with a diagram illustrating the schedule of enrollment, interventions and assessments for trial participants. To facilitate implementation, we also developed an expanded version of the SPIRIT 2025 checklist and an accompanying explanation and elaboration document.

However, protection has eroded over time due to the emergence of antigenically diverse viral variants, especially the Omicron subvariants. One successful platform for the generation of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines are recombinant spike protein vaccines, of which two are licensed in the United States and Europe. Typically, purified recombinant protein antigens are poorly immunogenic and adjuvants must be included in the formulation. Here, we adjuvanted recombinant ancestral SARS-CoV-2 Wuhan-Hu-1 spike proteins with an emulsion formulation combined with synthetic Toll-like receptor (TLR) 4 and 7/8 agonists. This combination led to the induction of a Th1-skewed immune response that included high titers of antibodies against Wuhan-Hu-1 spike. These serum antibodies included neutralizing and cross-reactive antibodies that recognized the spike from multiple SARS-CoV-2 variants, as well as the receptor binding domain (RBD) from SARS-CoV-1. Despite an absence of robust cross-neutralization, vaccination against Wuhan-Hu-1 spike in the context of TLR-containing emulsions provided complete cross-protection against disease from a lethal challenge with XBB.1 in a stringent K18-hACE2 mouse model. We believe that the combination of recombinant spike antigens with TLR agonist-based emulsion formulations could lead to the development of next-generation SARS-CoV-2 vaccines that provide significant protection from future emerging variants.",,,jay.evans@mso.umt.edu.

To investigate the risk of PMR after COVID-19 vaccination using self-controlled case series (SCCS) analysis METHODS: We used the National Health Insurance Database, linked with the COVID-19 registry between February 2021 and August 2023, to identify adults aged 50 years or older who received at least one dose of COVID-19 vaccine and subsequently diagnosed with PMR within the observation period, defined as 240 days after the first dose of vaccine. The risk window was defined as 28 days after each dose of COVID-19 vaccination, and the control window encompassed the remainder of the observation period. Incidence rate ratios (IRRs) were estimated using conditional Poisson regression with 95% CIs, stratified by dose and vaccine type. Among 44 818 078 COVID-19 vaccine recipients, 376 patients were diagnosed with PMR. The analysis indicated that COVID-19 vaccination was not associated with an increased risk of PMR (IRR, 0.74; 95% CI 0.59 to 0.94). Rather, the risk of PMR was slightly reduced after the first dose (0.52; 0.34 to 0.79), with no significant association with other doses of COVID-19 vaccine (0.83; 0.59 to 1.16 for second dose, 0.77, 0.48 to 1.25 for third dose). In this nationwide SCCS, there was no association with the increased risk of PMR following COVID-19 vaccination.

We used the 2016-2019 US National Inpatient Sample data that contain all hospitalisation data. In people with a diagnosis of SLE, we assessed the multivariable adjusted ORs (aORs) to examine the association of rural patient residence with MI hospitalisation, while adjusting for demographics, payer, income, hospital characteristics and the Deyo-Charlson Comorbidity Index. We found that the crude rates of patients hospitalised with MI per 100 000 area specific SLE hospitalisations were higher in rural versus urban residents with SLE, 2265 versus 1435 (p value<0.001). In the multivariable-adjusted model that accounted for demographics, insurance payer, household income, comorbidities and hospital characteristics including geographical location, we found that rural residence was associated with an aOR of 1.98 (95% CI, 1.71 to 2.29; reference category, urban residence) of MI hospitalisations in people with SLE. Other factors significantly associated with the risk of MI were male sex, Medicaid or private insurance, urban not teaching or urban teaching hospital, Midwest region and a private hospital control, either for profit or not for profit. Rural residence doubled the risk of MI hospitalisation in people with SLE independent of demographics, payer status, social determinants of health and hospital characteristics. Our study highlights the disproportionate effect of rurality on health outcomes in people with SLE within the USA and a clear rural-urban gap disparity.

QST results complied with Aẟ- und C-fiber damage, including increased cold, warmth and mechanical detection thresholds, higher thermal sensory limen and allodynia. Intraepidermal nerve fiber densities were low in 7 / 17 children. This resulted in a great impact on physical quality of life and pain scales but not on social life. Five children showed heterozygous variants of unknown significance (VUS) in genes encoding VGSC (SCN9A, n=2; SCN10A, n=3) with maternal or paternal inheritance in two and one patient, respectively. Three further patients showed likely disease-associated variants in the HUWE1, TRIO and PYGM genes. Despite a high disease burden and small fiber damage indicated by QST and skin histology, only VUS in VGSC and additional monogenic causes of pain symptoms outside of VGSC genes were identified. Genetic studies in affected children should therefore be comprehensive, not restricted to VGSC variants and be supplemented by a detailed clinical workup. In silico modelling and future functional studies might help to identify VUS that play a role in altered pain perception.",Quade A; Hageb Z; Rolke R; Dohrn M; Schacht G; Weis J; Häusler M,Department of Palliative Medicine; Department of Pediatrics; Department of Neurology; Department of Neuropathology,

We analyzed the coagulation potential of emicizumab combined with warfarin in a simulated model of PwHA. Nineteen samples were collected from ten patients taking warfarin, and the prothrombin time-international normalized ratio (PT-INR) was used to define near-normal (INR 1.2-1.48; n = 4), subtherapeutic (INR 1.56-1.9; n = 7) and therapeutic (INR > 2.0; n = 8) groups. Factor (F)VIII activity (FVIII:C) was neutralized using an anti-FVIII inhibitor antibody (termed FVIII-depleted) before the addition of emicizumab (50 µg/mL). Coagulation potential was measured using Ca2 + -triggered rotational thromboelastometry, and was compared with that in emicizumab-treated PwHA. The average PT-INR in the near-normal, subtherapeutic, and therapeutic groups was 1.3 ± 0.1, 1.7 ± 0.1, and 2.4 ± 0.3, respectively. The hemostatic potential in FVIII-depleted samples mixed with emicizumab in the near-normal group was comparable to that in emicizumab-treated PwHA. The coagulation potential in FVIII-depleted samples after addition of emicizumab in the subtherapeutic and therapeutic groups were lower than that in emicizumab-treated PwHA.

With increasing economic growth, rising life expectancy, and rapid technological advancements, the healthcare needs of the population have surged. This is particularly evident with the rise in chronic diseases, growing healthcare awareness, and the growing demand for personalized care and treatment. Medical devices, which encompass a wide range of machines, instruments, apparatus, and even software, play a vital role in diagnosing, treating, preventing, monitoring, and providing palliative care for various health conditions. Examples include X-ray machines, pacemakers, hip implants, ultrasound machines, glucose metres, prosthetics, and defibrillators. These devices are indispensable in the healthcare continuum across India. However, the development of India's medical device industry faces significant challenges, including limited infrastructure, outdated regulatory frameworks, and an inability to support sustainable growth. The Johnson & Johnson hip implant scandal highlighted the gaps in the existing regulatory system. The current Drugs and Cosmetics Act of 1940 (DCA, 1940) is inadequate in defining medical devices, regulating their import and manufacture, ensuring patient safety, managing adverse event reporting, and holding medical device companies accountable. To address these issues, the Medical Device Rules was introduced by the Government of India in 2017 (MDR, 2017). However, there has been a long-standing need for a more comprehensive legislative framework specifically for medical devices. To this end, the new Drugs, Medical Devices, and Cosmetics Bill of 2022 was proposed to substitute the outdated 1940 Act. This doctrinal research critically examines the shortcomings of the current DCA,1940 vis-à-vis the case study of Johnson & Johnson hip implant issue and provides a comparative analysis of this Act with the newly proposed Drugs, Medical Devices, and Cosmetics Bill of 2022.",,,ashishbaldi@mrsptu.ac.in.

Naproxen (NAP), a poorly water-soluble drug, was selected as a model compound to assess the drug-loading capacity of the synthesized CDNSs. The effect of each reaction parameter on NAP integration into the CDNSs was examined at varying weight ratios. The optimal reaction conditions were determined to be a solubilization time of 6 h, an ECH/CD molar ratio of 8/1, and an NaOH concentration of 33%. Under these conditions, the NAP loading efficiency of α-CDNSs was calculated as 67.12%. Comparative analysis revealed that α-CDNSs outperformed β-CDNSs in terms of drug-loading capacity.

One promising approach to address these challenges is the dietary supplementation of non-digestible oligosaccharides (NDOs). NDOs, including human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs), play a vital role in shaping and sustaining a healthy gut microbiota. Beyond stimulating the growth and activity of beneficial gut bacteria, NDOs can also interact directly with pathogenic bacteria and viruses. Their antiviral and antibacterial properties arise from their unique interactions with pathogens and their ability to modulate the host's immune system. NDOs can function as decoy receptors, inhibit pathogen growth, bind to bacterial toxins, stimulate the host immune response, exhibit anti-biofilm properties, and enhance barrier protection. However, a notable gap exists in the comprehensive assessment of in vivo and clinical data on this topic. This review aims to provide an in-depth overview of the in vivo evidence related to the antiviral and antibacterial effects of various NDOs and HMOs, with a focus on discussing their possible mechanisms of action.",Nauta A; Groeneveld A,FrieslandCampina,

Its pathogenesis may be related to T cell-mediated autoimmune attack on hair follicles. Its clinical manifestations are mostly round or oval patches of AA, which can progress to Alopecia Totalis (AT) and Alopecia Universalis (AU). In severe cases, it affects the psychological health and quality of life of patients. In the past, the treatment of AA mainly relied on intra-lesional or systemic application of glucocorticoids, minoxidil or immunomodulators, which had problems such as limited efficacy and high recurrence rate. Some studies have also found that JAK inhibitors have improved effects on many autoimmune diseases, including AA. This case report presents a patient with AA who achieved significant therapeutic effects from treatment with Tofacitinib Citrate Sustained-Release Tablets, manufactured by Qilu Pharmaceutical Company in China. Due to the recurrence rate of AA, patients are likely to need long-term medication. The resulting economic burden cannot be ignored. We therefore investigated the mechanisms and economic benefits of various JAK inhibitors in the treatment of AA, in order to provide better guidance to patients with recurring disease who need long-term medication, and to their doctors in choosing a more rational therapeutic agent according to the patient's condition and economic status.",,,

Levodopa (l-dopa) is a mainstay of therapy and is typically followed by the addition of a catechol- A medical research summary on how use the drug safinamide in Asian patients with Parkinson’s disease Parkinson’s disease is a growing problem in Asia as populations age. The treatment approach in Asia is similar to other parts of the world, even though Parkison’s disease might affect Asian patients differently. A common treatment is Levodopa (L-dopa), often combined with other drugs to address ‘wear-off’ effects, which occur when L-dopa stops working before the next dose. This article focuses on safinamide, a drug used with L-dopa to manage Parkinson’s disease. Asian neurologists reviewed studies to find the best ways to use safinamide in Asian patients. Research shows that safinamide helps reduce wear-off effects, improves movement, and eases some non-movement symptoms like bladder issues and sleep problems. Safinamide is well tolerated, works well for older patients, and may lower the risk of unwanted movements (dyskinesias) in long-term treatment. The authors recommend safinamide as an option for managing Parkinson’s disease in Asian patients. However, they call for more research on its effects on pain, the right doses, and how it works for younger patients with Parkinson’s disease.",,,

This framework, in addition to the crystalline structure of cellulosic fibers and the rigidity of lignin, makes lignocellulosic biomass (LCB) highly recalcitrant to degradation. Xylanases are glycoside hydrolases that cleave the β-1,4-glycoside linkages in the xylan backbone and have attracted increasing attention due to their potential uses in various industrial sectors such as pulp and paper, baking, pharmaceuticals, and lignocellulosic biorefining. For decades, the measurement of xylanase activity was based on reducing sugar quantification methods like DNS or Nelson/Somogyi assays, with numerous limitations in terms of specificity and interference from other enzymatic activities. A better alternative is the colorimetric Azo-Xylan assay, which specifically measures the endo-1,4-β-D-xylanase activity. In this study, the Azo-Xylan protocol was adapted from the company Megazyme to determine the enzymatic activity of thermostable xylanases produced by microbial consortia (i.e., microbiomes), aiming to determine biochemical features such as temperature and pH optima, thermostability, and shelf life. This modified approach offers a rapid, cost-effective, and highly specific method for the determination of xylanase activity in complex mixtures, helping the development of a xylanase-based method for the hydrolysis of hard-degrading substrates in bio-based industries.

Consequently, high quality evidence for anticancer drug dosing in reduced kidney function is limited and no internationally agreed guidelines exist to inform prescribing decisions in this population. A methodology for guideline development was applied which did not require availability of RCTs but used critical appraisal of existing observational literature and group consensus. An international multidisciplinary working group (n = 38) established consensus recommendations in two parts to form the International Consensus Guideline on Anticancer Drug Dosing in Kidney Dysfunction (ADDIKD). The approach enabled virtual participation worldwide. In Part 1 we developed a standardised approach for assessment and classification of kidney function in patients with cancer using global nephrology standards and working group expertise. Part 2 involved a comprehensive literature search of 59 anticancer drugs followed by a critical appraisal of the evidence certainty through the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) process and development of dosing recommendations in reduced kidney function. Key external stakeholders (n = 9) invited expert contributors (n = 25), and the working group participated in virtual interactive workshops to vote on the acceptability of these recommendations. The participants were provided with evaluation of the literature, and they engaged in several rounds of virtual discussion (involving robustness of the evidence behind recommendations and their real-world application) and anonymous consensus voting. Adapting the ADDIKD guideline development process to a virtual format enabled engagement with a very broad base of specialised international experts especially during the global pandemic. Combining GRADE methodology with consensus-building approaches was an effective method of producing recommendations (in an area lacking RCTs) by merging critical review of the literature with expert opinion and clinical practice.

KDIGO guidelines have been adopted by most internal medicine specialities for the assessment and classification of kidney function, but not by cancer medicine. The development of the International Consensus Guideline on Anticancer Drug Dosing in Kidney Dysfunction (ADDIKD) aims to overcome the perceived challenges with KDIGO recommendations by describing their utility in patients with cancer. Two virtual, consensus building workshops were held consecutively, involving international, multidisciplinary participants (Part 1 of ADDIKD development). During these workshops, three consensus recommendations were agreed upon based on KDIGO's principles; to standardise kidney function assessment, classify kidney function, and determine a uniform approach to dose anticancer drugs in patients with reduced kidney function. Cancer clinicians attending the workshops identified issues regarding the adoption of KDIGO's recommendations. These issues were addressed by nephrologists, clinical pharmacologists, and other clinicians with extensive experience in the contemporary assessment of kidney function. The key concern for cancer specialists was a hesitancy to move away from the familiar and long-standing practice of using the Cockcroft-Gault equation to estimate creatinine clearance. The consensus building within the two multidisciplinary workshops allowed a thorough assessment of the evidence and clarified how directly measured GFR and eGFR, rather than creatinine clearance, could be optimally utilised in cancer care. The development of Part 1 of the ADDIKD guideline represents a standardised, contemporary approach to the assessment, classification, and utility of kidney function in the setting of cancer care and it harmonises with the approach used in other areas of medicine internationally.

Of 183 patients with informed consent, 164 were treated with brexpiprazole 1 or 2 mg/day for 14 weeks (prior brexpiprazole subgroup: 102 patients, prior placebo subgroup: 62 patients), and the overall study completion rate was 71.3%. The overall incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events was 90.2% (in each subgroup, 90.2% and 90.3%, respectively). Most treatment-emergent adverse events were mild or moderate in severity, and no new safety signals were observed. Regarding the Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory total score at Week 14 (last observation carried forward), the mean change from baseline (standard deviation) was -4.0 (9.8). The extended 14-week treatment with brexpiprazole 1 or 2 mg/day after 10-week treatment was generally well tolerated in Japanese patients with agitation associated with dementia due to Alzheimer's disease, and the efficacy was maintained.",Adachi J; Hirota N; Iba K; Shimizu K; Nakai M; Mori N; Takahashi K,Headquarters of Clinical Development; Department of Medical Affairs,
40290585,Quantifying the Unknowns of Plaque Morphology: The Role of Topological Uncertainty in Coronary Artery Disease.,,Mayo Clinic proceedings. Digital health,10.1016/j.mcpdig.2025.100217,"This article aimed to explore topological uncertainty in medical imaging, particularly in assessing coronary artery calcification using artificial intelligence (AI). Topological uncertainty refers to ambiguities in spatial and structural characteristics of medical features, which can impact the interpretation of coronary plaques. The article discusses the challenges of integrating AI with topological considerations and the need for specialized methodologies beyond traditional performance metrics. It highlights advancements in quantifying topological uncertainty, including the use of persistent homology and topological data analysis techniques. The importance of standardization in methodologies and ethical considerations in AI deployment are emphasized. It also outlines various types of uncertainty in topological frameworks for coronary plaques, categorizing them as quantifiable and controllable or quantifiable and not controllable. Future directions include developing AI algorithms that incorporate topological insights, establishing standardized protocols, and exploring ethical implications to revolutionize cardiovascular care through personalized treatment plans guided by sophisticated topological analysis. Recognizing and quantifying topological uncertainty in medical imaging as AI emerges is critical. Exploring topological uncertainty in coronary artery disease will revolutionize cardiovascular care, promising enhanced precision and personalization in diagnostics and treatment for millions affected by cardiovascular diseases.",Singh Y; Erickson B; Lopez-Jimenez F,Department of Radiology; Department of Cardiovascular Medicine,

The secondary objective was to assess the stability of TTs and the effect of management advice on changes in traits and health outcomes. Data from the Dutch asthma/COPD service (2007-2023) were studied retrospectively. Patients ≥18 years with asthma, COPD, or Asthma-COPD overlap (ACO) were included. The prevalence of eight TTs were assessed: 1) insufficient inhaler technique, 2) poor medication adherence, 3) blood eosinophilia, 4) smoking, 5) obesity, 6) physical inactivity, 7) reversible airflow limitation, and 8) anxiety and/or depression. The effect of management advice on TTs was evaluated for patients with a follow-up visit scheduled within 1-2 years. In total, 15246 patients (COPD n=4822; ACO n=1761, asthma n=8663) were included. The highest proportions of TTs were insufficient inhaler technique: 43.6% (95% CI: 42.9-44.4), followed by poor medication adherence: 40.3% (95% CI: 39.2-41.4) and blood eosinophilia: 36.9% (95% CI: 35.8-38.1). Overall, 83.3% of patients had ≥ 1 TTs, and 48.9% of patients ≥ 2 TTs. Among patients with blood eosinophilia, a significant reduction of the trait at follow-up (OR: 0.61, 95% CI: 0.39; 0.96) and improved health status were observed when the pulmonologist advised the general practitioner to initiate or increase the dose of ICS. No significant association was found between management advice and the exacerbation rate at follow-up. The TTs assessed in this study are common in primary care patients, with nearly half of the patients showing a combination of at least two TTs. These TTs coexist in many different combinations. A personalized approach targeting these traits may be effective in achieving better control of these heterogeneous diseases.",Meijer RJ,Ommelander Ziekenhuis Groningen (OZG),

Americas,10.1016/j.lana.2025.101090,"Chagas disease, caused by the protozoan parasite  We used RNA sequencing to analyse the gene expression changes in the peripheral blood of six patients with Chagas disease with early structural heart disease, four patients with Chagas disease without any signs or symptoms of disease, thirteen patients without Chagas disease with early structural heart disease, and ten patients without Chagas disease or signs of heart disease. Pathway analyses and immune cell deconvolution were employed to further elucidate the biological processes underlying early CCC development. Our analysis suggests that early CCC is associated with a downregulation of various peripheral immune response genes, including changes suggestive of reduced antigen presentation and T cell activation. Notably, these genes and processes appear to be distinct from those of non-Chagas cardiomyopathies. This work highlights the potential importance of the immune response in early CCC, providing insight into the early pathogenesis of this disease and how it may differ from other cardiomyopathies. The changes we have identified may serve as biomarkers of early CCC and could inform future longitudinal cohort studies of markers of disease progression and strategies for the treatment of CCC in its early stages.

Using a new statistical methodology, we explored the link between an inactivated quadrivalent influenza vaccine's impact on HI antibody titers and its effectiveness against A/H1N1-associated influenza illness. We utilized data from a phase 3, observer-blind, randomized, controlled trial in children aged 6-35 months to assess HI antibody titers as an immune CoP. The assessment used a statistical method developed within a causal inference framework and a new information-theoretic metric of surrogacy, the so-called individual causal association (ICA). The 75% and 85% uncertainty intervals of the ICA are 0.5511-0.8282 and 0.3632-0.8684, respectively, indicating a substantial reduction in the uncertainty about the vaccine's effect on the absence of infection when its impact on the HI antibody titers is known.

The full value of this approach will be realized by taking these processes to the production scale; however, achieving this goal will require a better understanding of the influence of mass transport on reaction behavior and the interactions between reactive species and electrodes inherent to organic electrosynthesis. The limited options for cell geometries used on small scale limit elucidation of these features. Here, we show how advanced cell geometries allow us to control the interplay between reaction mechanism and mass transport, leading to improved performance of three modern organic electrosynthetic reactions.

Thanks to its different techno-functional characteristics, such as solubility, emulsification, gelling and foaming, it has been widely exploited in food manufacturing. Also, advances in processing technologies have enabled the industrial production of a variety of whey-based products exerting biological activities. The beneficial properties of whey proteins (WPs) include their documented effects on cardiovascular, digestive, endocrine, immune and nervous systems, and their putative role in the prevention and treatment of non-communicable diseases (NCDs). In this regard, research on their application for health enhancement, based on the optimization of product formulation and the development of pharmaceuticals, is highly relevant. Beyond the health and nutritionally relevant effects as in in vivo animal studies, the allergenicity of WPs and WP hydrolysates is also herein tackled and discussed, as well as their potential role as therapeutics for immune tolerance and so-called tolerogenic effects. Grounded on the WPs' health-promoting functions, this paper presents the latest research showing the potential of whey-derived peptides as an alternative strategy in NCD treatment. This work also reports a careful analysis of their current use, also revealing which obstacles limit their full exploitation, thus highlighting the future challenges in the field.

The label incorporates recommended dosing for status epilepticus in children. Published population pharmacokinetic (PK) modeling recommends an intravenous bolus dose of 0.2 mg/kg capped at 8 mg to reach the suggested target exposure of 200-600 ng/mL at 10 min post dose in children up to 17 years of age. This model was developed for children generally without obesity based on IV data, and it is unclear how increased body weight may affect exposure or target attainment given capped dosing. Diazepam concentrations after IV or oral administration for 61 children aged 2.5 to 20.6 years were used to externally evaluate the model including the addition of fixed oral absorption parameters. Then, PK parameters were re-estimated with the external population alone and again in combination with the original population. Re-estimated parameters from the combined population were used to simulate recommended dosing for children with and without obesity. The external dataset included 88 plasma concentrations from 61 children (54 with obesity) receiving diazepam per standard of care. The external evaluation resulted in 34.5% of predicted values within 30% of the observed concentration. Parameter re-estimation resulted in increased central volume of distribution (26% increase from a previous model), reduced peripheral volume of distribution and intercompartmental clearance, and similar clearance estimates. Simulations demonstrated that dosing caps may prevent children with obesity from reaching the suggested target exposure that is recommended for the treatment of status epilepticus. Further study is needed to evaluate the target exposure range in this population.",Anderson SG; Payne EH; Turdalieva S; ,The Emmes Company; ,

Potassium-competitive acid blockers (P-CABs) are novel acid-suppressive drugs that have emerged as potential alternatives. We evaluated the effectiveness of P-CAB in reducing the risk of UGI bleeding in patients receiving DAPT after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). This retrospective cohort study included patients with PCI on DAPT between January 2019 and January 2023 using the Korean nationwide health claims database. The primary outcome was admission for UGI bleeding within 6 months of PCI. A multivariate Cox regression model was used to evaluate UGI bleeding risk based on PPIs and P-CAB use. Of the 210 447 patients who underwent PCI on DAPT (mean age, 65.5 years; 74.7% men), 4.6% and 47.5% patients were prescribed P-CABs and PPIs, respectively. Overall, 0.3% of patients experienced UGI bleeding within 6 months of PCI. P-CAB users had a reduced risk of UGI bleeding (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.59; 95% confidence interval, 0.38-0.92; p = 0.019) compared with patients not receiving P-CAB or PPI. No significant difference was observed between the P-CAB and PPI users (p > 0.05). Among Korean patients undergoing PCI with DAPT, P-CABs reduced UGI bleeding comparably to PPIs. These findings suggest that P-CABs are potential alternatives to PPIs for preventing UGI bleeding.",,,

This study aims to determine the barriers/facilitators to PDAC genetics care/surveillance among Black and Latino/a populations. This is a concurrent mixed-methods study that utilized electronic surveys and semi-structured focus groups/in-depth interviews (02/14/2022-12/21/2022). This was a volunteer sample of Black or Latino/a general participants with a personal or family history of PDAC and community leaders serving these groups. Participants discussed barriers/facilitators to PDAC cancer genetics care/surveillance. Health literacy, cancer worry, medical trust, and inherited cancer risk were assessed using electronic surveys. Discussions were recorded, transcribed, and analyzed using a content analysis approach. Chi-square tests, two-sample t-tests, and one-way analysis of variance were used to evaluate survey data using R v4.3.2. 55 participants (n = 27 general participants, 28 leaders) completed surveys. 27 (49%) self-identified as Black and 23 (42%) as Latino/a. Leaders (74%) reported higher levels of perceived medical mistrust among their communities than general participants (Trust in Physician Scale mean/SD 29.9/4.2 vs. 38.4/5.2, p < 0.001; Medical Mistrust Index = 18.8/4.2 vs. 24.4/3.6; p < 0.001, respectively). General participants self-reported higher digital health seeking capabilities than leaders' perception of that skillset (p < 0.001). 24 of these participants completed a focus group/in-depth interview, emphasizing informed discussions with a trusted/established provider. Individuals impacted by PDAC are open to genetics care and desire resources to promote PDAC surveillance.

A cost-utility analysis consisting of a decision tree and Markov cohort designed to calculate the difference in costs and health outcomes between two scenarios: (1) disease-modifying treatment (DMT) for SMA after diagnosis through NBS, and (2) DMT for SMA after diagnosis as symptoms appear. A population of 295,906 newborns was modeled, based on the total number of live births in Australia in 2023. Inputs included screening parameters, epidemiology inputs, SMA natural history data and DMT parameters (nusinersen and onasemnogene abeparvovec), costs, and health-related quality of life parameters. Assumed participation in NBS was 100%. A one-way sensitivity analysis and probabilistic sensitivity analysis were conducted to examine the impact of parameter uncertainty. There were 30 patients identified with SMA, of whom 25 patients would be eligible for presymptomatic treatment. NBS for SMA was dominant compared with no NBS for SMA. On a population level, NBS demonstrated a lifetime gain of 267 quality-adjusted life years (QALY) and incremental costs of -AUD$3,983,263 (i.e., cost savings). Every dollar invested in NBS would save hospitals $3.69. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses demonstrated the robustness of the base-case results. NBS for SMA was dominant compared with no NBS for SMA in Australia from a state and territory payer perspective.

Severe RIL has been associated with worse prognosis and survival, and recent studies suggested that RIL also affects immunotherapy efficacy. We aimed to develop murine grade 2 (≥20 % decrease in absolute lymphocyte counts (ALC)) RIL models and to examine the effects of RIL on progression-free survival upon radiotherapy-immunotherapy treatment. C57BL6/J mice received heart, large blood vessels (LBV) or thoracic vertebrae irradiation (10 Gy) and ALC were monitored weekly. In tumour-bearing animals, Lewis Lung Carcinoma cells were injected subcutaneously one day prior to RIL induction. When tumours reached 212 ± 45 mm Radiation treatment plans targeting lymphocyte-rich organs were optimized to achieve maximal target coverage while minimal dose to normal tissues. In naïve animals, LBV and vertebrae irradiation led to grade 2 RIL, however heart irradiation induced only grade 1 RIL. In tumour-bearing animals, RIL induction was confirmed by a 16 % and 20 % drop in ALC upon LBV and vertebrae irradiation, respectively. Grade 2 RIL did not negatively influence progression-free survival upon radiotherapy. Radiation combined with L19-IL2 induced a tumour growth delay compared to radiotherapy only (p < 0.0005). LBV or vertebrae irradiation did not affect radiotherapy-immunotherapy outcome, explained by the restored and increased lymphocyte and eosinophil counts upon L19-IL2 administration (p < 0.05). L19-IL2 increased inducible regulatory and CD8 Collectively, utilizing the developed murine RIL models, we observed that RIL did not negatively affect radiotherapy treatment outcome.

In Phase 3 trials, daridorexant significantly reduced polysomnography-determined wake after sleep onset (WASO) versus placebo, and rates of daytime somnolence were similar to placebo. This analysis examines the effect of daridorexant on WASO in each 2-h quarter (Q) of the night (8-h recording), and on next-morning sleepiness, daytime alertness and ability to function (assessed daily using visual analog scales [VAS]), and the correlation between these night and day assessments. Data from 930 patients with insomnia disorder randomized to daridorexant 50 mg (n = 310), 25 mg (n = 310) or placebo (n = 310) for 3 months were analyzed. At Month 1, daridorexant 25 mg and 50 mg significantly decreased WASO versus placebo in Q2 (least-square mean difference [LSMD] 25 mg: -4.7 min p < 0.0001; 50 mg: -7.1 min p < 0.0001), Q3 (LSMD 25 mg: -3.3 min p = 0.0086; 50 mg: -7.2 min p < 0.0001) and Q4 (LSMD 25 mg: -4.3 min p = 0.0055; 50 mg -8.5 min p < 0.0001). Results were similar at Month 3. VAS scores for next-morning sleepiness, daytime alertness and ability to function improved from Day 1 in all groups and continued to improve over time, with treatment numerically ranked as daridorexant 50 mg > 25 mg > placebo.

40288237,Quantifying temporal differences in the induction of interferon-mediated signalling observed in a dengue virus 1 human infection model: insights from longitudinal proteome analysis.,2025-05-16,EBioMedicine,10.1016/j.ebiom.2025.105728,"According to WHO, dengue is one of the top ten global health threats, with almost half of the world's population at risk of being infected. Most of the annual 400 million dengue virus (DENV) infections manifest asymptomatically or in a mild form, causing symptoms such as fever and headache. Nevertheless, every year 500,000 dengue cases require hospitalization and up to 25,000 patients die. Despite the high incidence, the DENV-elicited proteome response remains insufficiently understood. Therefore, we evaluated the proteome dynamics of nine dengue-naïve individuals experimentally infected with the underattenuated DENV-1 strain 45AZ5 via the Proximity Extension Assay technology of Olink®. Using Olink Explore, a total of ∼3000 proteins were quantified simultaneously in serum samples at 8, 10, 14, and 28 days after the viral inoculation. We identified the top ten significant proteins via linear mixed effects models, i.e., interferons (IFNs), IFN-related proteins, and members of the CCL and CXCL chemokine family. In all participants, an increase in IFN-λ1 levels was observed after peak viral load, whereas in one participant an IFN-γ response was not detected. Interestingly, both the onset and peak viral load of this participant were, on average, delayed 4 days compared to other participants. To gain a detailed kinetic overview of the DENV-elicited proteome response, we designed a smaller, targeted Olink® panel to evaluate serum protein levels at multiple time points throughout the infection. Here, we revealed that type I/III IFN response precedes the type II IFN response. In conclusion, our analyses provided detailed insights into the temporal dynamics of the different IFN responses upon a primary DENV-1 infection. These insights might aid in better understanding dengue pathogenesis.

Although the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries have relatively lower TB incidence rates, they face unique challenges, particularly with a large migrant workforce from TB-endemic regions. Understanding trends in TB burden in these countries is essential for guiding public health strategies. We analyzed TB trends in GCC countries from 1990 to 2021 using data from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study. Joinpoint regression assessed temporal trends, and ARIMA modeling was used to forecast future TB incidence, mortality, and DALYs. The metrics considered age-standardized mortality rates (ASMR), DALYs rate (ASDR), and incidence rates (ASIR). Data visualizations, including choropleth maps and trend graphs, were also created using R and MS Excel. From 1990-2021, TB incidence, mortality, and DALYs showed a steady decline across the GCC countries. The age-standardized mortality rate (ASMR) decreased by an average annual percentage change (AAPC) of -5.39 %, while the age-standardized DALYs rate (ASDR) decreased at a slightly higher rate of -5.50 %. Forecasting through 2031 predicts a continued decline: the age-standardized incidence rate (ASIR) will fall from 28.4 per 100,000 in 2022-5.4 by 2031, and mortality is expected to decline from 3.87 per 100,000 to 2.39 over the same period. DALYs are projected to decrease from 103.5 in 2022-62 by 2031. Countries like Qatar and Saudi Arabia showed significant improvements, with Qatar achieving a 95.56 % reduction in mortality. However, the UAE with a 61.18 % reduction in incidence and DALYs, showed a 26.71 % increase in mortality. TB control in GCC countries shows positive trends, reflecting successful public health interventions. However, challenges remain, particularly the high prevalence of TB among migrant populations. Continued efforts and tailored interventions are essential to sustain progress toward TB elimination.",,,akanand96@gmail.com.
40288221,Latest Advances in Perioperative care for Resectable Non-small lung cancer.,,Respiratory investigation,10.1016/j.resinv.2025.04.001,"Resectable non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has a relatively poor prognosis owing to the risk of developing local or distant metastatic recurrence, even at stage I. To overcome the high recurrence rate, perioperative therapies have been rapidly developed through the combination of existing cytotoxic chemotherapies with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) and molecular targeted therapies. These new therapeutic strategies have significantly improved the prognosis of patients with stage II-III NSCLC and have been approved for clinical use. However, new challenges have emerged in the selection of the optimal perioperative treatment in clinical practice. First, it is currently difficult to determine which perioperative treatment is superior, preoperative or postoperative. Additionally, since surgery alone is curative in some patients, the addition of anticancer agents such as ICIs raises concerns regarding toxicity, as serious side effects during preoperative treatment may lead to an inability to perform the surgery itself. Moreover, because various perioperative treatments are still being developed, treatment options for perioperative care are expected to increase soon. To summarize the increasingly complex perioperative treatment of resectable NSCLC, this review provides a comprehensive summary of the clinical efficacies of current perioperative therapies and future directions based on basic background, patient selection, ongoing trials, and enhancing immunotherapy.",,,yuko.oya.710@gmail.com.

Given CSL112's potential anti-inflammatory properties, we conducted an exploratory post hoc analysis to determine if its efficacy is influenced by baseline neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), a marker of systemic inflammation, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). The purpose of this study was to investigate the association of baseline NLR and cardiovascular events and explore whether NLR and LDL-C modify CSL112's efficacy in post-AMI patients. A total of 18,219 participants with AMI, multivessel coronary artery disease, and additional cardiovascular risk factors were randomized to 4 weekly infusions of 6 g CSL112 or placebo. The primary endpoint was a composite of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, or stroke (major adverse cardiovascular events [MACE]). Cox proportional hazards models evaluated risk by dichotomized baseline NLR (>median vs ≤median). Treatment interactions with NLR and LDL-C (≥100 vs <100 mg/dL) were assessed. Among 15,966 participants, those with baseline NLR >median (>3.3) had a significantly greater risk of MACE at 90 days (HR: 1.40; 95% CI: 1.21-1.63), persisting at 180 and 365 days. CSL112 reduced MACE at 90 days among participants with elevated NLR and LDL-C ≥100 mg/dL (HR: 0.63; 95% CI: 0.42-0.93), with sustained benefits at 180 and 365 days. Significant interactions were observed between treatment and NLR (P Baseline elevated NLR predicts MACE in post-AMI patients, and CSL112 showed an associated reduction in MACE in patients with elevated NLR and LDL-C ≥100 mg/dL.",Duffy D; Anschuetz G; Kingwell BA; Harrington RA; ,Weill Cornell Medicine; ; CSL Limited; CSL Behring,charlesmichaelgibson@gmail.com.
40287365,Brain photobiomodulation: a potential treatment in Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases.,,The journal of prevention of Alzheimer's disease,10.1016/j.tjpad.2025.100185,"Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and Parkinson's Disease (PD) are common neurodegenerative diseases, characterized by the progressive loss of synapses and neurons, leading to cognitive and motor decline. Their pathophysiology includes cerebral lesions, oxidative stress, neuroinflammation as well as brain-gut axis microbiota dysbiosis. Preclinical investigations demonstrated that brain photobiomodulation (bPBM) reduces oxidative stress and inflammation, increases cerebral blood flow and enhance neurogenesis and synaptogenesis, which makes bPBM a promising treatment in AD and PD. This review focuses on the clinical application of bPBM in AD and PD. It aims to provide a scientific overview of the current clinical knowledge, review recent clinical studies findings, and describe future directions and upcoming clinical studies. So far, several clinical studies investigated bPBM therapy, at various parameters, both in patients with AD and related dementia, and PD. All demonstrate bPBM safety and bring valuable clinical information regarding efficacy, with particularly promising results in AD. However, their exploratory design and inconsistent quality lead to a low level of evidence, which currently does not support the widespread use of bPBM in clinical practice. Future clinical research should address two gaps: the need for robust double-blinded RCTs vs sham with a higher number of patients and a longer follow-up, and the need for research focusing on dosimetry to determine which bPBM parameters are optimal. The ongoing or unpublished clinical studies on bPBM should fill in this gap.",Blivet G; Touchon B; Guillemin S; Moro C,REGEnLIFE SAS; CEA-Clinatec; RCTs,blivet_guillaume@yahoo.fr.
40287074,Quality by digital design to accelerate sustainable medicines development.,,International journal of pharmaceutics,10.1016/j.ijpharm.2025.125625,"We present a shared industry-academic perspective on the principles and opportunities for Quality by Digital Design (QbDD) as a framework to accelerate medicines development and enable regulatory innovation for new medicines approvals. This approach exploits emerging capabilities in industrial digital technologies to achieve robust control strategies assuring product quality and patient safety whilst reducing development time/costs, improving research and development efficiency, embedding sustainability into new products and processes, and promoting supply chain resilience. Key QbDD drivers include the opportunity for new scientific understanding and advanced simulation and model-driven, automated experimental approaches. QbDD accelerates the identification and exploration of more robust design spaces. Opportunities to optimise multiple objectives emerge in route selection, manufacturability and sustainability whilst assuring product quality. Challenges to QbDD adoption include siloed data and information sources across development stages, gaps in predictive capabilities, and the current extensive reliance on empirical knowledge and judgement. These challenges can be addressed via QbDD workflows; model-driven experimental design to collect and structure findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable (FAIR) data; and chemistry, manufacturing and control ontologies for shareable and reusable knowledge. Additionally, improved product, process, and performance predictive tools must be developed and exploited to provide a holistic end-to-end development approach.",Cottini C; Henson M; Hidber P; Langston M; Mantanus J; Quist PO; Reynolds GK; Rowland M; Thorat AA,Sustainable Innovation & Transformational Excellence (xSITE); F.

We aimed to assess the risk and describe the characteristics of children with recurrent IPD over a 12-year period covering the introduction of the 7-valent (PCV7), followed by the 13-valent (PCV13) pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) in the national childhood immunisation programme in England. We used enhanced national surveillance data for England and included all laboratory-confirmed IPD cases in children (<15 years) during 2006/07-2017/18. We assessed the risk and rate of recurrent IPD, the serotypes responsible and the demographics, comorbidity status and prevalence, vaccination status, clinical presentation and outcomes in children with recurrent IPD compared to those with a single IPD episode. There were 5158 IPD episodes reported in 5033 children over 12 years and 2.2% (105/4814) of those surviving their first IPD had at least one recurrence. Recurrence risk decreased with increasing age and over time. During 2015/16-2017/18, five years after PCV13 replaced PCV7, IPD recurrence rate was 229.0 (95% CI 154.8-339.0) per 100,000 person-years, with all recurrent cases caused by non-PCV13 serotypes. Where serotype information was available, recurrence was due to the same serotype in 25 cases, with a shorter median (IQR) interval of 88 (57-177) days between recurrent episodes, and in 60 cases due to different serotypes, with a median (IQR) interval of 223 (125-574) days (p=0.001). Compared to healthy children (103.0; 95%CI 63.1-168.1), recurrence rate per 100,000 person-years was 10 times higher in children with any comorbidity (1061.0; 95% CI 827.2-1360.9; 62/78 [79.5%] with available information had comorbidities), and almost 30 times higher in immunosuppressed children (2788.5; 95%CI 2029.0-3832.2; 38/78 [48.7%] were immunosuppressed). The 30-day case-fatality rate after recurrent IPD was 2.9% (3/105) compared to 4.4% (219/4928; p=0.63) after single-episode IPD. Recurrent IPD is rare in children and occurs mainly in children with comorbidities, especially immunosuppression.

Understanding the clinical characteristics of drug-induced IP in Japan will facilitate accurate diagnosis of the disease. The aim of this study was to analyze and report the clinical characteristics of drug-induced IP in Japan. We analyzed the characteristics of drug-induced IP diagnosed between 2009 and 2022 in Japan. Case data were collated with the cooperation of pharmaceutical companies, as requested by the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare. We identified 285 patients with drug-induced IP diagnosed in medical institutions. The most common causative drugs identified were antineoplastic agents (56.1 %). Common subjective symptoms included dyspnea (158 patients [55.4 %]), cough (132 patients [46.3 %]), and fever (115 patients [40.4 %]). In addition, 177 patients (73.1 % of those measured) showed elevated serum KL-6, SP-D, or SP-A levels. Approximately 60 % of the patients developed IP within 90 days from the initiation of drug therapy, whereas 15 % developed the disease after >1 year. Regarding imaging findings, 249 patients (87.4 %) showed bilateral shadows. Corticosteroid therapy was administered to 222 patients (77.9 %). The treatment outcomes of drug-induced IP in Japan were favorable, with improvement observed in 273 patients (95.8 %). Dyspnea, cough, and fever after administration of a drug; elevated serum KL-6, SP-D, and SP-A levels; and bilateral shadows were identified as clinical features of drug-induced IP in Japan.

Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is a potential therapeutic option for DLB, but its efficacy and safety remain uncertain. We systematically reviewed articles on ECT for DLB, including those published in Japanese-language journals, and surveyed institutions certified by the Japanese Psychogeriatric Society. Of 41 peer-reviewed articles, 32 were from Japan. The proportion of prodromal DLB cases was significantly higher in Japan (34.8 %) than in other countries (9.5 %) (p = 0.044). Cardiac [123I]-metaiodobenzylguanidine scintigraphy and/or striatal dopamine transporter imaging were significantly more frequently in Japan (71.8 %) than in other countries (5.5 %) (p < 0.001). ECT has shown effectiveness in treating depression, catatonia, agitation and psychosis. It was generally considered safe, with transient delirium being the most common side effect, occurring in 16.1 % of Japanese cases. However, current evidence is limited to case studies and lacks randomized controlled trials. The survey confirmed that ECT is widely performed for DLB in Japan, although the number of cases treated varied greatly across institutions. These findings underscore the need for standardized ECT guidelines for DLB. Multicenter studies with standardized assessments and longitudinal follow-up are essential to further research on ECT for DLB, including psychiatric-onset prodromal DLB.",,,fujishiro17@hotmail.co.jp.

Enzymatic hydrolysis is particularly noteworthy because of its mild conditions and its efficacy in producing peptides with various biological activities. This study focused on creating whey protein hydrolysates using three enzymes: pepsin, trypsin, and papain. The degree of hydrolysis and the antioxidant properties of the resulting peptides were evaluated, and papain demonstrated the highest degree of hydrolysis, leading to its selection for further investigation. LC-MS was employed to identify peptide sequences from the papain-derived hydrolysate, resulting in the identification of 107 distinct peptide sequences These peptides were predicted to exhibit a range of potential biological activities, including antihypertensive, antidiabetic, antioxidant, antimicrobial, and immunomodulatory effects, as well as roles in regulating glucose homeostasis, maintaining cardiovascular health, and supporting overall metabolic function. In vitro tests revealed the significant antioxidant and antibacterial properties of the hydrolysate, confirming the potential of papain-derived peptides for use in functional food and pharmaceutical applications.

However, it is unclear which neurophysiological processes contribute to impairments in implementing various strategies to down-regulate negative emotion. The current study used electroencephalography (EEG) to determine whether individuals at CHR have difficulty implementing reappraisal and distraction. Participants included individuals at CHR (n = 25) and healthy controls (CN: n = 36) who completed an EEG task while unpleasant or neutral stimuli were presented and they were required to either passively view or down-regulate negative emotion using reappraisal or distraction. The late positive potential (LPP) event related potential component was calculated from the EEG data and used as an objective neurophysiological indicator of emotion regulation effectiveness. CN effectively decreased the amplitude of the LPP for both reappraisal and distraction compared with unpleasant passive viewing; however, CHR did not differ in LPP amplitude for unpleasant passive viewing, reappraisal, and distraction, suggesting an implementation abnormality. Difficulty implementing distraction was associated with greater severity of attenuated positive symptoms. Collectively, these findings suggest that CHR display neurophysiological patterns of emotion regulation impairment that are similar to those that have been identified among individuals with schizophrenia in past studies. Interventions have been developed to target these mechanisms. It may be beneficial to apply these interventions to psychosis-spectrum populations where they would have relevance for both treatment of established symptoms and prevention of illness among those at CHR.",,,gstrauss@uga.edu.

As a glucocorticoid, BUD prevents the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines/chemokines and the recruitment of immune cells into the inflamed mucosa. However, emerging evidence indicates that BUD, unlike classical glucocorticoids, is also a potent modulator of stem and cancer cell behavior/plasticity. Certainly, BUD stabilizes cell-cell adhesions, preventing embryonic stem cell differentiation and inhibiting the development of 3D gastruloids. In addition, BUD inhibits the motile/invasive propensity of different cancer cells, including breast, lung, and pancreatic cancer. Finally, it prevents the infection of positive single-stranded human-infecting RNA viruses such as SARS-CoV-2. At a molecular level, BUD induces epigenetic changes and modifies the transcriptome of epithelial, stem, and cancer cells, providing molecular support to the immune cell-independent activity of BUD. Here, we performed an in-depth review of these unexpected activities of BUD, identified by unbiased drug screening programs, and we emphasize the molecular mechanisms modulated by this efficacious drug that deserve further research.",,,

This study explores enhancing membrane protein production in these cells by deleting the C-terminal of the ATF6B gene using CRISPR-Cas9 technology. The objective of this research is to investigate the effect of C-terminal deletion of the ATF6B gene on membrane protein production in HEK293T cells using CRISPR-Cas9 technology. To identify effective gene targets, sgRNAs were initially designed against multiple UPR-related genes, including ATF6A, IRE1A, IRE1B, PERK, and ATF6B. Among them, ATF6B was selected as the primary target for further investigation due to its superior editing efficiency. The efficiency of sgRNAs was evaluated using the T7E1 assay, and sequencing was performed to verify gene editing patterns. Membrane proteins were extracted from both ATF6B C-terminally deleted (ATF6B-ΔC) and wild-type (WT) cell lines for comparison. Flow cytometry was employed to assess membrane protein production by analyzing GFP expression in Membrane-GFP-expressing cells. HEK293T cells with C-terminally deleted ATF6B (ATF6B-ΔC) significantly increased membrane protein production by approximately 40 ± 17.6% compared to WT cells (",Kim BR,Translational Research Team,
40281717,In Vitro-In Silico Approach in the Development of Clopidogrel Solid Dispersion Formulations.,,"Bioengineering (Basel, Switzerland)",10.3390/bioengineering12040357,"The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of solid dispersion (SD) formulation factors on improvement of the bioavailability and pharmacokinetic profile of clopidogrel after peroral administration using an in vitro-in silico approach. A clopidogrel-specific, physiologically based biopharmaceutical model (PBBM) was developed and validated to predict absorption and distribution of clopidogrel after peroral administration of the tested formulations. Clopidogrel solid dispersions were prepared using two polymers (poloxamer 407 and copovidone) and a drug-to-polymer ratio of 1:5 and 1:9. The results of the in vitro dissolution test under pH-media change conditions showed that the type and ratio of polymers notably influenced the release of clopidogrel from the SDs. It can be observed that an increase in the polymer content in the SDs leads to a decrease in the release of clopidogrel from the SDs. The predictive power of the constructed clopidogrel-specific PBBM was demonstrated by comparing the simulation results with pharmacokinetic data from the literature. The in vitro dissolution data were used as inputs for the PBBM to predict the pharmacokinetic profiles of clopidogrel after the peroral administration of SDs. SDs with copovidone (1:5) and poloxamer (1:9) showed the potential to achieve the highest drug absorption and bioavailability, with an improvement of over 100% compared to an immediate-release (IR) tablet. The sample with poloxamer (1:9) may have the potential to reduce inter-individual variability in clopidogrel pharmacokinetics due to absorption in the cecum and colon and associated lower first-pass metabolism in the liver. This suggests that distal intestine may be the targeted delivery site for clopidogrel, leading to improved absorption and bioavailability of the drug. This study has shown that an in vitro-in silico approach could be a useful tool for the development and optimization of clopidogrel formulations, helping in decision making regarding the composition of the formulation to achieve the desired pharmacokinetic profile.",,,
40281504,Qualitative analysis and exploration of anti-inflammatory and antibacterial effects of a Thai traditional medicine formula from Wat Pho beyond its use for COVID-19 treatment.,2025-04-26,BMC complementary medicine and therapies,10.1186/s12906-025-04873-3,"Ya-Kao (YK) is a traditional Thai medicine used to relieve fever and consists of 14 crude drugs. It has been recommended by Thai folk healers and the Department of Thai Traditional and Alternative Medicine for COVID-19 treatment, with clinical studies conducted to assess its efficacy. However, scientific evidence on its biological properties remains limited. This study aims to explore the quality aspect of YK and evaluate its antibacterial and anti-inflammatory effects. The quality aspect of the YK formula was assessed using high-performance thin-layer chromatography (HPTLC). Agar disc diffusion and TLC bioautography were used for antibacterial activity, while anti-inflammatory effects were evaluated by measuring nitric oxide (NO) production in LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 macrophages. The HPTLC method, utilizing a developing system of toluene, ethyl acetate, and formic acid (70:30:1, v/v/v), was successfully developed for the authentication of YK crude drugs. This method provides the most distinct fingerprint pattern of the components within the YK formulation, enabling clear visualization of its constituent. Additionally, it enables preliminary identification of phenolics, terpenes, and steroids, providing valuable insight into the formulation's chemical composition. The antibacterial activity of YK was evaluated using the disk diffusion assay, and it was found that the lime juice extract of the YK formula (LYK) exhibited the largest zone of inhibition against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial strains, particularly those pathogenic to the respiratory tract. Additionally, the antibacterial activity was evaluated using TLC bioautography, and the results indicated that the methanolic extract of YK (MYK) exhibited an inhibition zone against Streptococcus pyogenes and Klebsiella pneumoniae. It was found that several compounds displayed an inhibition zone. Furthermore, the YK extract with methanol, water, and lime juice exhibited significant anti-inflammatory properties by suppressing NO accumulation in LPS-stimulated macrophage cells (p < 0.05). This study is the first to standardize YK raw materials using HPTLC and evaluate the biological properties of each crude drug and the combined formula. The developed HPTLC method ensures accurate identification of YK raw materials, preventing the use of incorrect ingredients. Additionally, the pharmacological findings confirm YK's anti-inflammatory and antibacterial activities, particularly against respiratory pathogens linked to COVID-19.",Sanookpan K,Nabsolute Company Limited,sornkanok.v@pharm.chula.ac.th.

The control of its dosage in conventional release tablets requires the analytical validation of its method to ensure accurate quantification and provide confidence in the reliability of the results for informed decision-making. This study aims to validate an innovative method for Azithromycin quantification using the accuracy profile. Additionally, a comparison is made between the uncertainty measurements calculated from the validation data using two formulas proposed by Feinberg et al. and Saffaj & Ihssane and contrasted with the ISO GUM approach. A liquid chromatography system intended for Azithromycin analysis equipped with a reversed-phase C18 stationary phase consisting of octadecyl silyl vinyl polymer in a UV detector operating at 210 nm at a temperature of 40 °C in isocratic elution using a mobile phase of acetonitrile and dipotassium hydrogen phosphate buffer (6.7 g/L), in the fraction of (60:40, v/v) at pH = 8. The various accuracy profiles are illustrated to ensure that a known quantity of anticipated findings acquired through the method stand inside the tolerance interval of 95% and remain within the previously set acceptance limits of ± 5%. Measurement uncertainty provides comparable values using both formulas of the total error approach. However, it was observed that the ISO-GUM approach tends to overestimate the expanded uncertainty. Specifically, while the ISO-GUM approach provides a rigorous framework, the use of the validation data offers a more empirical uncertainty estimation. The approach based on the total error grants the ability to accurately close the routine uncertainty, emphasizing a complete validation. The proposed method is robust for pharmaceutical application, demonstrating good accuracy, with 95% of tolerance and uncertainty limits falling within the predefined acceptance limits of ± 5%.",Bamou NI,Dioma Pharmaceutical Manufacturing Company,

We investigated whether validated scales measuring apathy severity capture the three dimensions of the DCA-NCD (diminished initiative, diminished interest, diminished emotional expression). Degree of mapping (""not at all"", ""weakly"", or ""strongly"") between items on two commonly used apathy scales, the Neuropsychiatric Inventory-Clinician (NPI-C) apathy and Apathy Evaluation Scale (AES), with the DCA-NCD overall and its 3 dimensions was evaluated by survey. Survey participants, either experts (n = 12, DCA-NCD authors) or scientific community members (n = 19), rated mapping for each item and mean scores were calculated. Interrater reliability between expert and scientific community members was assessed using Cohen's kappa. According to experts, 9 of 11 (81.8%) NPI-C apathy items and 6 of 18 (33.3%) AES items mapped strongly onto the DCA-NCD overall. For the scientific community group, 10 of 11 (90.9%) NPI-C apathy items and 7 of 18 (38.8%) AES items mapped strongly onto the DCA-NCD overall. The overall mean mapping scores were higher for the NPI-C apathy compared to the AES for both expert (t (11) = 3.13, p = .01) and scientific community (t (17) = 3.77, p = .002) groups. There was moderate agreement between the two groups on overall mapping for the NPI-C apathy (kappa= 0.74 (0.57, 1.00)) and AES (kappa= 0.63 (0.35, 1.00)).

We used the 2016-2019 U.S. Nationwide Readmissions Database (NRD) to examine the association between RA diagnosis and 90-day readmission and in-hospital mortality risk during the 90-day readmission after index HF hospitalization. We performed multivariable-adjusted logistic regression, adjusting for patient demographics, Deyo-Charlson comorbidity index, median household income for patient's ZIP code, primary expected payer, patient state residency status, teaching status of hospital, hospital control, and hospital bed size. We calculated adjusted odds ratios (aOR) and 95 % confidence intervals (95 % CI).

Advances in MRI and genetic diagnostics now allow most patients to receive a genetic diagnosis, and emerging treatments are shifting the field from therapeutic nihilism to cautious optimism. Allogenic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), used since the 1980s, has shown efficacy in specific leukodystrophies, such as adrenoleukodystrophy and metachromatic leukodystrophy, when administered early. Gene therapy has become a viable option, with ex vivo approaches like atidarsagene autotemcel providing promising outcomes for early-onset MLD. Trials for gene replacement and antisense oligonucleotide therapies are ongoing for several leukodystrophies, including Canavan disease and Alexander disease. Certain treatments, such as guanabenz for Vanishing White Matter, target disease-specific dysregulated molecular pathways. Despite these advances, challenges remain, including the ultrarare nature of most leukodystrophies, limited natural history data, high treatment costs, and barriers to accessibility.

40279576,The Role of Digital Opinion Leaders in Dengue Prevention Through Health Promotion and Public Health Collaboration: Qualitative Semistructured Interview Study.,2025-04-26,Journal of medical Internet research,10.2196/70997,"Dengue fever is a significant public health concern. The advent of social media has introduced digital opinion leaders (DOLs), health care professionals with substantial online followings who play a pivotal role in disseminating health information and combating misinformation. We aimed to investigate the role of DOLs in dengue prevention and explore their preferences for collaboration with health sector entities to strengthen dengue prevention initiatives. A qualitative study was conducted using semistructured interviews with 37 purposively selected DOLs from 8 countries in Latin America and Southeast Asia. They were selected based on their active online presence, dissemination of dengue-related content, and substantial social media followings. Interviews took place either in person or online, according to the participants' chosen languages. Each session, lasting approximately 60 minutes, was audio recorded, transcribed verbatim, and subjected to thematic analysis to identify recurring themes. The thematic analysis led to several key findings. First, DOLs used social media to enhance public health communication, focusing on raising awareness (16/37, 43%), correcting misconceptions (17/37, 46%), and modeling preventive behaviors (8/37, 22%) for infectious diseases. They educated audiences on disease symptoms and prevention, addressed vaccine hesitancy, and shared personal practices to encourage similar actions among followers. Second, 35% (13/37) of the DOLs reported a widespread lack of public knowledge about dengue and its prevention, with even less awareness of vaccine availability. In addition, 27% (10/37) of them identified challenges due to antivaccination sentiments and misinformation, while 8% (3/37) noted obstacles from perceived inadequate government leadership in dengue prevention. In response, DOLs leveraged their social media influence to educate the public. A significant number (22/37, 59%) of the DOLs emphasized the importance of regular promotion of vector control measures as the cornerstone of dengue prevention and 68% (25/37) highlighted the critical role of vaccines, particularly among vulnerable groups. Finally, collaboration was essential for expanding DOLs' reach and credibility, with 54% (20/37) of them partnering with pharmaceutical companies, 43% (16/37) with government agencies, and 27% (10/37) with nongovernmental organizations. In these collaborations, 38% (14/37) of the DOLs emphasized the importance of adhering to ethical standards, and 57% (21/37) prioritized projects aligning with their personal values and professional standards, avoiding producing content that contradicted their beliefs or goals. DOLs are essential in disseminating dengue prevention information. They recognize their responsibility to raise awareness about dengue vaccines and dispel related misconceptions to combat vaccine hesitancy. Unlike nonmedical social media influencers, whose content may lack medical accuracy and be driven by monetization, DOLs provide evidence-based information, enhancing their credibility. Collaborations between DOLs and health sector stakeholders, although currently limited, hold significant potential for effective dengue prevention, provided they adhere to ethical standards and are supported by credible scientific evidence.",Green A; Wu S; Di Pasquale A,IQVIA Real World Solutions Asia-Pacific; Regional Medical Affairs Vaccines,

Treatment guidance for topical therapy (the mainstay of AD management), with particular consideration of emerging treatments, may further improve patient care. Here, we aim to provide healthcare professionals with AD treatment recommendations from the perspective of 10 Canadian dermatologists with expertise in managing AD. The panel of dermatologists conducted a systematic literature review and leveraged their clinical experience to develop generally accepted principles, consensus statements, and a treatment algorithm using an iterative consensus process. The panel collectively developed six generally accepted principles, 10 consensus statements, and a treatment algorithm. The guidance notes that assessment of disease severity should encompass both physician-rated measures and patient-reported outcomes. Disease education, lifestyle-based strategies (e.g., trigger avoidance), and supportive measures (e.g., moisturizers) can help reduce signs and symptoms of AD. Choice of therapy should consider disease-, patient-, and treatment-related factors. Although topical corticosteroids (TCS) are often used as first-line treatment in AD, they should be limited to intermittent short-term use. Noncorticosteroid topical therapies (e.g., topical calcineurin inhibitors; topical phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitors; and topical Janus kinase inhibitors) can be used for widespread involvement of AD according to approved use. Once treatment goals are achieved, noncorticosteroid topical maintenance therapy should continue to prevent flares and reduce the need for TCS. Guidance reflecting the benefits and limitations of topical AD treatments in conjunction with patient understanding of treatment goals supports robust shared decision-making in the management of AD.",Gooderham MJ; Papp KA; Ringuet J; Turchin I,Centre de Recherche Dermatologique du Québec Métropolitain; SKiN Centre for Dermatology; Probity Medical Research,mgooderham@centrefordermatology.com.

Recent research indicates that RSV may be underdiagnosed, especially in adult populations. This study aims to investigate the burden of RSV in hospitalized adults. A retrospective, matched-control cohort study covering the seasons 2011/2012 to 2021/2022 was performed on the basis of anonymized claims data from 6 million individuals in multiple German statutory health funds. Analyses comprise hospitalized persons aged 18+ years. Patients with RSV were identified using the International Classification of Diseases, tenth revision, German Modification (ICD-10-GM) codes directly related to RSV (narrow approach) and indirectly related to RSV (ICD-10-GM codes covering lower respiratory tract infections, broad approach). Comparing these cohorts can provide a reasonable estimate of upper and lower bounds. For patients with a secondary inpatient diagnosis of RSV, we evaluated mortality rates, lengths of stay (LOS), costs, special fees, intensive care unit (ICU) admission rates, ventilation rates, and use of high-flow oxygen. Cohorts were matched with controls using an 1:1 exact matching approach using age, sex, Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI, excluding age), main inpatient diagnosis, and quarter/year of admission. Mortality rates were between 15.5 (standard deviation, SD 1.031) and 19.8 (SD 0.070) times higher for patients with secondary inpatient diagnosis of RSV compared with their controls. Average LOS was 1.77 (SD 0.007) times longer than in controls, and healthcare costs were between 5600 EUR (SD 132.81) and 8400 EUR (SD 2313.54) higher for patients with RSV. No significant differences were found between patients with RSV and controls with respect to rehospitalization rate, invasive ventilation rate, or high-flow oxygen rate; however, patients indirectly related to RSV were admitted more often to intensive care (10.54% versus 3.25%). Our study provides a deeper understanding of how RSV secondary diagnosis affects hospitalized patients, finding that RSV infection dramatically increases mortality rate, LOS, and inpatient healthcare costs.

Equivalent efficacy and comparable safety of GP2015 to reference etanercept (ref-ETN) was demonstrated in two phase III studies, one in patients with moderate-to-severe chronic plaque-type psoriasis (PsO; EGALITY study) and the other in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA; EQUIRA study). EGALITY also included patients with reported psoriatic arthritis (PsA). Here, patient-reported outcome (PRO) data from both studies are presented. EGALITY included 531 patients with PsO and EQUIRA included 376 patients with RA. In EGALITY, patients who had achieved ≥ 50% improvement in Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) at week 12 either continued the initial treatment or underwent three treatment switches between GP2015 and ref-ETN starting at week 12.

This retrospective study focused on patients treated with complex-free (incobotulinumtoxinA) and complex-containing (onabotulinumtoxinA and abobotulinumtoxinA) BoNT/A formulations over an up to 10-year period. The novel dose-effect parameter ""DEff"" was introduced to quantify the relationship between dose adjustments and clinical outcomes, enabling the identification of partial treatment failures. The primary endpoint was a comparison of a clinically meaningful worsening in DEff in treatment year 7 compared to year 2 between complex-free and complex-containing botulinum neurotoxin type A. The RELY-CD study provides unique insights into long-term treatment patterns, clinical resistance phenomena, and the implications of formulation differences on treatment outcomes, addressing a critical gap in the literature on real-world botulinum neurotoxin type A application.

Evaluating MSL performance is critical for demonstrating their value, yet defining appropriate key performance indicators (KPIs) remains challenging due to the combination of scientific engagement, relationship-building, and other activities that are difficult to measure. This study examines the current and perceived ideal use of quantitative and qualitative metrics for MSL performance evaluation, the difficulties in measuring MSL impact, and the perceived effectiveness of existing KPIs. A global survey of 1023 medical affairs professionals across 63 countries was conducted, gathering data on which KPIs are currently used versus which should be used, the preferred weighting of qualitative vs. quantitative metrics, and opinions on measurement difficulty and KPI effectiveness. The results reveal a strong preference for qualitative metrics (52%) over quantitative metrics (7%), though most organizations primarily use activity-based metrics such as the number of key opinion leader (KOL) engagements (92%). Despite these practices, many respondents believe that MSL KPIs should focus more on impact-based qualitative metrics, such as the quality of KOL/HCP relationships and/or engagements (70%) and the quality of actionable insights gathered (67%). Furthermore, 67% of participants reported it is ""difficult"" or ""very difficult"" to measure MSL performance accurately, and only 3% revealed current KPIs and metrics used to measure MSL performance are ""very effective"". These findings highlight a disconnect between the way MSLs are evaluated and the value they provide. This study demonstrates the need for a balanced KPI framework that integrates both qualitative and quantitative measures. A more refined performance evaluation system (incorporating stakeholder feedback, insight quality, and strategic impact) can ensure fair assessments and drive MSL effectiveness.",Dyer S; Hyder C; Kraemer J,Syneos Health; Medical Science Liaison Society,

Recurrent or metastatic ACC has very limited therapeutic options. Cyclin-dependent kinase 9 (CDK9) is a key factor in the oncogenic transcriptional regulatory network, and inhibition of CDK9 may prove beneficial in MYC-dependent tumors such as ACC. A first-in-human, phase I, two-part dose-escalation and -expansion clinical trial (NCT04718675) enrolled patients with advanced solid tumors reliant on transcription factor activation to receive KB-0742, an oral selective inhibitor of CDK9. The primary endpoint was to establish safety/tolerability while nominating a recommended phase II dose (RP2D). Secondary endpoints included characterization of pharmacokinetics and assessment of preliminary efficacy. Among 19 patients with ACC enrolled in dose expansion at the RP2D (60 mg orally 3 days on and 4 days off each week during a 28-day cycle), the regimen was well tolerated with mild gastrointestinal toxicity and fatigue; a single grade 3 treatment-related adverse event was observed (elevated γ-glutamyl transferase). One patient discontinued for gastrointestinal toxicity. Although no responses were observed, nine of 16 (56%) eligible patients had stable disease, with four experiencing >6 months of stability. Six-month progression-free survival was 37% (95% confidence interval, 14.2-59.8). Most patients had the more indolent type II ACC phenotype and 10 (53%) had MYB alterations. This dose-expansion cohort exploring the novel CDK9 inhibitor KB-0742 in patients with advanced ACC established favorable tolerability at the RP2D. Disease stabilization was observed in some patients despite a limited efficacy signal. A first-in-human, phase I trial explored the safety and preliminary efficacy of the CDK9 inhibitor KB-0742 in patients with advanced, transcription factor-dependent solid tumors including ACC.

Training itself enhances insulin sensitivity in horses, similar to the improvements in performance capacity observed in human athletes. This study aimed to investigate whether aleurone supplementation provides additional benefits to training by modulating insulin metabolism and gut microbiota in Standardbred mares. Sixteen Standardbred mares (aged 3-5 years) participated in a cross-over study with two 8-week training periods separated by 8 weeks of detraining. Each horse received either 200 g/day aleurone supplementation or a control diet. Insulin metabolism was evaluated using oral (OGTT) and intravenous (FSIGTT) glucose tolerance tests, measuring parameters such as Maximum Training alone: Training significantly improved OGTT parameters by decreasing Maximum Aleurone supplementation enhances training-induced improvements in glucose metabolism and fecal microbiota composition, which could offer potential benefits for equine athletes by optimizing metabolic flexibility. It also supports improvements in glucose and insulin dynamics, particularly by further enhancing insulin sensitivity and glucose-mediated disposal.

The impact of the EU HTAR on diverse national HTA frameworks was explored in a three-country case study. Recommendations were developed to leverage strengths and address weaknesses to ensure consistent and cohesive vaccine assessments. The case study revealed potential overlaps between NITAGs and the EU HTAR, particularly regarding horizon scanning and joint scientific consultations. The involvement of NITAGs in national assessments varies, influencing how well joint clinical assessment reports will ultimately align with and be applicable to individual Member States. Stronger consideration of vaccines within the EU HTAR and NITAG involvement can streamline assessments, reduce duplication, and improve alignment between European and national processes.

However, there are few commonly used suicide screeners that also identify other mental health (MH) problems. A new, electronically administered instrument, the K-CAT, screens for suicide and multiple MH problems. We hypothesized that the K-CAT would enhance suicide identification compared with routine screening and identify significant anxiety and depression in youth presenting with non-MH chief complaints. This observational study was conducted in 2 PEDs. Eligible youth were 7 to 17 accompanied by a caregiver without: severe medical concerns, difficult behaviors, limited verbal language, or only a psychiatric complaint. Of the 341 eligible, 241 (70.7%) were screened, and 228 both presented with a non-MH problem and had complete K-CAT data. A Fisher exact test determined whether suicidal behaviors/ideation rates differed between the K-CAT and retrospective chart review data. Seventy-four or 32.46% of youth scored positive for suicide, anxiety, and/or depression on the K-CAT. Females were more likely to screen positive (P<0.001). Compared with the retrospective data, more youth were identified with suicide risk by the K-CAT (3.95% vs. 0%; P=0.004). Youth identified by the K-CAT were 62.5% female and 33.3% 7 to 11 years. The K-CAT increases the identification of suicidal ideation and behaviors overall and in younger children.

A sizable number of patients do not respond to first-line treatments. Non-invasive neuromodulation is a second-line treatment approach, but current methods rely on cortical targets to indirectly modulate subcortical structures, e.g., the amygdala, implicated in MATRDs. Low-intensity transcranial focused ultrasound (tFUS) is a non-invasive technique for direct subcortical neuromodulation, but its safety, feasibility, and promise as a potential treatment is largely unknown. In a target engagement study, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-guided tFUS to the left amygdala was administered during functional MRI (tFUS/fMRI) to test for acute modulation of blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) signal in a double-blind, within-subject, sham-controlled design in patients with MATRDs (N = 29) and healthy comparison subjects (N = 23). In an unblinded treatment trial, the same patients then underwent 3-week daily (15 sessions) MRI-guided repetitive tFUS (rtFUS) to the left amygdala to examine safety, feasibility, symptom change, and change in amygdala reactivity to emotional faces. Active vs. sham tFUS/fMRI reduced, on average, left amygdala BOLD signal and produced patient-related differences in hippocampal and insular responses. rtFUS was well-tolerated with no serious adverse events. There were significant reductions on the primary outcome (Mood and Anxiety Symptom Questionnaire General Distress subscale; p = 0.001, Cohen's d = 0.77), secondary outcomes (Cohen's d of 0.43-1.50), and amygdala activation to emotional stimuli. Findings provide initial evidence of tFUS capability to modulate amygdala function, rtFUS safety and feasibility in MATRDs, and motivate double-blind randomized controlled trials to examine efficacy.ClinicalTrials.gov registration: NCT05228964.",,,gfonzo@austin.utexas.edu.

Of these symptoms, deficits in motivation and pleasure, especially in the domain of avolition, are particularly disabling. Effects of inflammation on motivational deficits in patients with depression are associated with disruptions in corticostriatal reward circuitry involving the inferior ventral striatum (iVS) and ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC). Accordingly, we examined the relationships among inflammation, negative symptoms, and corticostriatal reward circuitry in patients with schizophrenia. Negative symptoms and high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) were obtained in 57 individuals with schizophrenia.

However, metabolic reprogramming has emerged as a key driver of GB progression and invasiveness. This study presents a rare case of recurrent GB with scalp metastasis, exploring how metabolic shifts enable GB cells to evade treatment and adapt to hostile environments, offering insights for developing innovative therapies. Tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) was employed to analyze amino acid profiles in both the recurrent and metastatic stages of GB. Systems biology approaches were used to uncover genetic alterations and metabolic reprogramming associated with the progression from recurrence to metastasis. Our analysis revealed distinct amino acid utilization patterns in a patient with a molecular phenotype of wild-type IDH-1&2, TERT mutation, non-mutated BRAF and EGFR, and non-methylated MGMT. During recurrence and metastasis, significant differences in amino acid profiles were observed between blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples. Additionally, protein-protein interaction (PPI) analysis identified key genomic drivers potentially responsible for the transition from recurrent to metastatic GB. Beyond established risk factors such as craniotomy, biopsies, ventricular shunting, and radiation therapy, our findings suggest that metabolic reprogramming plays a crucial role in the transition from recurrent to metastatic GB. Targeting these metabolic shifts could provide new avenues for managing and preventing extracranial metastasis in GB, making this an important focus for future research.",Jusheghani F,Department of Biotechnology,Ahmadpourrashidi89@gmail.com.

Compared with controls, two neutrophil populations, immature neutrophils and neutrophils with type II interferon signature genes (Neu_T2ISG), are increased in patients with MPA. Trajectory and cell-cell interaction analyses identify Neu_T2ISG as a subset that differentiates from mature neutrophils upon stimulation with IFN-γ and TNF, which synergize to induce myeloperoxidase and Fcγ receptors expression on the neutrophil cell surface and promote ANCA-induced neutrophil extracellular trap formation. Case-by-case analysis indicates that patients with a high proportion of the Neu_T2ISG subset are associated with persistent vasculitis symptoms.

40274769,SOX5 inhibition overcomes PARP inhibitor resistance in BRCA-mutated breast and ovarian cancer.,2025-04-25,Cell death & disease,10.1038/s41419-025-07660-7,"Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors are effective in cells with homologous recombination (HR) deficiency, including BRCA1/2 mutation. However, PARP inhibitors remain a therapeutic challenge in breast and ovarian cancer due to inevitably acquired resistance in most cases. Therefore, strategies to overcome PARP inhibitor resistance are unmet clinical need. SRY-box transcription factor 5 (SOX5) plays a crucial role in development of various cancers but the role of SOX5 in PARP inhibitor resistance is poorly understood. This study identified SOX5 as a potential biomarker associated with PARP inhibitor resistance and addressed potential treatment strategies to overcome PARP inhibitor resistance using the olaparib-resistant preclinical model. We observed that SOX5 was significantly upregulated in olaparib-resistant cells and contributed to PARP inhibitor resistance by upregulating DNA repair pathway genes. Ectopic SOX5 overexpression contributed to PARP inhibitor resistance by suppressing DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) in BRCA-mutated breast and ovarian cancer. SOX5 small interfering RNA combined with olaparib sensitized olaparib-resistant cells and suppressed the growth of olaparib-resistant xenografts in mice via increased DSBs represented by ɣH2AX formation. Mechanistically, SOX5 directly interacted with yes-associated protein 1 (YAP1) and promoted its nuclear translocation by suppressing the Hippo pathway. YAP1, in association with TEA domain family members (TEAD), upregulated HR-related gene expression and conferred PARP inhibitor resistance. Furthermore, the clinical relevance of SOX5 as a therapeutic target was supported by a significant association between SOX5 overexpression and poor prognosis in ovarian cancer on public mRNA microarray data sets. Therefore, we propose SOX5 as a promising therapeutic target for overcoming PARP inhibitor resistance in BRCA1/2-mutated breast and ovarian cancer.",,,ymoon@cha.ac.kr.

Clinical endocrinology & metabolism,10.1016/j.beem.2025.101999,"After diagnosis of craniopharyngioma, patients frequently develop a rapid weight gain leading to morbid hypothalamic obesity due to disease- and/or treatment-associated hypothalamic lesions. Hypothalamic obesity should be diagnosed and treated in the context of hypothalamic syndrome. Hypothalamic syndrome includes neuroendocrine deficiencies, disruption of circadian rhythm, disturbed hunger-satiety and thirst feelings, temperature dysregulation, and neurocognitive, sleep and psychosocial behavioral problems. Long-term prognosis is frequently impaired by increased risk for metabolic syndrome, cardiovascular problems, severe impairments of health-related quality of life, and premature mortality. Treatment of hypothalamic syndrome is challenging. Recently, an algorithm for personalized, risk-specific treatment of hypothalamic syndrome has been published. Dextro-amphetamines and other central stimulating agents as well as glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R) agonists may cause weight loss. Bariatric surgery is effective. However, non-reversible procedures are controversial due to ethical and legal considerations in minors.

However, obtaining FDM pharma-ink (drug-loaded filaments) of consistent diameter may be challenging and time consuming by hot melt extrusion. Additionally, to implement non-destructive quality control methods for 3DP tablets requires producing tablets containing varying levels of active pharmaceutical ingredient for model calibration. Some of these levels may not be possible to manufacture due to impaired formulation processability. Here, vacuum compression moulding (VCM) melt-processing was deployed for assessing two aims for 3DP of personalised oral tablets. First, as a novel small-scale production method for dimensionally accurate pharma-ink, and second, accomplishing non-destructive dose verification in 3DP tablets with a model derived from VCM object samples acting as 3DP tablet surrogates. Tablets containing 10, 20, and 30 mg tamoxifen, a drug currently being progressed in 3DP clinical trials, were accurately printed with the developed pharma-ink, with mass and drug content variations within European and U.S. pharmacopoeia specifications. Release profiles were equal between tablet sizes. For the first time, the feasibility of cylindrical VCM objects as tablet surrogates was demonstrated for non-destructive near-infrared (NIR) dose determination in 3DP tablets.

These delays are largely attributed to complex health technology assessments, extended price negotiations and protracted provincial listing decisions. To address these challenges, in November 2023, Canada's Drug Agency (CDA) introduced its first early access program - the time-limited reimbursement recommendation (TLR) - aimed at accelerating the reimbursement of promising drugs undergoing Health Canada's Notice of Compliance with Conditions (NOC/c) process. In conjunction, the pan-Canadian Pharmaceutical Alliance developed the Temporary Access Process (pTAP) to support price negotiations for drugs that go through CDA's TLR pathway. AbbVie corporation was the first company to participate in the TLR and pTAP processes with EPKINLY (epcoritamab) - a novel treatment for advanced lymphoma. On 18 June 2024, EPKINLY became the first therapy in Canada to receive a positive CDA TLR recommendation and on 19 July 2024, AbbVie and the pan-Canadian Pharmaceutical Alliance successfully concluded pTAP negotiations. As of 1 November 2024, EPKINLY was listed in nine provinces, achieving a 10.7 month faster time-to-patient than the average time for the standard process, which is significant and meaningful to patients. This achievement demonstrates the potential of the TLR and pTAP processes to improve medicine access timelines for patients. However, an analysis of drugs that received NOC/c status from Health Canada between 2020 and 2024 reveals that very few drugs would have met the current strict eligibility criteria required to benefit from the TLR, limiting the potential benefits of these programs. While TLR and pTAP are promising initiatives, refinements are needed to maximize their impact and ensure faster access to life-saving therapies for Canadian patients.",Balijepalli C; Gullapalli L; Prasad S; Roc NP; Rusu A; Price N; Dempster W; Barakat S,3Sixty Public Affairs; AbbVie Corporation; Pharmalytics Group; AbbVie Pty Ltd,

The present study examined the association between CVD and (i) seasonality of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D) and (ii) individual 25(OH)D concentrations. Harmonized 25(OH)D data were obtained from the Biomarkers for Cardiovascular Risk Assessment in Europe (BiomarCaRE) project, including 79,570 participants examined between 1984 and 2010. One 25(OH)D measurement was available per participant. Primary endpoints were CVD incidence (coronary heart disease or stroke; n = 6006) and CVD mortality (n = 2985). To study (i), Poisson regression-derived rate ratios were compared according to two-month categories, ordered by baseline 25(OH)D concentrations. To study (ii), Cox regression-derived hazard ratios were compared according to quarters of baseline 25(OH)D concentrations. With respect to (i), despite a median 25(OH)D concentration ratio of 1:1.79, the trough months of 25(OH)D in March and April had a similar CVD incidence as the peak months of 25(OH)D in August and September (rate ratio: 1.07, 95% CI: 0.98-1.17). CVD mortality was slightly higher in the trough months compared to the peak months (rate ratio: 1.27, 95% CI: 1.12-1.44) but not compared to the other months (despite median 25[OH]D concentration ratios up to 1:1.62; p ≥ 0.077). The CVD mortality peak in January preceded the 25(OH)D trough, not adhering to the temporality criterion of Bradford Hill. With respect to (ii), compared to the lowest quarter, the highest quarter of 25(OH)D was associated with lower CVD incidence (hazard ratio: 0.82, 95% CI: 0.76-0.89) and CVD mortality (hazard ratio: 0.64, 95% CI: 0.57-0.72). The present study does not support the hypothesis that seasonal increases in CVD are driven by short-term reductions in 25(OH)D.

A cross-sectional study was conducted through a retrospective review of electronic medical records from onsite clinics at a South Korean semiconductor company. The study focused on employees who visited the onsite clinics between 2013 and 2016 due to the risk of chronic diseases including hypertension, diabetes, and dyslipidemia. Descriptive statistics assessed clinic utilization and adherence, while multivariable logistic regression identified influencing factors, adjusted for age, sex, work type, work shift, workplace, specific onsite clinic, diagnosis, and disease duration. Out of the 39,073 employees examined, 8,837 sought care at onsite clinics for managing chronic disease risks. The majority of these participants were male (88.2%) and predominantly aged in their 30s and 40s (84.6%). Among these individuals, 33.0% visited the clinics five or more times, and 28.5% filled prescriptions on two or more occasions. Chronic diseases were the second most common reason for onsite clinic visits. The average adherence to prescription as measured by the Proportion of Days Covered (PDC) was 0.61, with 40% of individuals showing a high adherence. Notably, older age and employment at workplaces located outside metropolitan areas were significant factors positively associated with both the utilization of onsite clinic services and adherence to prescribed treatments. This study found that onsite clinics within a semiconductor company were actively utilized for managing chronic diseases, particularly among older employees and those in workplaces located in areas where medical access is limited compared to metropolitan areas. These findings highlight the potential role of onsite clinics in enhancing chronic disease management. Future research across a broader range of workplaces could further support and expand these insights.",,,

It is crucial for the pharmaceutical industry to be clear of the reporting and case management requirements for such issues. The Health Sciences Authority of Singapore used a mixed-methods evaluation strategy, combining an online questionnaire and face-to-face focus group discussions to identify areas for knowledge enhancement and challenges faced by the industry regarding product defect reporting and recall procedures. These findings were used to plan training workshops. A self-administered online survey was emailed to representatives of all pharmaceutical companies with registered medicines and/or vaccines, or cell, tissue and gene therapy products (CTGTPs) in Singapore. The aim was to find out the challenges faced with product defect reporting and recall procedures. Two face-to-face focus group discussions were conducted with selected companies, specifically those that conducted product recalls between September 2022 and August 2024. A two-day online industry training workshop was held in October 2024. Pre- and post-workshop quizzes, including self-rating questions, were conducted to quantify the participants' baseline knowledge and what they gained from the workshop. In total, 136 out of 463 individuals (29.4%) completed the online survey questionnaire for medicines and vaccines, while 24 out of 42 individuals (57.1%) completed the survey for CTGTPs. Seventeen industry professionals were invited for two focus group discussions. Participants provided feedback on existing processes, and requested clearer guidelines and examples on reportable defects, to aid their internal decision-making. The training workshop saw 318 and 271 industry professionals in attendance over two days, respectively, with 160 participating in both pre- and post-workshop quizzes. There was an improvement in average quiz scores ranging from 4.5% to 25.0% post-workshop. Participants' self-ratings also improved from a median of 3 (out of 5) to median of 4 from pre- to post-workshop. The series of evaluations revealed an enhanced understanding of regulatory requirements in industry professionals through a combination of surveys, focus group discussions and tailored training workshops. These initiatives can equip the industry with knowledge to make informed decisions and enhance overall compliance with product defect reporting and recall procedures.

Ruzasvir, a small-molecule NS5A inhibitor, has demonstrated improved anti-HCV activity compared with first-generation NS5A inhibitors. Clinical studies have demonstrated favorable efficacy and safety of bemnifosbuvir and ruzasvir in combination with other NS5A and NS5B inhibitors, respectively. A Phase 1 study in healthy participants was conducted to assess the drug-drug interaction potential between bemnifosbuvir and ruzasvir, as well as food effects following coadministration of both compounds. Under fasted conditions, the peak, trough, and total exposure to bemnifosbuvir and its metabolites were increased upon coadministration with ruzasvir (by a maximum of 33% vs bemnifosbuvir alone), whereas the corresponding values for ruzasvir were decreased upon coadministration with bemnifosbuvir (by a maximum of 26% vs ruzasvir alone). Food delayed peak exposure to both drugs (by up to 2 hours) while increasing their peak and total exposure by up to 63%. No serious adverse events or premature drug discontinuations were reported.

Patients and clinicians were blinded to the index and alerts. Participants were followed for 12 months for site reporting of events. A total of 2,155 patients were enrolled at 103 sites and were monitored remotely (39% implantable cardioverter-defibrillators and 61% cardiac resynchronization therapy-defibrillators). There were 243 hospitalizations for HF, of which 156 (64%) were index hospitalizations. There were 25 (28%) unplanned all-cause readmissions in the 30 days after discharge and 45 (46%) all-cause readmissions within 90 days. Alert sensitivity for outpatient visits and hospitalizations for HF was 78.3%, and the false-positive rate was 1.18/year. The HeartLogic index was higher before index hospitalizations for HF when followed by HF or readmission for all causes. Index hospitalizations for HF were also more likely to be followed by readmission for HF in 90 days if the patient was in an alert state (vs out-of-alert state) 1 or 2 weeks before or 2 weeks after the index admission. HeartLogic index trends were significantly different for patients who were readmitted for HF. These trends suggest that individuals at risk for readmission have had a more sustained worsening and/or insufficient intervention during the initial hospitalization for HF.

An important supporter of this research has been the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK), most recently through the Accelerating Medicines Partnership Program for Type 2 Diabetes (AMP T2D) and Accelerating Medicines Partnership Program for Common Metabolic Diseases (AMP CMD). These public-private partnerships of the National Institutes of Health, multiple biopharmaceutical and life sciences companies, and nonprofit organizations, facilitated and managed by the Foundation for the National Institutes of Health, were designed to improve understanding of therapeutically relevant biological pathways for type 2 diabetes. On the occasion of NIDDK's 75th anniversary, we review the history of NIDDK support for these partnerships, which saw the convergence of research directions prioritized by academic consortia, the pharmaceutical industry, and government funders. Although the NIDDK was not the sole originator or funder of these efforts, its support and leadership have been pivotal to the partnerships' success and have enabled their research to be broadly accessible through the AMP Common Metabolic Diseases Knowledge Portal (CMDKP) and the AMP Common Metabolic Diseases Genome Atlas (CMDGA). Findings from AMP CMD align with NIDDK's mission to conduct research and share results with the goal of improving health and quality of life.

Once diagnosed, treatment is generally limited to intravenous thrombolysis (IVT), endovascular thrombectomy, or both. Intravenous thrombolysis has theoretical benefits (enhancing reperfusion, dissolving smaller thrombi) and harms (delaying time to endovascular intervention, allergic reaction, increased bleeding risk). To assess the effects of endovascular thrombectomy with IVT versus without IVT on functional independence (defined as a modified Rankin Scale score (mRS) < 3) within 90 days in people with acute ischaemic stroke. We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, Scopus, LILACS, Google Scholar, the International HTA database, and two trial registries to November 2023. We included randomised controlled trials of adults with acute ischaemic stroke who received endovascular therapy and were randomised to either intravenous thrombolysis within 4.5 hours or a control. Outcomes were: functional independence (mRS score < 3), excellent functional outcome (mRS score < 2), mortality, asymptomatic intracranial haemorrhage, symptomatic intracranial haemorrhage, successful revascularisation (thrombolysis in cerebral infarction (TICI) grades 2b to 3), and complete revascularisation (TICI grade 3 only), within 90 days. We used the Cochrane RoB 2 tool to assess the following potential sources of bias for each outcome: bias arising from the randomisation process; bias due to deviations from intended interventions; bias due to missing outcome data; bias in measurement of the outcome; and bias in selection of the reported result. We pooled outcome data using the random-effects model and performed meta-analyses using the Mantel-Haenszel method. We assessed the statistical heterogeneity of pooled data by visually inspecting forest plots to consider the direction and magnitude of effects, and used the Chi We included six studies, with a total of 2336 participants (1166 control and 1170 intervention).

There were no important variations in the outcomes reported across studies. All six studies were at overall low risk of bias for each outcome. There was probably little to no difference in functional independence between the IVT and control groups (risk ratio (RR) 1.03, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.92 to 1.14; P = 0.62; 6 studies, 2336 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). There was no evidence of a difference in excellent functional outcome between the IVT and control groups (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.05; P = 0.67; 6 studies, 2336 participants; high-certainty evidence). There was no evidence of a difference in mortality between the IVT and control groups (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.14; P = 0.54; 6 studies, 2336 participants; high-certainty evidence). There was no evidence of a difference in asymptomatic intracranial haemorrhage between the IVT and control groups (RR 1.13, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.29; P = 0.06; 6 studies, 2334 participants; high-certainty evidence). There was probably little to no difference in symptomatic intracranial haemorrhage between the IVT and control groups (RR 1.20, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.70; P = 0.31; 6 studies, 2336 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). There was a higher rate of successful revascularisation with IVT over control (RR 1.04, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.08; P = 0.008; 6 studies, 2326 participants; high-certainty evidence). There was a higher rate of complete revascularisation with IVT over control (RR 1.14, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.28; P = 0.02; 5 studies, 2037 participants; high-certainty evidence). Limitations included: differences in inclusion and exclusion criteria between studies (e.g. age thresholds, pre-existing comorbidities or baseline functional status, time periods, diagnostic imaging, specific vessels); specific endovascular device used; thrombolysis medication and dose; and potential conflict of interest, as multiple study authors reported receiving funding or fees from pharmaceutical companies. For functional independence, assessed as an mRS score < 3 within 90 days, we downgraded the certainty of evidence by one level due to a high I The evidence does not currently support a clear benefit or harm for routine intravenous thrombolysis amongst people receiving endovascular thrombectomy. Amongst participants receiving endovascular thrombectomy, IVT did not demonstrate evidence of a difference in functional independence, excellent functional outcome, mortality, and asymptomatic intracranial haemorrhage, or symptomatic intracranial haemorrhage, when compared with no IVT. However, IVT did result in a higher rate of successful and complete revascularisation when compared with no IVT. Future research should include more high-quality trials to further evaluate the role of intravenous thrombolysis in people receiving endovascular thrombectomy to provide more robust data and further narrow the confidence intervals. Future research should also identify whether time- and person-specific factors influence the effect of IVT amongst those receiving endovascular thrombectomy.

40271450,Efficacy of palliative stenting in patients with esophageal obstruction attributable to malignancy.,,DEN open,10.1002/deo2.70120,"Self-expandable metallic stent (SEMS) placement is useful for patients with poor oral intake caused by esophageal stricture attributable to malignancy. In this study, we examined the usefulness of esophageal SEMS placement as a palliative treatment and evaluated the prognostic factors. Patients who underwent esophageal SEMS placement at three regional base hospitals from December 2007 to June 2023 were included in the study. Of 73 patients, 57 patients who underwent palliative SEMS placement were evaluated after excluding 16 patients in whom postoperative treatment was possible after SEMS placement. Median survival after SEMS placement was 67 days (mean, 96 ± 16 days). Univariate analysis identified age (≤78 years vs. >78 years), performance status (3 or 4 vs. 1 or 2), the cancer location (other sites vs. gastrointestinal cancer), the resumption of oral intake (failure vs. success), and clinical stage (IVA/IVB vs. III) as prognostic factors after SEMS placement. On multivariate analysis, performance status 3 or 4 (odds ratio [OR] = 2.87, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.28-6.45), cancers other than gastrointestinal cancer (OR = 3.75, 95% CI = 1.14-12.3), and failure to resume oral intake (OR = 21.3, 95% CI = 3.40-133.0) were significantly associated with poor prognosis. Palliative treatment with SEMS placement was safe, and a high percentage of patients resumed food intake. An inability to resume food intake, poor performance status, and cancer outside the gastrointestinal tract were poor prognostic factors.",,,

It is a neurodegenerative illness-and the second most common type of dementia after Alzheimer's disease-that causes memory loss and severe problems in carrying out daily activities. In this report, we describe a case of Lewy body dementia that began with early psychotic symptoms with atypical features (transition from hallucinosis (hallucinatory insight) to true visual hallucinations) -without Parkinsonism. The patient exhibited sensitivity to first generation antipsychotic medication, which led to a worsening of her symptoms. Physicians should consider all possible diagnoses when confronted with atypical, early symptoms of visual hallucinosis or true hallucinations and dementia without Parkinsonism. Choosing antipsychotic medicines should be made with care given these patients' possible sensitivity to antipsychotics. The selection of antipsychotics should be consider among first, second and third generation options.",,,

40270036,Health-related quality of life correlates with patient-reported and proxy-reported disability in critical illness survivors: a secondary analysis of the ERIC trial.,2025-04-24,"Critical care (London, England)",10.1186/s13054-025-05399-3,"Expanding follow-up services for survivors of critical illness requires short and reliable instrument sets. The WHO Disability Assessment Schedule (WHODAS) 2.0 and the EuroQol 5-Dimensions 5-Level (EQ-5D-5L) are recommended to assess disability and health-related quality of life (HrQoL), respectively. As they may measure partially overlapping constructs, we assessed their relationship. We conducted a secondary analysis of the multicenter cluster-randomized controlled Enhanced Recovery after Intensive Care (ERIC) trial (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT03671447). At follow-ups scheduled 6 months after ICU discharge, critical illness survivors and caregivers completed the EQ-5D-5L, the patient-reported and the proxy-reported 12-item WHODAS 2.0. We employed local polynomial regressions, correlation coefficients, and linear regressions to analyze the global and domain-specific relationships between the EQ-5D-5L and the WHODAS 2.0. We analyzed 700 patients with a median EQ-5D-5L index value of 0.81 [IQR 0.52 to 0.94], a median patient-reported WHODAS 2.0 sum score of 11 [IQR 3 to 23], and a median proxy-reported WHODAS 2.0 sum score of 16 [IQR 6 to 28]. The EQ-5D-5L index value highly correlated with patient-reported (Spearman: - 0.84 [95% CI - 0.86 to - 0.82]) and proxy-reported (Spearman: - 0.70 [- 0.76 to - 0.64]) WHODAS 2.0 sum scores. Corresponding domains were also highly correlated, with the patient-reported WHODAS 2.0 aligning more closely with the EQ-5D-5L than the proxy-reported WHODAS 2.0. We found ceiling and floor effects for both instruments, indicating limitations for detecting mild disabilities and high HrQoL. In multivariable linear regressions, the patient-reported and proxy-reported WHODAS 2.0 sum scores (both - 0.02 [95% CI - 0.02 to - 0.02], p < 0.01) and WHODAS 2.0 domain scores for mobility, self-care, and life activities were predictors of the EQ-5D-5L index value and respective EQ-5D-5L domain scores. Our results suggest a high correlation between the patient-reported and proxy-reported WHODAS 2.0 and the EQ-5D-5L, particularly in their corresponding domains. To economize post-ICU assessments, there may be no need to use both instruments simultaneously.",Ribet Buse E; Grunow JJ; Spies CD; Weiss B; Paul N,Department of Anesthesiology and Intensive Care Medicine (CCM/CVK),nicolas.paul@charite.de.
40270013,Qualitative changes in clinical records after implementation of pharmacist-led antimicrobial stewardship program: a text mining analysis.,,Journal of pharmaceutical health care and sciences,10.1186/s40780-025-00439-0,"Antimicrobial stewardship programs (ASPs) are essential for optimizing antimicrobial use, but many medium-sized hospitals lack infectious disease (ID) specialists. Ward pharmacists can contribute to ASPs, but the qualitative changes in their practice patterns after ASP implementation remains unclear. We aimed to explore the potential of text mining as a novel methodology to evaluate changes in ward pharmacist antimicrobial management practices after ASP implementation in a medium-sized hospital without ID physicians. We conducted a retrospective observational analysis of data documented in clinical records by ward pharmacists in a 313-bed community hospital from April 2014 to March 2022. The ASP team conducted weekly reviews of targeted patients, provided feedback to physicians, and shared recommendations with ward pharmacists who then collaborated to optimize antimicrobial therapy. Using Python-based text mining with standardized technical terms and compound word extraction, we performed morphological analysis, co-occurrence network analysis, and hierarchical clustering to evaluate documentation patterns before and after ASP implementation in April 2018. Co-occurrence relationships were assessed using Dice coefficients (threshold, ≥ 0.3), and communities were detected using the Louvain algorithm. Changes in documentation patterns were compared using Fisher's exact test. The analysis included 1,353 pre-ASP and 5,155 post-ASP clinical records containing antimicrobial-related terms, which increased from 3.12 to 7.81% of the total pharmacy records. New strong co-occurrence relationships emerged in the post-ASP period for several laboratory parameters (c-reactive protein, 0.646; estimated glomerular filtration rate, 0.594; and white blood cell count, 0.582). Network analysis revealed a shift from medication-focused communities (Medication Review, Prescription Verification, and Patient Education) to infection-focused communities (Infection Assessment, Microbiological Review, and Severe Infection Management). Although Antimicrobial Management was consistently used in both periods (odds ratio [OR]: 0.70, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.38-1.20), cross-tabulation analysis increased significantly in Laboratory Monitoring (OR: 1.58, 95% CI: 1.39-1.78) and Infection Assessment (OR: 2.09, 95% CI: 1.85-2.36). This pilot application of text mining demonstrated potential as a novel methodology for objectively evaluating qualitative changes in clinical practice patterns following ASP implementation, successfully identifying shifts in pharmacists' documentation focus and providing a foundation for future multi-center validation studies across diverse healthcare settings.",,,y-muraki@mb.kyoto-phu.ac.jp.
40269747,Mapping of rehabilitation interventions and assessment methods for patients with liver cirrhosis: a scoping review.,2025-04-24,BMC gastroenterology,10.1186/s12876-025-03881-4,"This scoping review aimed to delineate the detailed components of exercise therapy and the evaluation methods used for patients with liver cirrhosis. The methodology involved searching the original PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus for studies published between January 1975 and March 2025. The search was completed on 13 March 2025. Studies describing exercise therapy for liver cirrhosis patients were selected. Relevant information matching the study objectives, such as intervention duration, content, intensity setting, evaluation criteria, and outcomes, was extracted and documented. Of the 2314 articles identified, 18 fit the inclusion and exclusion criteria, with a total of 950 participants. The most prevalent form of exercise therapy was a combined aerobic exercise and strength training program (55.6%). Commonly used assessment criteria included the 6-minute walking distance for endurance evaluation (44.4%) and the Chronic Liver Disease Questionnaire for quality of life assessment (33.3%). Intervention durations ranged from 30 to 60 min per day, 2 to 7 days per week, and 8 to 12 weeks. Concerning intensity setting, subjective fatigue levels and heart rate were frequently used (38.9%), though detailed descriptions were limited. For the establishment of effective exercise therapy for patients with liver cirrhosis, future research should concentrate on tailoring intensity settings according to individual patient needs. Additionally, standardized reporting of intervention details and assessment methods is crucial for improving the quality and comparability of studies in this field.",,,michiyukikawakami@hotmail.com.
40269321,Treatment of acute myeloid leukemia models by targeting a cell surface RNA-binding protein.,,Nature biotechnology,10.1038/s41587-025-02648-2,"Immunotherapies for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and other cancers are limited by a lack of tumor-specific targets. Here we discover that RNA-binding proteins and glycosylated RNAs (glycoRNAs) form precisely organized nanodomains on cancer cell surfaces. We characterize nucleophosmin (NPM1) as an abundant cell surface protein (csNPM1) on a variety of tumor types. With a focus on AML, we observe csNPM1 on blasts and leukemic stem cells but not on normal hematopoietic stem cells. We develop a monoclonal antibody to target csNPM1, which exhibits robust anti-tumor activity in multiple syngeneic and xenograft models of AML, including patient-derived xenografts, without observable toxicity. We find that csNPM1 is expressed in a mutation-agnostic manner on primary AML cells and may therefore offer a general strategy for detecting and treating AML. Surface profiling and in vivo work also demonstrate csNPM1 as a target on solid tumors. Our data suggest that csNPM1 and its neighboring glycoRNA-cell surface RNA-binding protein (csRBP) clusters may serve as an alternative antigen class for therapeutic targeting or cell identification.",,,ryan.flynn@childrens.harvard.edu.
