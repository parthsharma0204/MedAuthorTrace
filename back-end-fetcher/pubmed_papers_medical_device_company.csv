A total of 47 adult Korean patients with one or more kidney stones, ranging in maximal size from 5 to 30 mm, were recruited, and 46 patients were included in the analysis. The median age of patients was 57.50 [IQR 48.25-63.00] years, with a median of 1.00 [IQR 1.00-2.00] stones per patient and a median maximal size of 13.70 [IQR, 10.00-16.00] mm and a volume of 349.65 [IQR 201.60-704.10] mm³. The stone-free rates were 93.48% (< 4 mm), 71.74% (< 2 mm), and 56.52% (zero stone), based on each respective stone-free definition, with no conversions to conventional surgery. The median operative time was 91.50 [IQR 64.25-113.75] minutes, with a median console time of 71.00 [IQR 39.25-92.75] minutes. Ureteral injuries occurred in 17.39% of cases, including 6.52% Grade I and 10.87% Grade II injuries, all related to manual insertion of a ureteral access sheath. The postoperative complication rate was 6.52%, with all cases being Grade II urinary tract infections. Laser ablation speed was higher for larger stones. The operators reported low levels of musculoskeletal fatigue and numbness. The results demonstrated the efficacy and safety of the robot-assisted flexible ureteroscopic surgery using Zamenix R. Further investigation is required, including a comparison with the standard of care and a larger sample size.",Kim J; Kwon DS,ROEN Surgical,moretry@snu.ac.kr.
40389561,PRESERFLO™ MicroShunt as a treatment option for highly increased intraocular pressure in primary open angle glaucoma and pseudoexfoliation glaucoma.,,"Eye (London, England)",10.1038/s41433-025-03843-w,"The Preserflo-MicroShunt (PF) is an established device for treating glaucoma, effectively reducing intraocular pressure (IOP) with a good safety record. However, its efficacy in eyes with significantly elevated preoperative IOP levels is not well-documented due to exclusion from many clinical studies. This study aims to evaluate PF outcomes in eyes with highly increased IOP and compare them with those having moderately increased levels. Retrospectively, eyes diagnosed with primary open angle glaucoma (POAG) or pseudoexfoliation glaucoma (PXG) undergoing PF were analysed. They were categorized into two groups: highly increased IOP (HI-IOP, ≥30 mmHg) and moderately increased IOP (MI-IOP, ≤25 mmHg). IOP, number of IOP lowering medications (NoM), success rates (SR), and postoperative complications were compared at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months. One year postoperatively, IOP was reduced from 39.0 ± 7.4 mmHg to 14.4 ± 4.4 mmHg in the HI-IOP and from 19.5 ± 3.6 mmHg to 14.0 ± 4.5 mmHg in the MI-IOP group. NoM decreased significantly in both groups (p < 0.001 for all). Success rates did not differ between groups during the first year (p > 0.05 in all subgroups). However, the HI- IOP group had higher rates of persistent hypotony (7% vs. 0%, p = 0.02) and tendentially higher rates of choroidal detachment (23% vs. 11%, p = 0.08). Other adverse events were rare and comparable. Further glaucoma surgery was required in 26% and 19% of cases, respectively (p = 0.41). PF appears to be a suitable option for managing both highly and moderately increased IOP levels in POAG and PXG eyes, with comparable outcomes up to 12 months following surgery.",,,theresa.theilig@med.uni-jena.de.
40388358,Implantation of Tissue-Engineered Vascular Graft in Mouse Carotid Artery via Cuff Technique.,2025-05-19,Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE,10.3791/68022,"The development of small-diameter vascular grafts has been a global endeavor, with numerous research groups contributing to this field. Animal experimentation plays a pivotal role in assessing the efficacy and safety of vascular grafts, particularly in the absence of clinical applications. Compared to alternative animal models, the mouse implantation model offers several advantages, including a well-defined genetic background, a mature method for disease model construction, and a straightforward surgical procedure. Based on these advantages, the present study devised a simple cuff technique for the implantation of tissue-engineered vascular grafts in the mouse carotid artery. This technique began with the fabrication of polycaprolactone (PCL) small-diameter vascular grafts via electrostatic spinning, followed by the seeding of macrophages onto the grafts through perfusion adsorption. Subsequently, the cellularized tissue-engineered vascular grafts were transplanted into the mouse carotid artery using the cuff technique to evaluate patency and regenerative capability. After 30 days of in vivo implantation, vascular patency was found to be satisfactory, with evidence of neo-tissue regeneration and the formation of an endothelial layer within the lumen of the grafts. All data were analyzed using statistical and graphing software. This study successfully established a mouse carotid artery implantation model that can be used to explore the cellular sources of vascular regeneration and the mechanisms of action of active substances. Furthermore, it provides theoretical support for the development of novel small-diameter vascular grafts.",,,nkwangzhihong@163.com.

40376517,Magnetic resonance imaging for computer-assisted device guidance in transperineal prostate biopsy and cryoablation.,,Translational andrology and urology,10.21037/tau-2024-635,"Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) guided, minimally invasive transperineal interventions have been shown to produce positive clinical outcomes, specifically regarding prostate biopsy and cryoablation of prostate cancer. Many vendors, however, do not provide guidance to clinicians as to how their devices, biopsy needles and cryoprobes should be inserted during procedures. As a result, many leading research institutions have developed in-house solutions for needle insertion guidance. Institutions with less research and engineering support may find the development of their own in-house solutions infeasible, leading to a gap in clinical practice. Our purpose was to develop a replicable toolset using minimal hardware and software to facilitate MRI-guided prostate biopsy and cryoablation. The toolset was validated first in a series of phantom trials, then in a clinical cohort of 24 patients from a single institution. This study utilized a grid-like rigid trajectory guide coupled with custom software to simulate in phantoms, and then perform on patients, prostate-focused interventional procedures using a closed bore General Electric 450W scanner. Only standard imaging sequences were employed, allowing this work to be generalizable between different scanners with no additional setup. Interventionalists imported the coordinates of the targets in the prostate and the 3 saline-filled fiducial markers on the grid into custom software, which then identified the grid hole and depth of insertion necessary to drive needles to the targeted points. In phantom trials, the targeting error of each insertion was logged. All patients enrolled in the study were men over the age of 50 years with either biopsy-confirmed prostate cancer with magnetic resonance (MR)-visible lesions or prostatic fluid collection. Each patient was reviewed by a multidisciplinary focal prostate therapy team consisting of one interventional radiologist and two urologists. Patients were seen in interventional radiology and urology clinics. During each procedure the number of needle insertions and adjustments was tracked to better evaluate accuracy in clinical practice. The targeting grid and software allowed rapid, repeatable needle insertions with a mean error of 1.05 mm and a standard deviation 0.38 mm. Across 24 prostate-focused procedures (9 biopsies, 14 cryoablations, 1 fluid aspiration), the tools guided interventionalists on their initial insertion of biopsy needles or cryoprobes. In an average procedure, 81.8% of the inserted needles required no adjustment from their first insertion. All procedures achieved technical success during the intervention, satisfying the leading clinician's standards for biopsy sample collection and/or ablation coverage. Phantom and patient trials found that the proposed tools and techniques enabled clinicians to quickly and accurately place their needles in simulated tissue and clinical procedures. This minimal-investment adaptation of a diagnostic scanner for interventional purposes lowers barriers to entry for image-guided prostate interventions, while the trajectory guide's simplicity requires no specialized on-site engineering support and can be readily fabricated, promoting greater ease-of-use.",,,

However, a limitation of these studies is that questions posed to LLMs are generated by experts. This study aimed to investigate ChatGPT-4o effectiveness in answering CRC screening queries directly generated by patients. Ten consecutive subjects aged 50 to 69 years who were eligible for the Italian national CRC screening program but not actively involved were enrolled. Four possible scenarios for CRC screening were presented to each participant and they were asked to formulate one question per scenario to gather additional information. These questions were then posed to ChatGPT in two separate sessions. The responses were evaluated by five senior experts, who rated each answer based on three criteria: accuracy, completeness, and comprehensibility, using a 5-point Likert scale. In addition, the same 10 patients who created the questions assessed the answers, rating each response as complete, understandable, and trustworthy on a dichotomous scale (yes/no). Experts rated the responses with mean scores of 4.1 ± 1.0 for accuracy, 4.2 ± 1.0 for completeness, and 4.3 ± 1.0 for comprehensibility. Patients rated responses as complete in 97.5%, understandable in 95%, and trustworthy in 100% of cases. Consistency over time was confirmed by an 86.8% similarity between session responses.

This study analyzes the performance of monocular markerless pose estimation systems on human skeletal joint estimation while wearing exoskeletons. Two pose estimation systems producing RGB and depth images from ten viewpoints are evaluated for one subject in 14 industrial poses. The experiment was repeated for three different types of exoskeletons on the same subject. An optical tracking system (OTS) was used as a reference system. The image acceptance rate was 56% for the RGB, 22% for the depth, and 78% for the OTS pose estimation system. The key sources of pose estimation error were the occlusions from the exoskeletons, industrial poses, and viewpoints. The reference system showed decreased performance when the optical markers were occluded by the exoskeleton or when the markers' position shifted with the exoskeleton. This study performs a systematic comparison of two types of monocular markerless pose estimation systems and an optical tracking system, as well as a proposed metric, based on a tracking quality ratio, to assess whether a skeletal joint estimation would be acceptable for human kinematics analysis in exoskeleton studies.",,,

This study aims to clarify their comparability in a large population sample. CMR and two- (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) TTE were used to quantify left and right heart dimensions in participants of the Hamburg City Health Study. Intertechnique agreement was evaluated using Bland-Altman analyses, Pearson correlation coefficients, and Cohen's Kappa. Data from 2126 participants (median age 67 [IQR: 59-72] years, 897 (42.2%) female) were analyzed. Left ventricular (LV) diastolic volumes were similar (CMR: 117.0 [96.2, 138.0] ml, 2D-TTE: 111.8 [93.6, 134.3] ml, r = 0.7, p < 0.001), while systolic volumes were lower with CMR (CMR: 36.0 [26.9, 46.0] ml, 2D-TTE: 46.7 [37.9, 57.5] ml, r = 0.67, p < 0.001). CMR LV ejection fraction (LVEF) was 10% higher than 2D-TTE (CMR = 69.0 [64.0, 74.0]%, 2D-TTE = 58.3 [55.5, 61.7]%, p < 0.001; r = 0.40, p < 0.001). Left atrial volumes correlated moderately with low bias (CMR: 53.0 [40.0, 68.0] ml, 2D-TTE: 51.6 [41.5, 64.0] ml, r = 0.63, p < 0.001). LV mass showed good correlation but was higher using 2D-TTE (r = 0.74, p < 0.001). Right ventricular (RV) volumes showed the largest differences, with CMR demonstrating lower interobserver variability (ICC = 0.97 vs. 0.61 for 2D-TTE) and markedly larger volumes (RVEDV mean bias = 74.8 ml, r = 0.50, p < 0.001). In a large general population, CMR quantifies cardiac function and dimensions more reliably than TTE.

The MANAGE-PD tool ( www.managepd.eu ) was developed to help identify patients with advanced PD and to facilitate treatment decision making and appropriate allocation of patients to device-aided therapies (DAT). This prospective, non-interventional study aimed to investigate the real-world disease burden of PD and treatment optimization after MANAGE-PD implementation. Adult PD patients (N = 278) visited specialist clinics and neurologist's practices in Germany in 2022. Disease burden was assessed using the Unified PD rating scale (UPDRS parts II-IV), the non-motor symptoms scale (NMSS) and the 8-item Parkinson's disease Questionnaire (PDQ-8). Data on planned treatment changes were collected. Data were analyzed by disease control categories according to the MANAGE-PD tool. Mean scores for motor and non-motor symptoms, quality of life, and comorbidity burden were worse in patients with lower disease control measured by MANAGE-PD. For 52.8% of patients in Category 2 (inadequately controlled-might benefit from oral optimization), no change in oral treatment was planned. No change in oral treatment and no DAT initiation was planned for 37.9% and 65.0% of patients in Category 3 (inadequately controlled-might benefit from DAT). Patient refusal and needing more time to decide were the most common reasons for not making treatment changes. This study supports the validity of MANAGE-PD by showing its high association with disease burden and emphasizes the importance of timely provision of necessary information to enable informed decisions about treatment optimization.",Südmeyer M; Siebecker F; Arlt C; Kopra J; Jost WH,Parkinson-Klinik Ortenau; AbbVie Deutschland GmbH & Co.

Due to their lipophilicity, OP easily cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and affect the central nervous system (CNS), resulting in epileptic seizures and long-term cognitive impairment. The antidote includes oximes which reactivate inhibited AChE. Unfortunately, oximes have limited BBB penetration and therefore fail to prevent neurological damage. Improving the penetration of oximes through the CNS and their therapeutic effect on the brain, is a major challenge. Recent studies have demonstrated the efficacy of transcranial focused ultrasound (FUS), in combination to intravenously injected microbubbles, to transiently disrupt the BBB for drug delivery. We assessed the efficacy of FUS to deliver two known oximes (2-PAM, HI-6) into the brain and reactivate AChE following an exposure to VX in a mouse model. After both sub-lethal and supra-lethal exposure, HI-6 + FUS treatment reactivated nearly 30 % more AChE in the hippocampus than HI-6 alone. In contrast, 2-PAM+FUS was not effective. Furthermore, animals treated with HI-6 + FUS following an exposure to a supra-lethal dose of VX exhibited enhanced short-term recovery and an increased 24 hours survival rate. Finally, up to 7 days after exposure to a supra-lethal dose of VX, HI-6 + FUS showed a significant reduction of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and MIP-1α expression levels in the hippocampus. Thus, the use of FUS is very promising for improving the medical care of OP exposure because it enables antidotes to treat central symptoms and it may reduce brain damage.",Lucie L; Sarah L; Laurène J; Louise T; Assia B; Julie K; Alexandre C; Rosalie B; Erwan S; Sébastien M; Benoit L; Nicolas T; Grégory DB; Karine T; Anthony N,Université Paris-Saclay; IRBA,anthony.novell@universite-paris-saclay.fr.

While the feasibility of drone-assisted medical logistics has been explored, its practical application in battlefield transfusion remains unreported. This case report describes the first documented massive transfusion in a combat environment using an autonomous unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). A 27-year-old soldier sustained severe lower limb injuries from an improvised explosive device explosion and developed hemorrhagic shock in a remote battlefield location where adverse weather conditions prevented immediate evacuation. In response, 6 units of whole blood and 2 units of fresh frozen plasma were transported via UAV, enabling prehospital transfusion under telemedicine supervision. The UAV successfully delivered blood products on two consecutive flights, ensuring early resuscitation and stabilization despite delayed evacuation. The casualty's vital signs improved post-transfusion, and surgical interventions were successfully performed following hospital admission. This case demonstrates the feasibility of drone-assisted blood product transport in prolonged field care scenarios. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of a combat casualty receiving a UAV-facilitated massive transfusion in an operational setting. While UAV-based medical logistics offers a rapid and reliable alternative for remote trauma care, challenges remain in regulatory implementation, blood product stability, and integration into standardized protocols. Further controlled studies are needed to optimize UAV-assisted transfusion strategies and their potential expansion into civilian and disaster response settings.",Çamur M,TTGO Medical Technologies Development Office,

Many radiomic features derived from computed tomography (CT) are sensitive to variations across scanners, reconstruction settings, and acquisition protocols. In this phantom study, eight different CT reconstruction parameters were varied to explore image- and feature-level harmonization approaches to improve tissue classification. Varying reconstructions of an anthropomorphic radiopaque phantom containing three lesion categories (metastasis, hemangioma, and benign cyst) and normal liver tissue were used for evaluating two harmonization methods and their combination: (i) generative adversarial networks (GANs) at the image level; (ii) ComBat at the feature level, and (iii) a combination of (i) and (ii). A total of 93 texture and intensity features were extracted from each tissue class before and after image-level harmonization and were also harmonized at the feature level. Reproducibility and stability were assessed via the Concordance Correlation Coefficient (CCC) and pairwise comparisons using paired stability tests. The ability of features to discriminate between tissue classes was assessed by measuring the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. The global reproducibility and discriminative power were assessed by averaging over the entire dataset and across all tissue types. ComBat improved reproducibility by 31.58% and stability by 5.24%, while GAN increased reproducibility by 8% it reduced stability by 4.33%. Classification analysis revealed that ComBat increased average AUC by 15.19%, whereas GAN decreased AUC by 2.56%.

Material properties can be manipulated to direct cell responses, benefiting applications from regenerative medicine to implantable devices such as silicone breast implants. Knowledge about the interaction differences between healthy and cancer cells with implants may guide implant design to more precisely influence cell adhesion and proliferation of healthy cells while inhibiting cancer cells, tailoring outcomes to specific cellular responses. To show-case this potential, breast epithelial cells and breast cancer cells were investigated regarding their interaction with a broad range of combined physicochemical properties. This study employed a silicone-based high-throughput screening method utilizing Double Orthogonal Gradients (DOGs) to investigate the influence of topography, stiffness, and wettability on breast epithelial cells (MCF10a) and breast cancer cells (MCF7). Results show distinct cellular responses, including decreased proliferation rates in both MCF10a and MCF7 cells with the introduction of surface topography and the dominant influence of wettability on cell adhesion, proliferation, and cluster formation. The screening identified specific regions of interest (ROIs) where MCF10a cell proliferation outperformed MCF7 cells and that topography inhibits cluster formation (tumorigenesis), offering potential prospects for the creation of novel implant surfaces.",,,

Therefore we investigated patent infringement claims in the United States within the field of spine surgery. We also provide neurosurgeons with a basic knowledge of patent law. A retrospective review of legal cases published on the legal databases Westlaw and LexisNexis was conducted without time constraints. Patent infringement cases in spine surgery involving medical device companies were included. Criminal cases, other intellectual property cases (eg, copyrights, trademarks), and patent-related litigation not explicitly involving infringement claims (eg, royalties disputes) were excluded. Case characteristics included verdict outcomes, party demographics, case location, case year, type of spinal device involved (eg, surgical implant), type of patent infringement, and legal outcome. Comparisons between plaintiff and defendant verdicts were performed using independent samples t -test or χ 2 test. Of the initial 468 screened cases, 35 met the final inclusion criteria. Cases ranged from 1996 to 2021. Verdict outcomes were split evenly between plaintiffs (49%) and defendants (51%), with most cases involving disputes about surgical implants (n = 25, 71%) between medical device companies (n=29, 83%).

40336121,Integrating local malaria molecular monitoring into regular malaria indicator surveys on Bioko Island: high association between urban communities and low-density infections.,2025-05-08,Malaria journal,10.1186/s12936-025-05374-x,"Effective malaria control requires accurate identification of Plasmodium infections to tailor interventions appropriately. Rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) are crucial tools for this purpose due to their small size and ease-of-use functionality. These tests typically target the Plasmodium falciparum histidine-rich protein 2 (HRP2) antigen. However, some strains of P. falciparum have deletions in the hrp2 and hrp3 genes, which may result in a false negative diagnosis using HRP2-based RDTs. Additionally, RDTs have a detection limit of 100 parasites per microlitre, insufficient for identifying low-density infections that sustain malaria transmission. This study explores integrating molecular monitoring using a novel cartridge-based PCR test, PlasmoPod, using samples from a malaria indicator survey (MIS) on Bioko Island, Equatorial Guinea to enhance detection of low-density infections and inform targeted malaria control strategies. The study utilized a combination of RDTs and the DiaxxoPCR device for molecular monitoring. The device DiaxxoPCR uses a prefilled cartridge system, termed PlasmoPod for a malaria-based assay that employs a qPCR assay targeting 18S rDNA/rRNA. Samples from the 2023 MIS were extracted from dried blood spots (DBS), qPCR run in duplicate on the PlasmoPod. Epidemiological data from the MIS were merged with molecular data and the association between MIS variables to malaria infection by qPCR, and low-density infections were measured. The integration of molecular monitoring revealed a proportion of low-density infections that circumvented RDTs diagnosis. Notably, individuals in urban communities and those reporting recent fever were more likely to harbour low-density, asymptomatic malaria infections. Findings suggest that urban residents, although less associated to malaria infection than rural residents by both RDT and qPCR, may be serving as a transmission reservoir. The relationship between low-density infections and individuals who recently reported fever may reflect recent anti-malarial treatment or natural clearance, and thus have lingering parasites in their blood. The study highlights the limitations of HRP2-based RDTs in detecting low density infections and underscores the potential of molecular tools like PlasmoPod in malaria surveillance. By identifying elusive transmission reservoirs and tracking parasite importation, molecular monitoring can play a crucial role in achieving malaria elimination. The findings advocate for the broader implementation of molecular diagnostics in malaria programs, especially in areas with low transmission, to enhance the detection and targeting of hidden reservoirs of infection.",Nyakarungu E; Rivas MR; Galick DS; Phiri WP; Guerra CA; García GA; Montemartini L; Schindler T,Equatorial Guinea Ministry of Health and Social Welfare; MCD Global Health; Diaxxo AG,thomas.stabler@swisstph.ch.

40327852,Wearable Artificial Intelligence for Sleep Disorders: Scoping Review.,2025-05-07,Journal of medical Internet research,10.2196/65272,"Worldwide, 30%-45% of adults have sleep disorders, which are linked to major health issues such as diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Long-term monitoring with traditional in-lab testing is impractical due to high costs. Wearable artificial intelligence (AI)-powered solutions offer accessible, scalable, and continuous monitoring, improving the identification and treatment of sleep problems. This scoping review aims to provide an overview of AI-powered wearable devices used for sleep disorders, focusing on study characteristics, wearable technology features, and AI methodologies for detection and analysis. Seven electronic databases (MEDLINE, PsycINFO, Embase, IEEE Xplore, ACM Digital Library, Google Scholar, and Scopus) were searched for peer-reviewed literature published before March 2024. Keywords were selected based on 3 domains: sleep disorders, AI, and wearable devices. The primary selection criterion was the inclusion of studies that utilized AI algorithms to detect or predict various sleep disorders using data from wearable devices. Study selection was conducted in 2 steps: first, by reviewing titles and abstracts, followed by full-text screening. Two reviewers independently conducted study selection and data extraction, resolving discrepancies by consensus. The extracted data were synthesized using a narrative approach. The initial search yielded 615 articles, of which 46 met the eligibility criteria and were included in the final analysis. The majority of studies focused on sleep apnea. Wearable AI was widely deployed for diagnosing and screening disorders; however, none of the studies used it for treatment. Commercial devices were the most commonly used type of wearable technology, appearing in 30 out of 46 (65%) studies. Among these, various brands were utilized rather than a single large, well-known brand; 19 (41%) studies used wrist-worn devices. Respiratory data were used by 25 of 46 (54%) studies as the primary data for model development, followed by heart rate (22/46, 48%) and body movement (17/46, 37%). The most popular algorithm was the convolutional neural network, adopted by 17 of 46 (37%) studies, followed by random forest (14/46, 30%) and support vector machines (12/46, 26%). Wearable AI technology offers promising solutions for sleep disorders. These devices can be used for screening and diagnosis; however, research on wearable technology for sleep disorders other than sleep apnea remains limited. To statistically synthesize performance and efficacy results, more reviews are needed. Technology companies should prioritize advancements such as deep learning algorithms and invest in wearable AI for treating sleep disorders, given its potential. Further research is necessary to validate machine learning techniques using clinical data from wearable devices and to develop useful analytics for data collection, monitoring, prediction, classification, and recommendation in the context of sleep disorders.",Khalil L,Weill Cornell Medicine-Qatar,

Global research & reviews,10.5435/JAAOSGlobal-D-24-00282,"Tourniquets are frequently used to minimize blood loss. Standard pressures (STPs) are typically higher than minimum limb occlusion pressure (LOP), which can contribute to postoperative pain among other complications. We sought to investigate the effect of STP versus LOP on postoperative pain and opioid medication use after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR). Sixty patients (age = 37 ± 15 years) undergoing ACLR were recruited and randomized into STP (275 mm Hg; M = 15/F = 15) or LOP (180 ± 29 mm Hg; M = 15/F = 15) group. A photoplethysmography probe was used to determine appropriate tourniquet pressures for the LOP group. Tourniquet and surgical site pain (Visual Analog Scale scores 0 to 10), as well as opioid medication usage, was recorded for 14 days after surgery. A generalized linear mixed model was used to detect differences in pain and medication use over the 14 days. The type-I error was defined as = 0.05. Tourniquet site pain was less in the LOP group during postoperative days (PODs) 1 to 5 (P < 0.05) and averaged across the two-week postoperative period (P = 0.015). Surgery site pain was less in the LOP group at PODs 9 and 14 (P < 0.05). Reduced opioid medication use was observed in the LOP group at PODs 3, 4, and 7 and averaged across the postoperative window (P < 0.05). Individualized LOPs yield decreased postoperative pain and narcotic use compared with STP during ACLR.",Goble H; Lambert B; Liberman S; McCulloch PC,,
40326433,Recommendations on the Collection of Comparator Measurement Data in the Performance Evaluation of Continuous Glucose Monitoring Systems.,,Journal of diabetes science and technology,10.1177/19322968251336221,"While current systems for continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) are safe and effective, there is a high degree of variability between readings within and across CGM systems. In current CGM performance studies, device readings are compared with glucose concentrations obtained with a comparator (""reference"") measurement procedure (usually capillary or venous glucose). However, glucose concentrations from capillary and venous samples can systematically differ, often by as much as 5 to 10%. Different comparator methods have shown biases of up to 8%, and comparator devices of the same brand can systematically differ by more than 5%. To address these issues, the Working Group on CGM of the International Federation of Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Medicine (IFCC WG-CGM) recommends standardizing study procedures and the comparator measurement process in CGM performance studies. The majority of IFCC WG-CGM members recommend the use of capillary samples as reference, mainly because CGM readings will then be aligned better with results from self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG). Even with factory-calibrated CGM systems, manufacturers require CGM users to perform SMBG in some situations, eg, manual calibration, confirmation of extreme readings, discordance between CGM readings and symptoms of hyper- or hypoglycemia, or intermittent signal loss. Comparator devices should meet defined analytical performance specifications for bias and imprecision. Comparator bias can be reduced by retrospective correction of comparator values based on measurements with a method or materials of higher metrological order. Once manufacturers align CGM readings of their systems with comparator results using standardized procedures, variability across CGM systems will be reduced.",Freckmann G; Pleus S; Eichenlaub M; Eriksson Boija E; Fokkert M; Hinzmann R; Jendle J; Klonoff DC; Makris K; Nichols JH; Pemberton J; Selvin E; Tran NK; Witthauer L; Slingerland RJ,Institut für Diabetes-Technologie; IFCC Scientific Division-Working Group on Continuous Glucose Monitoring,

The non-mucositis participants served as a reference group for microbiome and biomarker assessments (baseline comparison). All participants used the same 0.454% SnF₂ dentifrice (Crest Pro-Health Sensitive and Enamel Shield) and a soft manual toothbrush twice daily throughout the study. Participants received Modified Gingival Index (MGI) and Gingival Bleeding Index (GBI) assessments at Baseline - Day 1 and at Week 4 - Day 1. Subgingival plaque and peri-implant crevicular fluid (PICF) were collected on Baseline - Day 2 and Week 4 - Day 2 for oxidative stress markers, bacterial endotoxins, proinflammatory cytokines and 16S analysis. After 4 weeks, participants with mucositis experienced a significant reduction from baseline in MGI and GBI scores (63.4% and 79.3%, respectively) and in the number of bleeding sites (72.5% based on GBI analysis). Microbiome analysis of subgingival plaque showed that mucositis was associated with a higher relative abundance of disease-associated genera (Fusobacterium, Porphyromonas, Treponema, and Prevotella) and a lower relative abundance of commensal genera (Rothia and Actinomyces). Alpha diversity was higher in the mucositis group compared to the non-mucositis group at baseline. By Week 4, the profile of participants with mucositis had shifted to align more closely with that of non-mucositis participants. Participants with mucositis showed significant reduction in biomarkers related to bacterial insult, plaque virulence, oxidative stress, and inflammation. Simulated pathway and process analysis revealed that multiple categories of genes were associated with a state of mucositis, and 4 weeks of use of the experimental dentifrice downregulated several virulence-associated genes. In participants with mucositis, use of a SnF₂ dentifrice for 4 weeks reduced clinical signs and key biomarkers of peri-implant inflammation and shifted the oral microbiome toward a healthier profile, highlighting the utility of SnF₂ dentifrice in the control of peri-implant mucositis.",Klukoska M; Ramji N; Muñoz Bodnar A; Hu P; Ye H; Xie S; Li L; Ashe J; Reichling T; Wang J; Milleman K; Milleman J,Salus Research Inc.; Procter & Gamble Company,klukowska.m@pg.com.

This observational study aimed to establish normative demographic data in a representative population for an investigational version of QbMobile (QbMobile), a software application for the administration of a performance test to provide objective measurements of hyperactivity, inattention, and impulsivity in the clinical assessment of ADHD. This study was conducted in the United Kingdom, The Netherlands, Germany, and the United States. Participants between 6-60 years were included. The QbMobile application was pre-installed on the smart device/iPhone. Participants were instructed to sit holding the smartphone with both hands and tap the screen each time a target stimulus appeared on-screen and withhold tapping to all other stimuli. The smartphone tracked the participants' movements with the camera and movements from the smartphone to measure activity. A total of 2541 participants completed the study, n=326 aged 6-11 years and n=2215 aged 12-60 years. There were more females (55.7%) than males (44.3%). Demographic and characteristics variables had no impact on the data collected. Household income and educational levels were investigated to ensure sufficient spread across countries. The basic parameters of QbMobile were captured and evaluated during the assessment. There was a high degree of acceptance of the test, and 94% reported that the application was easy to use. Representative normative data for QbMobile was established from a multinational general population and should provide a useful basis as a comparator for other datasets, such as people with ADHD.",Gustafsson U; Nolen R; Casals N; Larsson S; Sanyal R; Hansen M,Qbtech AB; Qbtech,

This study evaluated a novel ingestible medical device (MD) for SI luminal sample collection. A monocentric interventional trial (NCT05477069) was conducted on 15 healthy subjects. Metagenomics, metabolomics and culturomics assessed the MD's effectiveness in characterizing the healthy SI microbiome and identifying potential biomarkers. The SI microbiota differed significantly from the fecal microbiota, displaying high inter-individual variability, lower species richness, and reduced alpha diversity. A combined untargeted and semi-targeted LC-MS/MS metabolomics approach identified a distinct SI metabolic footprint, with bile acids and amino acids being the most abundant classes of metabolites. Host and host/microbe-derived bile acids were particularly abundant in SI samples. The application of a fast culturomics approach to two SI samples enabled species-level characterization, resulting in the identification of 90 bacterial species, including five potential novel species.

One way to accelerate the development of pro-cognitive therapies for schizophrenia is to evaluate compounds using biomarker approaches tailored to relevant neural mechanisms. While D1/D5 receptor (D1R/D5R) agonism has been extensively studied in neuroscience, its therapeutic potential for cognitive impairment in schizophrenia remains untapped. The Translational Neuroscience & Computational Evaluation of a D1R Partial Agonist for Schizophrenia (TRANSCENDS) clinical trial tests this mechanism using a 'target engagement' approach. Multiple, double-blind doses of a D1/D5R partial agonist were administered in advance of a functional neuroimaging (fMRI) session that deployed a cognitive paradigm explicitly designed to capture a translational micro-circuit mechanism underlying spatial working memory in patients with schizophrenia. Specifically, this study will assess whether the D1R/D5R partial agonist CVL-562 induces a dose-dependent engagement of spatial working memory circuits in schizophrenia using fMRI. This design, and the use of spatial working memory neural circuits as a dependent measure, was selected on the basis of a translational and computational understanding of prefrontal micro-circuitry and a mechanistic understanding of the role of D1R/D5Rs in schizophrenia. To enhance data integration and scalability, TRANSCENDS employs an automated informatics framework for seamless neuroimaging data sharing and electronic clinical data capture. This ensures high-standards for regulatory compliance, data quality, and data sharing across sites, improving aspects of current clinical trial data management. We share the study design and approach with the goal of advancing future pro-cognitive drug development and strategies for developing mechanistically-driven biomarkers in psychiatry.",Chakilam S; Gray DL; ,; Vigil Neuroscience; AbbVie Inc.,

More effective neurostimulation treatments are difficult to access and are associated with high hospital delivery costs. Patients would benefit from more efficacious and well-tolerated home-based neurostimulation treatments, which could be self-administered at a frequency required to treat MDD, maintain response, and reduce relapse. A potential novel intervention for MDD is bilateral functional electrical stimulation (FES) of the facial muscles. The portable FES stimulator delivers electrical current to excitable tissues and is suitable for home-based use. Based on the preliminary work demonstrating the feasibility of FES for MDD, the proposed study will develop a viable prototype for a ""take-home"" FES device and perform a proof-of-concept feasibility trial for participants with MDD. This is a single-site, pilot, double-blind, randomized, sham-controlled clinical trial, where 20 participants will receive 20 sessions of FES over 4 weeks. The trial will evaluate the feasibility, tolerability, and safety of home-based FES for MDD. We will also collect data on the preliminary therapeutic effects of FES on depressive symptoms and associated anxiety, quality of life, and sleep. Eligible participants will have three on-site visits including one mask development visit, one mask delivery visit, and one follow-up visit at the end of the study. They will also attend 25 online visits including a screening visit, a baseline visit, 20 days of FES treatment (sham or active), and three post-stimulation follow-up visits. Data obtained from this trial will be used to optimize the home-based FES prototype and design a follow-up, multi-site, large-scale randomized control trial to assess the effectiveness of take-home FES. The existing evidence suggests that FES of the facial muscles can reduce MDD symptoms by enhancing positive facial feedback and altering the interoceptive bias associated with MDD, but its exact mechanism of action is still under debate. Additional trials with neuroimaging outcomes are needed to elucidate the mechanism of action of FES and the corresponding changes in the central nervous system.

Here, we develop an acoustofluidic frequency-associated microsphere embedding platform, which enables microscale rapid injection of microparticles from a fluorinated oil into aqueous droplets. By observing different embedding mechanisms at low and high acoustic frequencies, we establish a theoretical model and practical principles for cross-phase manipulations. The proposed system not only enables multi-phase manipulation but also provides contactless control of specific microparticles within various distinctive phases. We demonstrate the acoustic-driven embedding and subsequent on-demand disassembly of hydrogel microspheres. This system indicates potential for reagent delivery and molecule capture applications. It enhances existing droplet manipulation technologies by enabling both multi-phase and cross-phase operations, paving the way for solid-liquid interaction studies in artificial cell research.

40306759,Anticoagulation in patients with low-burden atrial fibrillation: new evidence focussing on device-detected AF.,,Heart (British Cardiac Society),10.1136/heartjnl-2024-324848,"Stroke, one of the most severe complications of atrial fibrillation (AF), can be prevented by oral anticoagulants in patients with ECG-documented AF and clinical stroke risk factors. Recent controlled trials suggest that reducing the burden of AF, that is, the time spent in AF, can reduce the risk of stroke. Furthermore, stroke rate was slightly lower than anticipated in controlled trials of anticoagulation in screening-detected AF, and substantially lower than expected in patients with device-detected atrial fibrillation (DDAF) and after AF ablation. These data suggest that AF burden modulates the risk of stroke in patients with AF. Based on their high AF burden in observational datasets, anticoagulation remains the default therapy in patients with ECG-documented AF. However, AF burden reduction using rhythm-control therapies emerges as a new treatment strategy for stroke prevention, and there may be a group of patients with such a low burden of AF, for example, patients with DDAF, that the risks of current anticoagulation therapies outweigh their stroke-preventing effects. Patients with DDAF in the absence of ECG-documented AF and without vascular disease appear to be at low risk of thromboembolic events. In patients with DDAF, shared decision-making that considers the presence of vascular disease, potentially the burden of AF if it is very high, and patient preferences currently emerges as good clinical care. More data are needed to robustly define the complex relations between AF burden, phenotypes and stroke risk.",,,p.kirchhof@uke.de.

Because dyspnea is a perception created and interpreted by the central nervous system, it could theoretically be targeted by neuromodulation approaches. This technique is used in pain to modulate the function of neuronal circuits. However, a safe surgical and/or non-invasive modus operandi is not established for refractory dyspnea. Nevertheless, the following literature review will discuss different neuromodulation techniques that may treat refractory dyspnea, even though the understanding of its pathophysiology is limited. More precisely, the diaphragm and its phrenic control, the ventral respiratory complexes (such as Kolliker-Fuse complex and the pre-Bötzinger complex), the vagal nerve, the periaqueductal gray, the insula, the cingular cortex, and the thalamus appear to play an important role in the pathophysiology of breathlessness. Consequently, deep brain stimulation, trigeminal nerve, spinal and vagal nerve stimulations are potentially effective approaches to diminish dyspnea. The discovery of useful dyspnea-reducing neuromodulation techniques could replace or be added to actual treatments like pulmonary rehabilitation, facial ventilators, oxygen, and opioids could be replaced, consequently enhancing the quality of life of dyspneic individuals.",Massé S; St-Pierre J; Delisle T; Vézina FA; Iorio-Morin C; Couillard S,Faculté de Médecine et des Sciences de La Santé,s.couillard@usherbrooke.ca.

Machine learning impacts study design and sample size requirements, but guidance on clinical study design is limited. This study evaluates how neoplasia prevalence, augmented data, and the number of e-nose devices impact sample size requirements. Simulated e-nose breath test data were created using real-world study data. We examined the effect of varying neoplasia prevalence (50%-5%) and data augmentation on model performance, as well as the impact of using multiple devices. Prediction models were developed using single value decomposition and random forest, and convolutional neural networks. Model performance was displayed as area under the receiver operating characteristics curve and F1-score. Stable model performance was defined as the phase where additional data no longer increases model performance. We found that lower neoplasia prevalence significantly increased sample size requirements, with low-prevalence settings (5%) requiring up to five times more data than high-prevalence settings (50%) for stable model performance. Model performance varied between devices, and integrating data from multiple devices required larger sample sizes. Approximately 400 data points per device at 50% prevalence, and 2100 data points at 5% prevalence, were necessary to reach stable model performance. Concluding, sample size requirements for e-nose studies are heavily influenced by disease prevalence and the number of devices used. Limiting device variability and ensuring sufficient case and control samples per device are crucial for achieving reliable predictive performance. Specific requirements will vary based on sensor and disease characteristics.",van Tintelen BFM; Lucas RH,The eNose Company,

Four individuals with SCI/D (median age: 33; 1 female) used the novel pull-function attachment to the manual wheelchair for six weeks. Usability (System Usability Scale; ranging from 1 = 'strongly disagree' to 5 = 'strongly agree') and daily usage time were assessed.

Currently, to limit these effects, frequent replacements of these devices are necessary, resulting in a significant reduction in patients' quality of life and an increase in healthcare costs. To address these challenges, by leveraging recent advancements in robotics and microfluidic technologies, we envision a self-cleaning system for indwelling medical devices equipped with bioinspired ultrasound-activated cilia. These cilia could be regularly activated transcutaneously by ultrasound, generating steady streaming, which can be used to remove encrusted deposits. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that the generated streaming can efficiently remove encrustations and biofilm from surfaces. To this end, we developed a microfluidic model featuring ultrasound-activated cilia on its wall. We showed that upon ultrasound activation, the cilia generated intense, steady streaming, reaching fluid velocity up to 10 mm/s. In all our experiments, this mechanism was able to efficiently clean typical encrustation (calcium carbonate and oxalate) and biofilm found in urological devices. The generated shear forces released, broke apart, and flushed away encrusted deposits. These findings suggest a broad potential for ultrasound-activated cilia in the maintenance of various medical devices. Compared to existing methods, our approach could reduce the need for invasive procedures, potentially lowering infection risks and enhancing patient comfort.",,,

With increasing economic growth, rising life expectancy, and rapid technological advancements, the healthcare needs of the population have surged. This is particularly evident with the rise in chronic diseases, growing healthcare awareness, and the growing demand for personalized care and treatment. Medical devices, which encompass a wide range of machines, instruments, apparatus, and even software, play a vital role in diagnosing, treating, preventing, monitoring, and providing palliative care for various health conditions. Examples include X-ray machines, pacemakers, hip implants, ultrasound machines, glucose metres, prosthetics, and defibrillators. These devices are indispensable in the healthcare continuum across India. However, the development of India's medical device industry faces significant challenges, including limited infrastructure, outdated regulatory frameworks, and an inability to support sustainable growth. The Johnson & Johnson hip implant scandal highlighted the gaps in the existing regulatory system. The current Drugs and Cosmetics Act of 1940 (DCA, 1940) is inadequate in defining medical devices, regulating their import and manufacture, ensuring patient safety, managing adverse event reporting, and holding medical device companies accountable. To address these issues, the Medical Device Rules was introduced by the Government of India in 2017 (MDR, 2017). However, there has been a long-standing need for a more comprehensive legislative framework specifically for medical devices. To this end, the new Drugs, Medical Devices, and Cosmetics Bill of 2022 was proposed to substitute the outdated 1940 Act.

Doctors often lack access to continuous behavioral data, making it difficult to detect deviations from normal patterns when elderly patients arrive for a consultation. Without historical insights into common behaviors and potential anomalies detected with unobtrusive techniques (e.g., non-wearable devices), timely and informed medical interventions become challenging. To address this, we propose an edge-based Internet of Things (IoT) framework that enables real-time monitoring and anomaly detection using non-wearable sensors to assist doctors and caregivers in assessing the health of elderly patients. By processing data locally, the system minimizes privacy concerns and ensures immediate data availability, allowing healthcare professionals to detect unusual behavioral patterns early. The system employs advanced machine learning (ML) models to identify deviations that may indicate potential health risks. A prototype of our system has been developed to test its feasibility and demonstrate, through the application of two of the most frequently used ML models, i.e., isolation forest and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, that it can provide scalability, efficiency, and reliability in the context of elderly care. Further, the provided dashboard enables caregivers and healthcare professionals to access real-time alerts and longitudinal trends, facilitating proactive interventions. The proposed approach improves healthcare responsiveness by providing instant insights into patient behavior, facilitating more accurate diagnoses and interventions.

It is suitable for various applications. Much research has already focused on wearable device-based HGR. By contrast, this paper gives an overview focused on device-free HGR. That means we evaluate HGR systems that do not require the user to wear something like a data glove or hold a device. HGR systems are explored regarding technology, hardware, and algorithms. The interconnectedness of timing and power requirements with hardware, pre-processing algorithm, classification, and technology and how they permit more or less granularity, accuracy, and number of gestures is clearly demonstrated. Sensor modalities evaluated are WIFI, vision, radar, mobile networks, and ultrasound. The pre-processing technologies stereo vision, multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO), spectrogram, phased array, range-doppler-map, range-angle-map, doppler-angle-map, and multilateration are explored. Classification approaches with and without ML are studied. Among those with ML, assessed algorithms range from simple tree structures to transformers. All applications are evaluated taking into account their level of integration. This encompasses determining whether the application presented is suitable for edge integration, their real-time capability, whether continuous learning is implemented, which robustness was achieved, whether ML is applied, and the accuracy level. Our survey aims to provide a thorough understanding of the current state of the art in device-free HGR on edge devices and in general.

Levodopa (l-dopa) is a mainstay of therapy and is typically followed by the addition of a catechol- A medical research summary on how use the drug safinamide in Asian patients with Parkinson’s disease Parkinson’s disease is a growing problem in Asia as populations age. The treatment approach in Asia is similar to other parts of the world, even though Parkison’s disease might affect Asian patients differently. A common treatment is Levodopa (L-dopa), often combined with other drugs to address ‘wear-off’ effects, which occur when L-dopa stops working before the next dose. This article focuses on safinamide, a drug used with L-dopa to manage Parkinson’s disease. Asian neurologists reviewed studies to find the best ways to use safinamide in Asian patients. Research shows that safinamide helps reduce wear-off effects, improves movement, and eases some non-movement symptoms like bladder issues and sleep problems. Safinamide is well tolerated, works well for older patients, and may lower the risk of unwanted movements (dyskinesias) in long-term treatment. The authors recommend safinamide as an option for managing Parkinson’s disease in Asian patients. However, they call for more research on its effects on pain, the right doses, and how it works for younger patients with Parkinson’s disease.",,,

A cost-utility analysis consisting of a decision tree and Markov cohort designed to calculate the difference in costs and health outcomes between two scenarios: (1) disease-modifying treatment (DMT) for SMA after diagnosis through NBS, and (2) DMT for SMA after diagnosis as symptoms appear. A population of 295,906 newborns was modeled, based on the total number of live births in Australia in 2023. Inputs included screening parameters, epidemiology inputs, SMA natural history data and DMT parameters (nusinersen and onasemnogene abeparvovec), costs, and health-related quality of life parameters. Assumed participation in NBS was 100%. A one-way sensitivity analysis and probabilistic sensitivity analysis were conducted to examine the impact of parameter uncertainty. There were 30 patients identified with SMA, of whom 25 patients would be eligible for presymptomatic treatment. NBS for SMA was dominant compared with no NBS for SMA. On a population level, NBS demonstrated a lifetime gain of 267 quality-adjusted life years (QALY) and incremental costs of -AUD$3,983,263 (i.e., cost savings). Every dollar invested in NBS would save hospitals $3.69. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses demonstrated the robustness of the base-case results. NBS for SMA was dominant compared with no NBS for SMA in Australia from a state and territory payer perspective. Universal implementation of NBS for SMA would support access equity, as well as early diagnosis and treatment in infants with SMA, potentially leading to improved outcomes.",Adams J; Bischof M,Novartis Pharmaceuticals Australia; Novartis Pharma AG,Ian.Woodcock@rch.org.au.

High serum phosphate in CKD increases calcification propensity via generation of circulating calciprotein particles (CPP2), crystalline nanoaggregates composed of calcium, phosphate, and serum proteins. CPP2 induce vascular calcification in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) in vitro. In vivo, endothelial cells, rather than VSMCs are primarily exposed to CPP2, yet understanding the influence of endothelial cells on vascular calcification is limited. We investigated calcification-promoting signalling by endothelial cells on VSMCs. Effects of CPP2 exposure to endothelial cells on CPP2 uptake, endothelial cell activation, and endothelial cell-derived secretome were studied. Effects of the secretome on VSMC calcification were investigated. Using NanoString nCounter analysis the effects of CPP2-activated endothelial cell-conditioned medium on VSMCs gene expression were mapped. Endothelial cells internalise CPP2 and elevate ICAM-1, E-selectin, and VCAM-1-mRNA expression, indicating endothelial activation. VSMCs cultured in conditioned medium from CPP2-activated endothelial cells demonstrated enhanced calcification, suggesting that CPP2-activated endothelial cells release pro-calcifying soluble factors. Mass spectrometry was utilized to identify 1171 proteins in the CPP2-activated endothelial cells' secretome. Among these, 76 proteins were differentially expressed compared to control endothelial cells' secretome, including proteins related to blood vessel development, extracellular matrix remodelling, and oxidative stress-related processes. Finally, endothelial cell-derived paracrine factors present in conditioned medium enhanced mRNA-expression of calcification-related factors in VSMCs. CPP2-activated endothelial cells promote VSMC calcification via paracrine signalling. In response to these paracrine factors, VSMCs increase the expression of pro-calcification genes.",Bernay B; Chatre L; ,Université de Caen Normandie; ; Normandie Univ,j.l.hillebrands@umcg.nl.

However, inter-phantom variability may affect the reliability of these metrics, especially for inter-system comparisons. The aim of this study was to quantify the intra- and inter-phantom variability of IQ metrics using a set of theoretically identical phantoms. Twenty-four TORMAS phantoms were imaged ten times each using a mammography unit under standardized high-dose conditions. Images were analyzed using automated software to extract 64 IQ metrics, including contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) as well as modulation transfer function (MTF)-related and other metrics. Outliers were identified and excluded. Variability was assessed by calculating intra- and inter-phantom variances and coefficients of variation (COVs). The relative contributions of intra- and inter-phantom variability to total variability were also determined. Two defective phantoms were excluded. Analysis of 64 IQ metrics across 22 phantoms showed higher inter-phantom variability compared to intra-phantom variability. Mean intra- and inter-phantom COVs were 6.9% and 15.1% for the 34 CNR metrics, 4.8% and 5.4% for the 5 MTF-related metrics, 0.14% and 0.75% for the 10 contrast metrics, 4.9% and 14.8% for the 15 noise metrics, respectively. Inter-phantom variability contributed 84.2% to total variability, highlighting its dominance. Inter-phantom variability significantly affects IQ metrics, emphasizing the importance of using the same phantom for inter-system comparisons to avoid confounding results. Conversely, phantoms are well-suited for assessing system reproducibility over time, focus on inter-system variability while consistently using a single phantom. This study highlights the significant impact of inter-phantom variability on image quality assessment, emphasizing the importance of using the same phantom for benchmarking imaging systems. These findings are crucial for optimizing quality control protocols and ensuring reliable, reproducible evaluations. Inter-phantom variability exceeded intra-phantom variability across all image quality metrics of digital mammography. Subtle details showed higher total variability compared to more distinct features. Modulation transfer function metrics exhibited comparable intra- and inter-phantom variability, highlighting positioning sensitivity. Inter-phantom variability contributes 84% to total variability, impacting imaging system comparisons.

40281628,Development and evaluation of a non-invasive brain-spine interface using transcutaneous spinal cord stimulation.,2025-04-26,Journal of neuroengineering and rehabilitation,10.1186/s12984-025-01628-6,"Motor rehabilitation is a therapeutic process to facilitate functional recovery in people with spinal cord injury (SCI). However, its efficacy is limited to areas with remaining sensorimotor function. Spinal cord stimulation (SCS) creates a temporary prosthetic effect that may allow further rehabilitation-induced recovery in individuals without remaining sensorimotor function, thereby extending the therapeutic reach of motor rehabilitation to individuals with more severe injuries. In this work, we report our first steps in developing a non-invasive brain-spine interface (BSI) based on electroencephalography (EEG) and transcutaneous spinal cord stimulation (tSCS). The objective of this study was to identify EEG-based neural correlates of lower limb movement in the sensorimotor cortex of unimpaired individuals (N = 17) and to quantify the performance of a linear discriminant analysis (LDA) decoder in detecting movement onset from these neural correlates. Our results show that initiation of knee extension was associated with event-related desynchronization in the central-medial cortical regions at frequency bands between 4 and 44 Hz. Our neural decoder using µ (8-12 Hz), low β (16-20 Hz), and high β (24-28 Hz) frequency bands achieved an average area under the curve (AUC) of 0.83 ± 0.06 s.d. (n = 7) during a cued movement task offline. Generalization to imagery and uncued movement tasks served as positive controls to verify robustness against movement artifacts and cue-related confounds, respectively. With the addition of real-time decoder-modulated tSCS, the neural decoder performed with an average AUC of 0.81 ± 0.05 s.d. (n = 9) on cued movement and 0.68 ± 0.12 s.d. (n = 9) on uncued movement. Our results suggest that the decrease in decoder performance in uncued movement may be due to differences in underlying cortical strategies between conditions. Furthermore, we explore alternative applications of the BSI system by testing neural decoders trained on uncued movement and imagery tasks. By developing a non-invasive BSI, tSCS can be timed to be delivered only during voluntary effort, which may have implications for improving rehabilitation.",,,ismaelseanez@wustl.edu.

However, the optimal dose parameters for TMS interventions targeting suicidal ideation in adolescents remain unknown. This exploratory study examined the impact of 1 Hz and 10 Hz TMS treatment on suicidal ideation in adolescents with major depressive disorder. Participants (N = 41) aged 12-18 years were randomized to TMS treatments with 1 Hz or 10 Hz frequency over 6 weeks and included in the exploratory analyses. The change in the intensity of suicidal ideation throughout treatment was estimated with ordinal logistic regression models with and without adjustments for the change in depressive symptom severity. The predicted odds of intensity of suicidal ideation significantly decreased over six-weeks of acute TMS treatment for both the 10 Hz TMS group (OR = 0.754, 95 % CI = 0.634 to 0.897, p = 0.0015) and the 1 Hz TMS group (OR = 0.780, 95 % CI = 0.668 to 0.909, p = 0.0016). However, after adjustment for the change in depression severity as a time-varying covariate in the ordinal logistic regression model, the magnitude of the decrease (or predicted odds) in intensity of suicidal ideation was attenuated and rendered non-significant for both the 10 Hz and 1 Hz TMS groups. TMS treatment suicidal ideation outcomes were not significantly different between the 10 Hz and 1 Hz TMS groups. Low-frequency TMS may be as effective as high-frequency TMS in treating suicidal ideation in adolescents with depression.

However, the DTP is highly susceptible to variations in dimensional and external environmental factors, and the spectral response is mismatched from preparation in air to application in a liquid environment, making the DTP difficult to control effectively. In this work, we propose a method that bridges the relationship between the interference spectra of air and aqueous environments. By counting the interference peaks in air, we can accurately predict the DTP position in liquids. Meanwhile, it provides a new balance between sensitivity and wide linear dynamic range, achieving wide dynamic range detection across various concentrations. The optical microfiber coupler (OMC) is fabricated using the hydrogen-oxygen flame melting tapering method. In addition, the concentration, temperature, and solvent used for the sensor's biofunctional layer are optimized. Finally, in refractive index sensing, a maximum sensitivity of 1.17 × 105 ± 0.038 × 105 nm/RIU is achieved.

Most of LFT devices were based on nitrocellulose membrane strips whose industrial upscaling to billions of devices has already been extensively demonstrated. Nevertheless, the assay option in an LFT format is largely restricted to qualitative detection of the target antigens. In this research, we surveyed the potential of UV nanoimprint lithography (UV-NIL) and extrusion coating (EC) for the high-throughput production of disposable capillary-driven, foil-based tests that allow multistep assays to be implemented for quantitative readout to address the inherent lack of on-demand fluid control and sensitivity of paper-based devices. Both manufacturing technologies operate on the principle of imprinting that enables high-volume, continuous structuring of microfluidic patterns in a roll-to-roll (R2R) production scheme. To demonstrate the feasibility of R2R-fabricated foil chips in a point-of-care biosensing application, we adapted a commercial chemiluminescence multiplex test for COVID-19 antibody detection originally developed for a capillary-driven microfluidic chip manufactured with injection molding (IM). In an effort to build a complete ecosystem for the R2R manufacturing of foil chips, we also recruited additional processes to streamline chip production: R2R biofunctionalization and R2R lamination. Compared to conventional fabrication techniques for microfluidic devices, the R2R techniques highlighted in this work offer unparalleled advantages concerning improved scalability, dexterity of seamless handling, and significant cost reduction. Our preliminary evaluation indicated that the foil chips exhibited comparable performance characteristics to the original IM-fabricated devices. This early success in assay translation highlights the promise of implementing biochemical assays on R2R-manufactured foil chips.

Among its various implementations, photoacoustic microscopy (PAM) achieves micrometer-scale resolution by focusing laser excitation and detecting ultrasonic signals, allowing for the detailed visualization of microvascular structures and fine tissue morphology. Over the last decade, PAM imaging speed has significantly increased by adopting PA scanners that steer optical and acoustic waves. However, these scanners must be placed after focusing optics to co-align the waves on a spot, which creates bent focal lines along the scanning direction and limits the scanning range. To achieve wide-field imaging, various image mosaic algorithms have been applied, but these methods require multiple manual operations, which take more time than the imaging itself. In this study, we developed a wide-field, high-speed scanning acoustic/photoacoustic microscopy (SA/PAM) system equipped with a transparent ultrasound transducer and a moving magnet linear stage, which eliminates the need for complex mosaic algorithms.

Despite the rapid growth of the EV industry, research on circular economy (CE) managerial approaches to battery disposal remains limited. This study addresses this gap by examining the current EV battery technology practices through the lens of the ReSOLVE framework. As this is an exploratory study, we have employed a qualitative methodology, gathering data from EV practitioners, OEMs, suppliers, logistics providers, and recyclers in the US, Europe, and China, augmented by additional literature reviews. Our analysis has revealed process and competency gaps in current battery disposal practices. We have developed a conceptual ReSOLVE framework specific to EV battery disposal, demonstrating a strong link between CE motivations, CE-enabling business practices, CE design systems, and business performance. Based on our analysis, we have suggested that new managerial procedures for handling rejected batteries and enhanced inter-organizational relationships are vital for CE implementation. We have proposed that CE motivations drive responsible business practices and CE-enabling design systems, which in turn improve business and sustainability performance in the EV and LIB industry. These results emphasize the importance of a holistic, CE-driven management approach to EV battery disposal.",Balakrishnan AS,Material Planning and Logistics,abalakri2006@gmail.com.
40273790,An evolutionary game modeling to develop recycling strategy of used batteries of new energy vehicles: implications for circular economy.,2025-05-13,Journal of environmental management,10.1016/j.jenvman.2025.125293,"With the booming development of the new energy industry, lithium batteries are being widely used in electric vehicles, mobile devices, and other applications. However, the disposal of used lithium batteries is a growing concern. Focusing on the circular economy, this paper comprehensively considers a range of actors and factors that may affect the recycling process for used batteries from new energy vehicles (NEVs); constructs a four-party evolutionary game model comprising the central government, the local government, NEV enterprises, and third-party used battery recycling companies (hereinafter referred to as third-party recycling companies); provides an evolutionarily stable solution in different situations by analyzing the evolutionary system; and explores factors that impact the selection of an appropriate strategy through numerical simulation. Our conclusions are as follows: (1) The recycling of used batteries from NEVs requires cooperation between NEV enterprises and third-party recycling companies to effectively improve the recycling efficiency of used batteries. (2) The strategy of NEV enterprises and third-party recycling companies choosing to cooperate to achieve used battery recycling has a greater impact than the actions of central and local governments. Whether enterprises can continue to cooperate in used battery recycling depends more on the willingness of both parties, while the government's promotional policies can only influence the enterprises' initial willingness to cooperate in the early stage of the process. (3) If there is a significant inequality in the distribution of benefits between the central and local governments in the recycling of used batteries from NEVs, the enthusiasm of local governments to achieve such recycling will be weakened, which may lead to the adoption of negative attitudes. (4) In the early stage of the cooperative recycling of used batteries from NEVs, the ""active management"" strategy of central and local governments plays a more critical role. In the middle and late stages, the influence of the governmental strategy gradually diminishes, and central and local governments may no longer be inclined to adopt the ""active management"" approach due to cost-effectiveness considerations. This paper demonstrates that studying the recycling of used new energy batteries can help to improve economic efficiency and promote the development of a circular economy, as well as bring new business opportunities for related industry chains.",,,thunder0401@163.com.

Recently, robotic interventions have been suggested to be applied in orthopaedic rehabilitation with upper extremity disorders, especially those related to hand and wrist. This study aims to determine the effectiveness of combined conventional therapy and HAL-SJ robotic therapy in restoring the wrist functionality following the fractures as compared to the standard conventional therapy solely. Workers with wrist fractures will be randomized in two groups, i.e., the control group (conventional therapy) and intervention group (combination of conventional therapy and robotic HAL-SJ intervention). All participants will receive 5-day/week therapy sessions for four weeks. Primary outcomes of the Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH) outcome measure and secondary outcomes of range of motion, grip and pinch strengths, fine and gross hand dexterity as well as pain and the Lam Assessment of Stages of Employment Readiness (LASER) will be assessed at baseline assessment and upon completion of the therapy program after 4 weeks. Data from the baseline and post intervention outcome measures will be analysed using a Repeated Measures ANOVA to compare the therapy effectiveness of both control and intervention groups. Participants recruitment and data collection are in progress. Wrist fractures can produce some residual disability and pain that may impact the functionality of a person. The application of robotic technology in facilitating upper limb movement and functional recovery training is extensive and shows positive outcomes in the field of neurorehabilitation. However, there is a lacking of published evidence about the effectiveness of robotic intervention in orthopaedic rehabilitation, especially in the field of hand therapy.

A cross-sectional study was conducted through a retrospective review of electronic medical records from onsite clinics at a South Korean semiconductor company. The study focused on employees who visited the onsite clinics between 2013 and 2016 due to the risk of chronic diseases including hypertension, diabetes, and dyslipidemia. Descriptive statistics assessed clinic utilization and adherence, while multivariable logistic regression identified influencing factors, adjusted for age, sex, work type, work shift, workplace, specific onsite clinic, diagnosis, and disease duration. Out of the 39,073 employees examined, 8,837 sought care at onsite clinics for managing chronic disease risks. The majority of these participants were male (88.2%) and predominantly aged in their 30s and 40s (84.6%). Among these individuals, 33.0% visited the clinics five or more times, and 28.5% filled prescriptions on two or more occasions. Chronic diseases were the second most common reason for onsite clinic visits. The average adherence to prescription as measured by the Proportion of Days Covered (PDC) was 0.61, with 40% of individuals showing a high adherence. Notably, older age and employment at workplaces located outside metropolitan areas were significant factors positively associated with both the utilization of onsite clinic services and adherence to prescribed treatments. This study found that onsite clinics within a semiconductor company were actively utilized for managing chronic diseases, particularly among older employees and those in workplaces located in areas where medical access is limited compared to metropolitan areas. These findings highlight the potential role of onsite clinics in enhancing chronic disease management. Future research across a broader range of workplaces could further support and expand these insights.",,,

The upgrade to recipient model (U2R) involves the transfer of patient data to a cloud where the company that supplies the upgraded processor can upload it into the devices and dispatch them directly to the patient. It replaces the traditional face to face model, requiring patients to come into the clinic. Four clinics in the U.K. and one in the Netherlands were surveyed on their experiences and satisfaction levels after implementing this model. The time saved when using the U2R model was compared to the time taken for a face-to-face appointment. Upgrades were done using the U2R model in 43% of adults and children. Time savings ranged between 21 and 65 minutes per patient. Although patients were reported to be satisfied with the service, up to 50% of U2R patients requested a further in clinic follow up appointment. Four out of five clinics were satisfied with the current U2R model and would recommend it to another clinic. The other clinic required modifications to the administration of the model. Large savings in clinic and patients costs and time were reported. Streamlining the process within clinics and providing better remote support for patient reassurance and to solve equipment issues at home would ensure that time savings are maximised and the B2C model provides comparable quality to an in-clinic appointment.",Fuller A; O'Driscoll M; Soulby A; Greenham P,Hearing Implant Centre; The Richard Ramsden Centre for Auditory Implants; Greenham Research Consulting Ltd.,

Once diagnosed, treatment is generally limited to intravenous thrombolysis (IVT), endovascular thrombectomy, or both. Intravenous thrombolysis has theoretical benefits (enhancing reperfusion, dissolving smaller thrombi) and harms (delaying time to endovascular intervention, allergic reaction, increased bleeding risk). To assess the effects of endovascular thrombectomy with IVT versus without IVT on functional independence (defined as a modified Rankin Scale score (mRS) < 3) within 90 days in people with acute ischaemic stroke. We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, Scopus, LILACS, Google Scholar, the International HTA database, and two trial registries to November 2023. We included randomised controlled trials of adults with acute ischaemic stroke who received endovascular therapy and were randomised to either intravenous thrombolysis within 4.5 hours or a control. Outcomes were: functional independence (mRS score < 3), excellent functional outcome (mRS score < 2), mortality, asymptomatic intracranial haemorrhage, symptomatic intracranial haemorrhage, successful revascularisation (thrombolysis in cerebral infarction (TICI) grades 2b to 3), and complete revascularisation (TICI grade 3 only), within 90 days. We used the Cochrane RoB 2 tool to assess the following potential sources of bias for each outcome: bias arising from the randomisation process; bias due to deviations from intended interventions; bias due to missing outcome data; bias in measurement of the outcome; and bias in selection of the reported result. We pooled outcome data using the random-effects model and performed meta-analyses using the Mantel-Haenszel method. We assessed the statistical heterogeneity of pooled data by visually inspecting forest plots to consider the direction and magnitude of effects, and used the Chi We included six studies, with a total of 2336 participants (1166 control and 1170 intervention). The mean age was 71 years. There were 1034 women and 1302 men. Four studies used alteplase 0.9 mg/kg, one study used alteplase 0.6 mg/kg, and one study used either alteplase 0.9 mg/kg or tenecteplase 0.25 mg/kg. There were no important variations in the outcomes reported across studies. All six studies were at overall low risk of bias for each outcome. There was probably little to no difference in functional independence between the IVT and control groups (risk ratio (RR) 1.03, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.92 to 1.14; P = 0.62; 6 studies, 2336 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). There was no evidence of a difference in excellent functional outcome between the IVT and control groups (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.05; P = 0.67; 6 studies, 2336 participants; high-certainty evidence). There was no evidence of a difference in mortality between the IVT and control groups (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.14; P = 0.54; 6 studies, 2336 participants; high-certainty evidence). There was no evidence of a difference in asymptomatic intracranial haemorrhage between the IVT and control groups (RR 1.13, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.29; P = 0.06; 6 studies, 2334 participants; high-certainty evidence). There was probably little to no difference in symptomatic intracranial haemorrhage between the IVT and control groups (RR 1.20, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.70; P = 0.31; 6 studies, 2336 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). There was a higher rate of successful revascularisation with IVT over control (RR 1.04, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.08; P = 0.008; 6 studies, 2326 participants; high-certainty evidence). There was a higher rate of complete revascularisation with IVT over control (RR 1.14, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.28; P = 0.02; 5 studies, 2037 participants; high-certainty evidence). Limitations included: differences in inclusion and exclusion criteria between studies (e.g. age thresholds, pre-existing comorbidities or baseline functional status, time periods, diagnostic imaging, specific vessels); specific endovascular device used; thrombolysis medication and dose; and potential conflict of interest, as multiple study authors reported receiving funding or fees from pharmaceutical companies. For functional independence, assessed as an mRS score < 3 within 90 days, we downgraded the certainty of evidence by one level due to a high I The evidence does not currently support a clear benefit or harm for routine intravenous thrombolysis amongst people receiving endovascular thrombectomy. Amongst participants receiving endovascular thrombectomy, IVT did not demonstrate evidence of a difference in functional independence, excellent functional outcome, mortality, and asymptomatic intracranial haemorrhage, or symptomatic intracranial haemorrhage, when compared with no IVT. However, IVT did result in a higher rate of successful and complete revascularisation when compared with no IVT. Future research should include more high-quality trials to further evaluate the role of intravenous thrombolysis in people receiving endovascular thrombectomy to provide more robust data and further narrow the confidence intervals. Future research should also identify whether time- and person-specific factors influence the effect of IVT amongst those receiving endovascular thrombectomy.

40271329,Effects of Belt Electrode-Skeletal Muscle Electrical Stimulation on Lower-Extremity Muscle Temperature.,,Cureus,10.7759/cureus.81105,"Introduction Warm-ups are essential for optimizing physiological readiness before physical activity, and active warm-up methods increase muscle temperature and neuromuscular activation. However, excessive exertion can lead to fatigue. Belt electrode-skeletal muscle electrical stimulation (B-SES) enhances muscle flexibility and prevents atrophy; however, its effectiveness in increasing muscle temperature as a passive warm-up strategy remains unclear. Therefore, we aimed to examine the effects of B-SES on lower limb muscle temperature. Methods This cross-sectional study comprised 20 healthy adults randomly assigned to either a low-frequency (LF; 4 Hz) or high-frequency (HF; 20 Hz) B-SES condition. Electrical stimulation was applied to the dominant lower extremity for 10 min, and the muscle temperature was measured every minute during and after stimulation. Temperature changes over time and between groups were analyzed using repeated-measures two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). Repeated-measures one-way ANOVAs were conducted as post hoc analyses. Results Muscle temperature significantly increased over time in LF and HF conditions (p < 0.01), starting from 2 min of stimulation (at 2 min, LF: 0.24 ± 0.04℃; HF: 0.18 ± 0.04℃). However, no significant differences were observed between the two stimulation conditions (p = 0.09). The median fatigue rating on the visual analog scale was 31.5 mm (interquartile range, 14.8-60.8 mm). Conclusion B-SES effectively increased the muscle temperature within a short duration, suggesting its potential as an efficient passive warm-up method. Further research is required to explore its functional benefits in athletic performance and rehabilitation settings.",,,

We performed a multicenter, randomized, waitlist-controlled study. The intervention group (IG) received the 12-week program, followed by 12 weeks with usual care. The control group (CG) received usual care only. The main components of the 12-week program were: (1) a tailored home-based exercise prescription, (2) e-learning resources, (3) telephone and video meetings with an exercise therapist, (4) the provision of a consumer-based PA monitor. Measurements were taken at baseline, postintervention, and after 24 weeks. The primary outcome was device-measured steps/day. Other outcomes were device-measured moderate-to-vigorous physical activity, subjectively measured leisure-time and transportation physical activity and sport/exercise, physical activity-related health competence, walking ability, quality of life, fatigue, depression, and PA-related self-concordance. We compared changes from baseline to postintervention between groups and analyzed changes in the IG during the follow-up. Analysis of 56 persons with multiple sclerosis (IG: n = 29, CG: n = 27, age: 45.6 ± 10.9) revealed no significant intervention effect on steps/day. However, significant improvements were observed in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity, sport/exercise, control competence, fatigue, and quality of life (physical).

Organs on chips offer a promising alternative, but widespread use of polydimethylsiloxane introduces challenges due to its sorption of small lipophilic molecules, distorting pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data. Cyclic olefin copolymer, a chemically stable alternative with minimal sorption, has emerged as a potential solution. This study investigates the sorption behavior of seven pharmaceutically active compounds in microfluidic devices and washout of these compounds, using high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry to evaluate recovery of compounds. Lipophilic molecules exhibited substantial sorption in polydimethylsiloxane and lower retention in cyclic olefin copolymer. Imipramine (logP = 4.80) decreased from 100 µM to 0.0384 µM for polydimethylsiloxane and 31.5 µM for cyclic olefin copolymer after 24 h incubation. Sorption was governed by multiple factors - lipophilicity and rotatable bond count were critical for both materials, hydrogen bond acceptors and molecular weight played a larger role in cyclic olefin copolymer, whereas topological polar surface area was critical for polydimethylsiloxane. Washout studies revealed that polydimethylsiloxane retains lipophilic compounds through bulk absorption, causing slow release, while cyclic olefin copolymer facilitated easier desorption. The cumulative sum of the first 5 h washout of loperamide (logP = 5.13) is 37.8% for polydimethylsiloxane and 71.5% for cyclic olefin copolymer. These findings highlight the importance of material selection and molecular properties in minimizing sorption and ensuring reliable experimental outcomes especially in microfluidic systems with distinctly different surface to volume ratios to other models.",Grindulis K; Rimsa R; Mozolevskis G,Cellbox Labs,roberts.rimsa@cellboxlabs.com.

The ability to offer consumers unprecedented access to vital signs, advanced biomarkers, and environmental data enables a host of new capabilities to fill gaps in existing knowledge and permit individualized insights and education. Continuous monitoring enables individualized insights, emphasizing the need for a redefinition of health and human performance that is decentralized, dynamic, and personalized. The challenge lies in managing the massive amounts of continuous wearable data, necessitating new definitions of health data and secure practices. The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the adoption of digitalized consumer-facing diagnostics and software, transforming the traditional patient role. Consumers now have the tools to identify and understand an impending or existing disease state before they encounter traditional health care delivery health systems, making self-diagnosis commonplace. This shift empowers consumers to actively participate in their health, contributing to a new era where patients are in control of their well-being, from wellness to disease. Physicians in 2025 will engage with more informed and educated consumers, leveraging advanced analytic tools for diagnostics and streamlined patient management. Wearable devices play a pivotal role in enhancing patient engagement, while virtual reality and tailored software can be used by physicians to offer immersive learning experiences about conditions or upcoming procedures. Clinician decision support models and virtual care solutions will contribute to recruiting and maintaining health care providers amid a growing workforce shortage. Health care delivery organizations are transforming to improve outcomes at a lower cost, with partnerships with digital technology companies enabling innovative care models.

We thus aimed at developing a simple and sensitive peptide array that operates with more cost-effective ECL detection, so that it can be routinely used in clinical practice. For this purpose, instead of directly immobilizing the peptides onto the microarray surface as in the previous reports, we developed a two-step immobilization technique using microbeads. Peptides biotinylated at the N-terminal are first bound to microbeads with streptavidin (sAV) on the surface, followed by immobilization of the peptide-bound beads onto the microarray substrate using the photoreactive crosslinker. In this way, we were able to overcome the limitations of direct immobilization in increasing the amount and accessibility of peptides and greatly enhance the sensitivity so that ECL detection became possible. In the present study, we analyzed sera from cow's milk allergy (CMA) patients with our peptide array containing 20 peptides from αS1-casein.

We used the rules to categorize patients in BALANCE into different risk groups and calculated the unadjusted absolute risk difference (RD) for 90-day mortality in patients receiving 7- vs 14-day antibiotics within each risk group. Statistical significance was tested using an interaction test. The BALANCE trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT03005145). 3581 patients were included. All three rules predicted mortality risk, but none identified statistically significant effect modification: (a) static rule (low-risk: RD -0.58, 95% CI -8.91 to 7.73; moderate-risk: RD -.01, 95% CI -3.86 to 1.83; high-risk: RD -2.65, 95% CI -7.12 to 1.81; p = 0.74); (b) dynamic rule (met rule on day 7: RD -2.18, 95% CI -4.81 to 0.45; did not meet rule: RD 1.75, 95% CI -3.89 to 7.40; p = 0.16); and (c) early clinical failure criteria (score<2: RD -2.38, 95% CI -5.0 to 0.23; score ≥2: RD -0.65, 95% CI -5.06 to 3.77; p = 0.24). Results were consistent across sensitivity analyses including imputation for missing data and restricting analyses to gram-negative BSI.

This study aims to evaluate the possible positive effects of innovative gluten-free flatbread, containing grape and apple antioxidant-rich by-products, on the gut microbiota of patients with metabolic syndrome. The baked products were subjected to gastric digestion using the Infogest system, followed by proximal colonic fermentation in the MICODE (Multi-Unit In vitro Colon Model) intestinal model, where three samplings were performed (baseline, after 16 h and 24 h). The samples were then subjected to 16S rRNA metataxonomy, quantification of shifts in bacterial populations by qPCR analysis and characterization of volatile organic compounds by SPME GC-MS (Solid Phase Micro Extraction Gas-Chromatography Mass-Spectrophotometry). A robust statistical approach based on several tests and multivariate analysis was applied. The results obtained demonstrated the in vitro potential of functional flatbreads in improving the dysbiosis of the microbiota of individuals with metabolic syndrome, due to a reduction in the Firmicutes/Bacteroidota ratio, and highlighted an increase in commensal microorganisms (Bifidobacterium, positive clostridia and Akkermansia muciniphila) and a reduction in negative microorganisms (Enterobacteriaceae, negative clostridia and Collinsella spp.). The analysis of metabolites showed an increase in health-beneficial metabolites (acetate and medium chain organic acids) and a reduction in harmful metabolites (p-cresol and skatole), the degree of this modulation varied based on the flatbread composition. While this study employed an in vitro model of recognized limitations, it nonetheless provides valuable, evidence-based results that can be used for preclinical screening of formulations. Anyhow this work is of high fashion in this running time as it proposes i) in vitro models rather than animal testing; ii) human MetS gut microbiota for high translatability to in vivo condition; iii) approaches of precise and personalized nutrition by the use of specific microbiota and omic technologies, all component that vow to be the future of food assessment.",Marin V; Cardone G; Mancini E; Magni M; Pichler A; Ciani S; Polenghi O; Cerne VL,Private Nutritional Clinic; Laimburg Research Centre; Dr. Schär R&D Centre,andrea.gianotti@unibo.it.

The research aimed to isolate, molecularly type, and assess the antifungal susceptibility of superficial fungal infection agents associated with PPE use. Additionally, the relationship between these fungi and PPE use was evaluated through a questionnaire. Samples were collected from 100 healthcare workers experiencing skin issues. Among them, all N95/FFP2 mask users, 44.3% of glove users, 36.1% of surgical mask users, and 22.9% of hair cap users reported skin reactions, with acne (n = 34) being the most common. Identified fungal isolates included Trametes hirsuta, Penicillium chrysogenum, Aspergillus fumigatus, Rhodotorula sp., Candida sp., Pichia fermentans, and the dermatophyte Microsporum ferrugineum. Antifungal susceptibility tests revealed 47.6% resistance to fluconazole and 76.2% resistance to voriconazole (n = 16). This study provides the first institutional data on PPE-associated fungal infections and antifungal resistance in healthcare settings. These findings highlight the dermatological risks of prolonged PPE use. To mitigate these effects, healthcare institutions should prioritize high-quality materials, establish optimal usage guidelines, and provide continuous training on self-protection.",,,derya.berikten@ksbu.edu.tr.

Wearable pressure- and motion-sensing insoles have opened new possibilities for accessible gait analysis in real-life conditions. This study evaluated the equivalence of FeetMe insole measurements of gait parameters to those of a laboratory gold standard, optoelectronic motion capture system coupled to force platforms (MoCap/FP). Gait and posture parameters were assessed in 37 healthy adults by FeetMe insoles and by MoCap/FP system simultaneously. Means and variances were compared, and inter-device agreement was assessed for each parameter. Between-device equivalence was demonstrated for all parameters assessed (two one-sided t tests: P < .001). For static parameters, six of 13 variables presented excellent interclass correlation coefficients (ICCs ≥ 0.90) and three had good ICCs (≥ 0.75 to < 0.90). Moreover, 10 of 11 spatiotemporal parameters showed excellent accuracy (ICCs ≥ 0.90), and three of four kinetic parameters showed moderate-to-good accuracy (ICCs between 0.78 and 0.89). In summary, FeetMe can be considered as a valid gait measurement tool compared to the high precision MoCap/FP system and could be used in clinical practice to assess a wide range of gait and posture parameters, overcoming some limitations of traditional systems.",Huang P; Mostovov A; Cohen R; Cadilhac C; Pionnier R,Hôpitaux Paris-Est Val de Marne; FeetMe SAS,raphael.pionnier@chu-nimes.fr.

However, these employees are also exposed to numerous other hazards in their workplace that may have long- and short-term health impacts. The potential adverse impact must be assessed and risk managed by companies working with a Contract Medical Advisor (CMA) assigned to the works via a Hazard Identification and Risk Assessment (HIRA) process. The appointed CMA should visit the work site to be in a position to provide adequate input into a workplace health and safety plan by directly participating in that HIRA process. A detailed analysis follows to determine whether medical surveillance would be required for hazards that are considered potential health risks. This process is reviewed with practical examples from the literature. This review does not intend to comprehensively cover all workplace hazards and risks to health associated with diving and hyperbaric operations. It aims to introduce aspects of occupational medicine and HIRA processes to Diving Medical Examiners who have not yet considered occupational hazards beyond those related to pressure. We strongly urge those doctors to work closer with the employers of divers and compressed air workers and to consider further formal study in occupational medicine. In many countries, diving medicine doctors involved with occupational divers must also have a formal occupational medicine qualification.",,,

However, there is an urgent need for predictive biomarkers to identify patients with metastatic melanoma who do not benefit from treatment with ICIs, to prevent unnecessary immune related adverse events (irAEs). Electronic noses (eNoses) showed promising results in the detection of cancer as well as the prediction of response outcome in patients with cancer. In this feasibility study, we aimed to investigate whether the breath pattern measured using eNose can be used as a simple biomarker to predict clinical benefit to first-line treatment with ICIs in patients with metastatic melanoma. In this prospective, observational single-center feasibility study, patients with metastatic melanoma performed a breath test using Aeonose™ before start of first-line treatment with ICIs. The detected exhaled breath pattern of volatile organic compounds (VOC) was used for machine learning in a training set to develop a model to identify patients who do not benefit from treatment with ICIs. Lack of clinical benefit was defined as progressive disease according to best tumor response using RECIST v1.1. Primary outcome measures were sensitivity, specificity and accuracy. The eNose showed a distinct breath pattern between patients with and without clinical benefit from ICIs. To identify patients who do not benefit from first-line ICIs treatment, breath pattern analysis using the eNose resulted in a sensitivity of 88%, specificity of 79%, and accuracy of 85%. Exhaled breath analysis using eNose can identify patients with metastatic melanoma who will not benefit from first-line treatment with ICIs and guide treatment strategies. When validated in an external cohort, eNose could be a useful tool to select these patients for alternative treatment strategies in clinical practice.",,,

We aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of RFA in treating hyperparathyroidism. PubMed and Embase were searched for original literature published on or before July 18, 2024. We included 14 eligible studies with 593 patients (241 with primary hyperparathyroidism [PHPT], 310 with secondary hyperparathyroidism [SHPT], and 42 with tertiary hyperparathyroidism [THPT]). Serial pooled means of biochemical indexes (parathyroid hormone [PTH], calcium, phosphorus), volume reduction ratio (VRR) after RFA, and complication rate were calculated. In PHPT, the pooled mean baseline PTH value of 158.7 pg/mL and serum calcium value of 10.96 mg/dL significantly decreased to 57.3 pg/mL and 9.55 mg/dL, respectively, at 12 months (both p < 0.001), with both being within normal ranges. The pooled mean VRR gradually increased, reaching 95.6% at 12 months. In SHPT, the pooled mean baseline PTH value of 1683.7 pg/mL significantly decreased to 267.2 pg/mL at 12 months (p < 0.001), which was within the target reference level (PTH ≤ 585 pg/mL). In THPT, the mean baseline PTH value of 1284.9 pg/mL decreased to 161.6 pg/mL at 1 year (p < 0.001). The pooled incidence rates of total, major, and minor complications were 27.9%, 7.5%, and 20.0%, respectively.

This study aimed to evaluate the feasibility, efficacy, and safety of utilizing the inferior vena cava-splenic vein shunt (IVCSS) as a new treatment option in cirrhotic patients with complete portal trunk occlusion and portal cavernoma. The IVCSS procedure was performed on twelve patients, involving the creation of a shunt using a covered stent between the inferior vena cava and the proximal end of the splenic vein to reduce distal portal pressure. Technical success was achieved in all patients, with a mean procedure duration of 71.7 ± 44.2 min. The portosystemic gradient was reduced by a mean of 11.0 ± 5.6 mmHg after the procedure. After a median follow-up of 6.7 [2.8-11.4] months, clinical symptoms improved in all patients. Stent dysfunction occurred in 1 patient, the recurrence rates for variceal bleeding and ascites were 8.3% and 16.7%, respectively. One patient (8.3%) experienced a procedure-related complication of retroperitoneal hemorrhage. Three patients (25%) had an episode of hepatic encephalopathy, which improved after conservative treatment. IVCSS effectively reduced distal portal pressure, which contributed to an improvement of the patients' clinical symptoms with an acceptable procedure-related complication rate. IVCSS may serve as an alternative strategy to manage symptomatic portal hypertension for patients with complete portal trunk occlusion and portal cavernoma. Question What is an alternative treatment for cirrhotic patients with symptomatic portal hypertension caused by chronic portal vein occlusion other than TIPS?

However, we still do not understand the extent to which it engages subcortical circuits that may contribute to the associated evoked potentials (EPs). Here we show that cortical stimulation generates remarkably similar EPs in humans and mice, with a late component similarly modulated by the state of the targeted cortico-thalamic network. We then optogenetically dissect the underlying circuit in mice, demonstrating that the EPs late component is caused by a thalamic hyperpolarization and rebound. The magnitude of this late component correlates with bursting frequency and synchronicity of thalamic neurons, modulated by the subject's behavioral state. A simulation of the thalamo-cortical circuit highlights that both intrinsic thalamic currents as well as cortical and thalamic GABAergic neurons contribute to this response profile. We conclude that single pulse cortical stimulation engages cortico-thalamo-cortical circuits largely preserved across different species and stimulation modalities.",Russo S; Furregoni G; Zauli FM; Hassan G; Solbiati M; d'Orio P; Sarasso S; Rosanova M; Sartori I; Pigorini A; Massimini M,ASST Grande Ospedale Metropolitano Niguarda; Department of Biomedical; Department of Biomedical and Clinical Sciences,irene.rembado@alleninstitute.org.

Although the introduction of innovative devices such as PRET has the potential to improve ophthalmological practice, their clinical practicability and tolerability is not always guaranteed. The aim of this study was therefore to assess the usability and tolerability of PRET. A 6-week, prospective study was conducted at our institution in 2024. We included both healthy subjects from our institution and patients from the neuro-ophthalmological clinic. Data on demographics, participants' perception, and evaluation of the assessment (measured using a visual analog scale [good, mediocre, poor]), the technician's impression of the device's technical performance, as well as the need for surveillance over the assessment, were obtained via a standardized questionnaire by the same technician. The study was approved by the ETH Zurich Ethics Commission (EK 2024-N-177) and informed consent was obtained. There were 43 participants included in the study, of whom 39 were healthy subjects from our institution and 4 patients from our neuro-ophthalmological practice. Of the total cohort, 20 were women and the median age was 37 years (range 20 - 84). Overall, 86% of participants rated the device as good. Approximately 70% of participants reported no issues with the assessment, 6.2% perceived the exam as strenuous, and only one felt dizzy (without nausea) during the assessment. From a technician's perspective, PRET performed very well in most cases, with technical difficulties occurring during testing in 16% of cases and either before or after testing in 4% of cases. Of the participants, 49% were left with transient goggle marks after the examination, which was considered an acceptable adverse effect. In this study, neuro-ophthalmological assessment with PRET demonstrated promising results in terms of clinical practicability and patient tolerance. However, in its current form, PRET is not self-explanatory and requires supervised care by a technician. Further studies are needed to corroborate our findings in a patient-based cohort. Ein neues Diagnosegerät namens PRET (neos) wurde kürzlich von der Firma machineMD als neuroophthalmologisches Untersuchungsinstrument eingeführt, das auf einer handelsüblichen Virtual-Reality-Brille basiert. Doch innovative Geräte, die die medizinische Praxis verbessern sollen, garantieren nicht automatisch klinische Praktikabilität und Patiententoleranz. Daher zielte diese Studie darauf ab, diese Frage zu klären, indem eine Untersuchung zur Benutzerfreundlichkeit von PRET durchgeführt wurde. Eine prospektive Studie wurde 2024 über einen Zeitraum von 6 Wochen an unserer Institution durchgeführt. Wir schlossen gesunde Probanden unserer Institution sowie Patienten aus unserer klinischen Sprechstunde ein. Daten zu Demografie, Teilnehmerwahrnehmung und Bewertung der Untersuchung, der Einschätzung der Untersuchungsperson zur technischen Leistung des Geräts sowie dem Bedarf an Überwachung während der Untersuchung wurden mithilfe eines standardisierten Fragebogens durch denselben Techniker erhoben. Die Studie wurde von der Ethikkommission der ETH Zürich genehmigt (EK 2024-N-177) und eine informierte Einwilligung wurde eingeholt. In diese Studie wurden 43 Teilnehmer eingeschlossen, von denen 39 gesunde Probanden von unserer Klinik und 4 Patienten aus unserer neuroophthalmologischen Sprechstunde stammten. Das mittlere Alter der gesamten Kohorte betrug 37 Jahre (Spanne 20 – 84) und 20 waren Frauen. Das Gerät wurde auf einer visuellen Analogskala (gut, mittelmäßig, schlecht) von 86% der Teilnehmer als gut bewertet. Etwa 70% der Teilnehmer hatten keine Probleme mit der Untersuchung, während 6,2% den Test als anstrengend empfanden. Nur ein Patient fühlte sich schwindelig, jedoch ohne Übelkeit. Aus Sicht des Technikers lief PRET die meiste Zeit reibungslos, technische Schwierigkeiten traten bei 16,3% der Tests und bei 4,1% entweder vor oder nach dem Test auf. 49% der Teilnehmer hatten nach der Untersuchung Abdrücke von der Brille, die wir als akzeptable Nebenwirkung betrachteten. In dieser Kohorte zeigte die neuroophthalmologische Untersuchung mit PRET vielversprechende Ergebnisse in Bezug auf die klinische Praktikabilität und die Toleranz der Teilnehmer. Allerdings ist PRET in seinem aktuellen Zustand nicht selbsterklärend und erfordert die Betreuung durch einen Techniker.

In this context, coughing quantification is often important, but routinely performed via questionnaires. This approach is dependent on patient compliance or recall, which may affect validity and be especially difficult for nocturnal coughs. Manual review of audio recordings is potentially more accurate, but raises privacy concerns due to the collection and review of sensitive audio-data by a human annotator. Today, machine learning approaches are increasingly used to quantify coughs; however, algorithms often rely on microphone recordings, resulting in the same privacy issues, especially if data are sent to a remote server for analysis. The aims of this study are to determine if (1) a suite of sensors, excluding microphone recordings, can accurately detect coughs unobtrusively and (2) what the relative importance of each sensor-type on model performance may be. Data from 44 healthy young adult participants performing on-demand coughs and other tasks (breathing, talking, throat clearing, laughing, sniffing) in supine and sitting conditions were collected for this observational, cross-sectional study using a multi-sensor smart-garment device. Synchronized video was used to annotate tasks. Three-dimension acceleration, respiration (inductance plethysmography), and electrical activity (electrocardiography) signals were extracted into 1 s strips and binarized into coughs and non-coughs. Data were split into train and test sets using an inter-subject 80:20 split, ensuring that data from a particular participant are found in a single set. This procedure was repeated 10 times with different random inter-subject splits to assess the variability of results. Statistical and frequency-based features were computed and used as inputs to a Random Forest Classifier to predict classes (cough vs not-cough). Model hyperparameters were tuned to maximize F1-score using five-fold cross validation of the training set. Final model performance was assessed using F1-score, precision, and recall (sensitivity) on the test sets with mean (standard deviation) reported. Single sensor models based on acceleration, respiration, or electrocardiography revealed F1 scores of 92.6 (1.2)%, 88.9 (3.2)%, and 77.5 (3.4)%, respectively. Overall, the dual (acceleration, respiration) sensor model achieved the highest performance (F1-score 93.0 (1.1)%, precision 84.2 (4.2)%, and recall 95.5 (1.6)%). The multi-modal wearable device was able to distinguish coughs from other respiratory maneuvers, with acceleration and respiration sensors providing the most valuable information.

These relationships can potentially influence research, education, and patient care. The purpose of this study was to evaluate inconsistencies between physician disclosures and the Open Payments database for a national spine conference. Disclosures of participants in the 2023 North American Spine Society (NASS) conferences were compared with the Open Payments database. Discrepancies were noted whenever a participant had a company listing on their Open Payments page that was not reported in their disclosure in the NASS Disclosure Index. Simple statistics were reported as a frequency and percentage for categorical variables, and median and interquartile range (IQR) were used for continuous variables. Pearson correlations were run to investigate associations between the number of reportable companies, the number of discrepancies, and general payment amounts. A total of 432 participants met the inclusion criteria, with the majority having discrepancies between their self-reported disclosures and the Open Payments database (84.2%, N=364/432). Regarding surgeons with a discrepancy, 80.2% (N=292/364) failed to report payments of less than 1,000 USD. Physicians affiliated with a larger number of reportable companies were associated with an increased number of discrepancies (p<.001,  Discrepancy rates between what surgeons disclosed at NASS 2023 and what companies reported to Open Payments were high. However, the majority of these discrepancies that the physicians failed to report were low in value, falling below 1,000 USD. As a potential means to mitigate these discrepancies, it is imperative that physicians review their Open Payments page prior to disclosure submission.",,,

Fifteen healthy participants underwent NMES stimulation through 3 × 3 cm TTE with ten combinations of frequency (1-36 Hz) and plateau times (0.5-7 s). NMES was increased until plantar flexion occurred, at which point ultrasound-measurements were made of popliteal peak venous velocity (PVV), time-averaged mean velocity (TAMV), average duration of blood flow pulse (ADBP) and ejection volume (EV). Discomfort (NRS, 0-10), current amplitude, and energy consumption were recorded. Median values were analyzed with significance set at p < 0.05.

Compared to 36 Hz, 1 Hz showed significantly lower discomfort (NRS: 0.4 vs. 1.6) and energy consumption (0.4 vs. 31.3 mJ, both p ≤ 0.01) but required higher current amplitude (33.2 vs. 23.3 mA, p < 0.01) to reach plantar flexion. The study concludes that both 1 Hz and 36 Hz frequency improve venous hemodynamics, but 1 Hz stimulation minimizes discomfort and energy use while maintaining effectiveness.Trial registration: Retrospectively registered with Clinical Trials, trial ID: NCT06082297.",,,robin.juthberg@ki.se.
40234380,Dose-response relationship between evening exercise and sleep.,2025-04-15,Nature communications,10.1038/s41467-025-58271-x,"Public health guidelines recommend exercise as a key lifestyle intervention for promoting and maintaining healthy sleep function and reducing disease risk. However, strenuous evening exercise may disrupt sleep due to heightened sympathetic arousal. This study examines the association between strenuous evening exercise and objective sleep, using data from 14,689 physically active individuals who wore a biometric device during a one-year study interval (4,084,354 person-nights). Here we show later exercise timing and higher exercise strain are associated with delayed sleep onset, shorter sleep duration, lower sleep quality, higher nocturnal resting heart rate, and lower nocturnal heart rate variability. Regardless of strain, exercise bouts ending ≥4 hours before sleep onset are not associated with changes in sleep. Our results suggest evening exercise-particularly involving high exercise strain-may disrupt subsequent sleep and nocturnal autonomic function. Individuals aiming to improve sleep health may benefit from concluding exercise at least 4 hours before sleep onset or electing lighter strain exercises within this window.",Presby DM; Capodilupo ER,Department of Data Science and Research,josh.leota@monash.edu.
40231859,A path forward advancing microphysiological systems.,2025-04-15,ALTEX,10.14573/altex.2504091,"Microphysiological systems (MPS), including organ-on-chip platforms and complex organoid models, represent a transformative approach to human-relevant in vitro modeling. These technol-ogies bioengineer aspects of organ architecture and functionality, revolutionizing drug development, reducing animal testing, and enabling personalized medicine approaches. Despite significant advances, several critical challenges remain before their full potential can be realized. This article examines key obstacles facing MPS adoption and implementation while proposing actionable solu-tions to accelerate their development and acceptance. Major challenges include standardization issues across terminology and protocols, validation complexities requiring robust reference com-pounds and benchmarking standards, regulatory uncertainties regarding data requirements and qualification processes, and barriers to effective data sharing among stakeholders. The paper traces the field's evolution through various international initiatives, particularly highlighting the Center for Alternatives to Animal Testing's (CAAT) contributions, including the establishment of the International MPS Society and World Summits. Proposed solutions emphasize establishing global standards through international consortia, enhancing validation frameworks through specialized validation centers, fostering collaboration through pre-competitive consortia and standardized data formats, and advancing regulatory integration through detailed case studies and clear guidance documents. Future priorities focus on overcoming technical challenges in biological complexity, addressing engineering hurdles, standardizing technologies, improving data management, increasing eco-nomic accessibility, and integrating with other emerging technologies. The path forward requires coordinated, collaborative efforts across academia, industry, regulatory agencies, and technology suppliers to systematically address these interrelated challenges. Microphysiological systems (MPS) are advanced laboratory models that mimic human organs using engineered tissues and microfluidic technology. These “organs-on-chips” and 3D orga­noids allow scientists to study disease and test drugs without using animals. Despite their promise, MPS face several challenges that slow their widespread adoption. These include inconsistent standards, difficulties proving they work reliably, regulatory uncertainties, and limited data sharing between organizations. This paper identifies these obstacles and proposes practical solu­tions: creating international standards, establishing dedicated centers to validate MPS models, encouraging organizations to share data, and developing clear regulatory pathways. The authors highlight ongoing collaborative efforts, including international conferences and societies dedicated to advancing MPS technologies. With coordinated effort from scientists, companies, and regulators, MPS could transform drug development, reduce animal testing, and enable more personalized treatment approaches, ultimately improving human health while reducing research costs.",,,

Soft contact lens (CL) designs have been developed to slow myopia and potentially reduce long-term risk, but there is still a need for additional designs of varied materials and parameters to cater for diverse patient needs. The MultifocAL COntact Lenses for Myopia control study aims to compare the efficacy of the Acuvue Oasys for Presbyopia (AOP) CL against the Food and Drug Administration approved MiSight 1-Day multifocal CL in controlling progressive myopia in children using a non-inferiority contralateral eye design. A double-blind, contralateral eye, non-inferiority, randomised, controlled clinical trial will be conducted at University of New South Wales Sydney, Australia (UNSW). Children (6 to 12 years of age, inclusive) will be randomised to wear AOP in their right or left eye, with the MiSight 1-Day CL fitted to the contralateral eye. The primary outcome is the difference in axial length and cycloplegic objective refraction change between the two CLs over 12 months. Additional outcomes include quality of life, pupillometry and adherence to treatment. To achieve a statistical power of 80% to demonstrate non-inferiority of the AOP to the MiSight 1-Day and taking into consideration a 20% discontinuation rate, the calculated sample size is 72.

However, traditional multiplexed bio-analysis could not meet the demand for multiplexed detection due to the limitations of labeling dyes and microscope channels. Here, a novel fluorescence encoding strategy was proposed by using multi-color quantum dots (QDs) acted as fluorescence tags and micron sized superparamagnetic particle acted as encoding carrier. By adjusting the color and number of labeled QDs, fluorescence encoded superparamagnetic particles (FESPs) with distinct fluorescence colors and intensities were constructed. The FESPs were prepared by metal coordination-based layer-by-layer assembly with excellent binding effect. By binding DNA capture oligonucleotides, FESP probes were constructed for multiplexed detection of miRNA-21, miRNA-122 and miRNA-130b with excellent specificity. Moreover, the miRNA targets could be easily separated within 5 s originated from the excellent superparamagnetism, enabling great simplified bio-analysis process.

Although the overall side effect profile is low, the rate of de novo gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) ranges between 2.1 and 49%. Our study compares postoperative outcomes using a single-fire stapler versus a multiple-fire linear stapler, with a focus on postoperative de novo GERD. This was a retrospective single-surgeon study with data from 257 patients who underwent consecutive robotic-assisted sleeve gastrectomy between 2016 and 2023 with either multiple fires of a linear stapler (n = 201) or a single-fire linear stapler (n = 56). Patient demographics and postoperative outcomes, including 30-day complications, 1-year weight loss, and 1-year postoperative reflux, were analyzed. Patients in the single-fire group were noted to have a significantly lower rate of postoperative reflux (7.1% vs. 26.4%) and a decreased incidence of de novo reflux (1.8% vs. 10.9%). Additionally, the single-fire group had a shorter average length of stay (2.0 days vs. 2.2 days, p = 0.04). Multivariable analysis demonstrated that single-fire stapler use increased the likelihood of not developing postoperative GERD (odds ratio: 8.4, 95% confidence interval: 2.8-32.5). There was no significant difference in operative time (multiple-fire group: 81.4 min, single-fire group: 90.1 min, p = 0.5) or 1-year percent total weight loss (multiple-fire: 22.4% ± 0.7%, single-fire: 22.0% ± 1.7%, p = 0.8). Single-fire stapler use may enhance postoperative outcomes in LSG by reducing rates of de novo GERD without impacting weight loss. There was no significant difference in operative time, and postoperative length of stay may be decreased.",Rutledge R; Ringold F,Mobile Infirmary,lee.ying@yale.edu.

Ultrasound transducers based on this technology offer a wider frequency bandwidth, improved cost-effectiveness, miniaturized size and effective integration with electronics. These features have led to an increase in the commercialization of CMUTs in the last 10 years. We conducted a review to answer three main research questions: (1) What are the commercially available CMUT-based clinical sonographic devices in the medical imaging space? (2) What are the medical imaging applications of these devices? (3) What is the performance of the devices in these applications?

40218655,"On-the-Fly Sleep Scoring Algorithm with Heart Rate, RR Intervals and Accelerometer as Input.",2025-04-12,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",10.3390/s25072141,"In many applications, recognizing the depth of sleep (e.g., light, deep, REM sleep) while the subject is sleeping enables innovative features. For instance, in SAE Level 4 autonomous driving, a driver may need to takeover the vehicle control in case the autopilot is exiting its operational design domain. Depending on the depth of the sleep, the subject may need time to takeover effectively; hence, it is particularly relevant to know in which sleep stage the subject is (e.g., light sleep, deep sleep, and REM sleep), and possibly initiate actions to prevent the subject to remain in those sleep stages that lead to longer takeover time. Sleep stage classification can be achieved through an on-the-fly algorithm, which generates output in response to each input portion without knowledge of future inputs, unlike an off-Line algorithm that provides output just after receiving the entire input sequence. Various studies have analyzed algorithms or devices that identify sleep stages during the night; however, these typically require electroencephalography (EEG), which is obtrusive, or specialized devices. This study describes the development of an on-the-fly sleep-scoring algorithm using Heart Rate (HR), RR intervals, which is the distance between two consecutive heartbeats, and accelerometer data from a smartwatch, widespread, non-invasive, and affordable but accurate device. The subjects involved in our study wore a commercial off-the-shelf wearable device during a full night's sleep, and were also monitored using a reference medical device to establish the ground truth by means of a full polysomnography (PSG) analysis. The on-the-fly sleep scoring algorithm based on smartwatch data was tested against PSG-based scoring, achieving 88.46% accuracy, 91.42% precision, and 93.52% sensitivity in sleep-wake identification.

A prime example is manhole cover removal, which typically requires handling heavy weights, potentially leading to lower back muscle strain. This study investigates the effectiveness of a passive exoskeleton in reducing ergonomic risks during manhole cover removal. Twenty able-bodied workers participated, performing the task with and without extractor tools in the field. Techniques such as surface electromyography and inertial measurement units were employed to measure muscle activity and body posture using the Rapid Entire Body Assessment (REBA). This study compared muscle activities and REBA scores under different conditions: manually lifting covers, using an in-house lever tool, and using a sledgehammer and a pick bar tool named Jake, both with and without an exoskeleton. Results revealed that the in-house Lever tool was the safest and most efficient method, resulting in the lowest muscle activities and REBA scores, regardless of exoskeleton use. Interestingly, the exoskeleton significantly reduced muscle strain when using the Jake tool. These findings indicate that while the Lever tool is optimal for this task, passive exoskeletons can effectively lower ergonomic risks associated with more physically demanding tools.",Krell S,EPCOR,

In response, public policies were enacted to mitigate this effect. However, there is limited evidence examining surgical device industry payments and surgeons' utilization of robot-assisted surgeries (RAS). This study assessed the relationship between industry payments to healthcare providers and the usage of RAS. Using 2015-2020 data from the CMS ""Sunshine"" Open Payments Database and New York State's (NYS) Statewide hospital discharge databases, we assessed temporal and spatial relationships between industry payments to hospitals and surgeons and volumes of RAS. During 2015-2020, general surgery robotic device manufacturers paid providers more than $236 M nationwide. The highest proportion of payments was made toward ""Education and training"" (66.6%) and ""Food and travel"" (20.6%). In NYS, gastrointestinal (GI) RAS volume steadily increased by 182% (2015-2019, p < 0.01), while there was a 150% increase in general surgeon payments. Genitourinary (GU) and gynecological (GYN) surgeon payments remained unchanged but GU and GYN RAS volume increased by 17% and 75%, respectively, during this period (p < 0.05). Approximately, 93% of payments and 98% of abdomen and pelvic RAS in NYS were concentrated in metropolitan or non-rural counties. With increasing payments from robotic device companies toward surgeon education and training, the use of RAS is likely to continue to rise in the long term.

Respiratory medicine,10.1016/S2213-2600(25)00037-2,"Clinical risk factors for severe asthma attacks have been identified, but their incremental prognostic values are unclear. Additionally, the incremental contribution of type 2 inflammation, a common, treatable process, is undetermined. We aimed to quantify the prognostic value of baseline characteristics and type 2 inflammatory biomarkers, specifically blood eosinophil count and fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO), to predict asthma attacks. In this systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials (RCTs), Oxford Asthma Attack Risk Scale 2 (ORACLE2), we searched MEDLINE from Jan 1, 1993, to April 1, 2021, for trials investigating fixed treatment regimen effects on asthma attack rates for at least 6 months with baseline blood eosinophil count and FeNO. Eligible participants were aged 12 years or older with asthma (any severity) who had been randomly assigned to the control group of an RCT. Relevant trials were manually retrieved and reviewed by two independent reviewers (SC and IDP). Disagreements were discussed with five reviewers. Individual patient data (IPD) for meta-analysis were requested from study authors. We investigated the rate of severe asthma attacks (≥3 days of systemic corticosteroids) for at least 6 months and prognostic effects of baseline blood eosinophil count and FeNO in control group participants. Rate ratios (RRs) with 95% CIs were derived for annualised asthma attack rates from negative binomial models adjusted for key variables, including blood eosinophil count and FeNO, and interactions between these type 2 inflammatory biomarkers were explored. Certainty of evidence was assessed using GRADE. The heterogeneity of the included studies and potential for ecological bias were quantified by the concordance statistic (C-statistic). This study was registered with PROSPERO, CRD42021245337. We identified 976 potentially eligible studies. After automated screening, we manually reviewed 219 full-text articles. Of these, 19 publications comprising 23 RCTs were eligible. 6513 participants (4140 [64%] female; 2370 [36%] male; three missing) spanning 22 RCTs were included for data analysis. 5972 (92%) of 6513 patients had moderate-to-severe asthma. 4615 asthma attacks occurred during 5482 person-years of follow-up (annualised rate 0·84 per person-year). Higher blood eosinophil count or FeNO was linked to higher asthma attack risk (per 10-fold increase, RR 1·48 [95% CI 1·30-1·68] for blood eosinophil count and 1·44 [1·26-1·65] for FeNO; high-certainty evidence).

Here, we show the combination of silk fibroin and elastin-like recombinamers in a dip-coating multilayer setup to achieve smooth small-diameter vascular grafts with ultrathin wall thickness. We found in both FTIR and mechanical characterization that the novel material combination was successful through the double crosslinked interpenetrated network formed by elastin-like recombinamers and silk fibroin. This enabled the graft to have mechanical compliance that followed physiological behaviour, differently from the synthetic materials traditionally used in clinics. The mechanical behaviour of these grafts also achieved burst pressure (745.44 ± 102.92 mmHg) and suture retention strength (0.86 ± 0.13 N) required for clinical application. The structure proved to have low platelet adhesion in the thrombogenicity assessment (3.79 ± 3.26 % of platelet area coverage), which is essential for successful outcomes in physiological conditions.

Physical therapy (PT) effectively complements pharmacological treatment to improve postural stability, gait performance, and other dopamine-resistant symptoms (e.g. freezing of gait) in the general population with PD. Despite the positive potential of combined PT and STN-DBS surgery, scientific results are still lacking. We therefore involved worldwide leading experts on DBS and motor rehabilitation in PwPD in a consensus Delphi panel to define the current level of PT recommendation following STN-DBS surgery. After summarizing the few available findings through a systematic scoping review, we identified clinically and academically experienced DBS clinicians (n = 21) to discuss the challenges related to PT following STN-DBS. A 5-point Likert scale questionnaire was used and based on the results of the systematic review, thirty-nine questions were designed and submitted to the panel-half related to general considerations on PT following STN-DBS, and half related to PT treatments. Despite the low-to-moderate quality of data, the few available rehabilitation studies suggested that PT could improve dynamic and static balance, gait performance and posture in the population with PD receiving STN-DBS. Similarly, the panellists strongly agreed that PT might help improve motor symptoms and quality of life, and it may be prescribed to maximize the effects of stimulation. The experts agreed that physical therapists could be part of the multidisciplinary team taking care of the patients. Also, they agreed that conventional PT, but not massage or manual therapy, should be prescribed because of the specificity of STN-DBS implantation. Although RCT evidence is lacking, upon Delphi panel, PT for PwPD receiving STN-DBS can be potentially useful to maximize clinical improvement. However, more research is needed, with RCTs and well-designed studies. The rehabilitation and DBS community should expand this area of research to create guidelines for PT following STN-DBS.",Hamani C; Modugno N; Santilli M,Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre; IRCCS INM Neuromed,sara.marceglia@unimi.it.

An mandible model in beagle dogs was introduced. 144 mini-implants were implanted in both sides of the mandibles. The mini-implants in the experimental group (left side) were loaded at the magnitude of 200 g to simulate the OF. At 2, 4 and 6 months after implantation, tissue specimens were taken from the implanted sites and biomechanical, histological and histomorphometrical analysis were performed. Mini-implants in the group with the highest PLLA ratio showed a 27% non-fracture rate after 4 months and 20.83% after 6 months in beagle dogs, and the non-fractured mini-implants could maintain the tensile force of 200 g, while mini-implants in the other two groups were all fractured. Histomorphological analysis showed that there was no significant relationship between Bone Volume over Total Volume (BV/TV) and the implantation time among the most of the groups. The level of Bone-Implant Contact ratio (BIC) in Medium and Low ratio group were decreased gradually from 2 to 6 months.

Furthermore, the severity of the histological data was stratified, and its relationship with the clinical findings was investigated. This retrospective single-centre cohort study included 20 patients with FM treated with MCS between 2013 and 2023. The primary outcome was successful weaning from MCS (MCS decannulation and survival to discharge). Two validations were conducted: Validation A, to evaluate the predictive value of peak CK-MB and LVPWD, and validation B, to evaluate the performance of the prediction model for successful MCS weaning derived from the CHANGE PUMP Study. The histological findings of 21 specimens were used for additional analyses. The pathological severity of myocardial inflammation, necrosis and oedema was stratified, and their relationship with clinical data was assessed. 14 patients were successfully weaned from MCS. In validation A, the weaning success rate was significantly higher in patients with peak CK-MB≤185 IU/L than in those with peak CK-MB>185 IU/L. Similar findings were observed in patients with LVPWD≤11 mm compared with those with LVPWD>11 mm. In Validation B, the median predictive MCS weaning success rate for the entire cohort was 80%. Compared with patients who underwent MCS decannulation successfully, those who did not had a significantly lower predictive success rate. The C-statistic of the model was 0.845. The histological severity at admission was not associated with the primary outcome. However, the CK-MB levels and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) obtained simultaneously were correlated with histological severity. Previously reported predictors of successful weaning from MCS in FM demonstrated reasonable discrimination.

40201707,Importance to understand medical device regulations for accelerating clinical translation.,,Journal of orthopaedic translation,10.1016/j.jot.2025.02.002,"Clinical translation of medical devices is determined by many factors and is challenging for certain countries or regions as no regulatory body is available to approve related applications. They must rely on application for regulatory bodies of other countries or regions who have independent medical device regulatory systems, while the major markets regulatory process is different. For example, considering the market size and policy orientation, mainland China may be a good option for Hong Kong research organizations. Typically, China National Medical Products Administration (NMPA) has positioned innovation as a key growth engine and implemented various mechanisms to expedite the registration, including Marketing Authorization Holder policy (MAH), as well as the setting up of the NMPA's Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA) Branch Office, type test reform and application for securing innovation channel application. However, there are still many challenges in the transitional process for Hong Kong universities or research institutions, to set up a company in mainland and then prepare many documental files from very beginning. In the future, taking advantage of NMPA reform and seeking cooperation with the NMPA to establish an independent regulatory body in Hong Kong to be recognized by NMPA is recommended as this alone will boost innovation in life sciences and boost in Hong Kong, and have a positive impact on the commercialization of medical devices in mainland China. Such example may also be relevant for many countries or regions who are seeking medical device approval in the designated regulatory systems.",,,

A retrospective analysis from two Academic Level I Trauma Centers of all operatively treated LC2 and LC3 (AO/OTA 61-B2/B3) pelvic ring injuries from January 2019-January 2024. A comparison of anterior ring constructs was made: no fixation vs. fixation; indirect fixation (external fixators and InFix)) vs. internal fixation; long vs. short percutaneous screws. Long percutaneous screws were defined as either bicortical bypassing all 3 Nakatani zones or bypassing the fracture by 2 Nakatani zones with intramedullary juxtacortical or bicortical finishing. A short screw was defined as all other screws, regardless of direction. Primary outcome measure was >1 cm of pelvic ring displacement from post-operative to final radiographs showing fracture healing with sufficient callus. Secondary outcomes were unplanned major reoperation, removal of implants or non-union repair, and other surgical complications. 67 patients met inclusion criteria. Most were female (n = 35, 52 %), mean age was 48.3 (SD 21.7) and most injuries were LC3 (n = 39, 58 %). All cases had posterior ring fixation.

This study focuses on enhancing diffusion by creating a microporous microenvironment using gelatin microparticles within collagen scaffolds. By leveraging the FRESH (Freeform Reversible Embedding of Suspended Hydrogels) 3D bioprinting technique, gelatin microparticles are utilized both as a support material and as a thermoresponsive porogen to establish interconnected pores. The results indicate that scaffolds with 75% porosity significantly increase diffusion rates and cell viability, extending beyond the conventional ∼200 μm limit. Additionally, integrating vascular-like channels with porous scaffolds and applying perfusion improved nutrient transport, leading to enhanced cell survival in larger constructs. This combination of microporosity and perfusion represents a promising approach to create thicker tissues without necrotic regions, potentially paving the way for scalable tissue engineering applications. The findings suggest that optimizing pore sizes and scaffold perfusion can bridge the gap between rapid tissue formation and slower vascularization processes, enabling the future development of functional tissue constructs at clinically relevant scales.",,,

The present study aims to describe experiences with Mpox-related sexual behaviors, stigma, and vaccine barriers and facilitators among a sample of BLSMM living in both California and New York. In this qualitative interpretive phenomenological study, we utilized semi-structured individual interviews as the primary source for data collection. Data was collected between August 2021 and December 2022 from 41 adult participants in California and New York. Interviews were recorded, transcribed verbatim, and analyzed using thematic content analysis. Participants ranged in age from 19 to 65 years, with the majority identifying as Black (73%) and male gender (93%). Overall, participants' narratives revealed that initial messaging around Mpox produced stigma parallel to the HIV/AIDS pandemic with many participants curtailing their sexual behaviors as a harm reduction strategy. Mpox-related stigma negatively impacted sexual minority communities both internally and externally. Participants' narratives also revealed general vaccine skepticism due to existing medical distrust, negative vaccine experiences by other BLSMM, and lack of prioritization of outreach and distribution efforts in communities of color. Alterations to vaccine administration protocols and outreach efforts for reasons identified in this study are critical to addressing disparities in vaccine uptake among BLSMM.

These categories are defined by their pathological origin, clinical relevance, and therapeutic implications. A lesion localisation model was first developed using manually annotated PET/CT images. For classification, a multi-dimensional joint network was employed, incorporating both image patches and two-dimensional projections. Classification performance was quantified by metrics like accuracy, and compared to that of a radiomics model. Additionally, false-positive segmentations were manually reviewed and analysed for clinical evaluation. The study retrospectively included 647 cases (409 males/238 females) over more than 8 years from five centres, divided into an internal dataset (426 cases from Shanghai Ruijin Hospital), an external test set I (151 cases from four other institutions), and an external test set II (70 cases from a new imaging device). The localisation model achieved detection rates of 81.19%, 75.48%, and 77.59% on the internal, external test set I, and external test set II, respectively. The classification model outperformed the radiomics approach, with area-under-curves of 88.4%, 80.7%, and 66.6%, respectively. Most false-positive segmentations were clinically acceptable, corresponding to suspicious lesions in adjacent regions, particularly lymph nodes.

Home blood pressure measurement (HBPM) is recommended for blood pressure (BP) management. HBPM is most effective to improve BP management when delivered with patient education. It is unknown whether web-based resources are appropriate for patient education for HBPM. Patient education should provide accurate, evidence-based information, communicate at an eighth grade reading level, and involve end users in development to meet the needs of adults of all health literacy levels. Using these criteria, this study aimed to determine the appropriateness of web-based HBPM resources. This study aimed to determine whether web-based resources are appropriate for HBPM education based on three research questions: (1) Do web-based resources provide evidence-based information that aligns with guideline recommendations? (2) Do they communicate at an appropriate reading level? (3) Do they involve end users in their development? An environmental scan of web-based resources for HBPM was conducted on Google (October 2022) using search terms developed with consumers (n=6). Resources were included if they were identified on the first page of the search findings, not paywalled, and in English. Resource appropriateness was appraised based on three criteria: (1) alignment of resource content to 23 recommendations for HBPM from 6 international guidelines, (2) being at an appropriate grade reading level as determined by a health literacy assessment software, and (3) having evidence of end user involvement in resource development. None of the identified resources (n=24) aligned with all 23 of the guideline recommendations. All resources aligned with the recommendation to measure BP when seated, while few aligned with the recommendation to use a validated BP device (n=9, 38%). All resources exceeded the recommended eighth grade reading level (mean 11.8, range 8.8-17.0) and none reported evidence of patient end user involvement in development.

Photosynthetic bacteria, capable of oxidizing reduced sulfides, can alleviate sulfide toxicity to microorganisms, thereby enhancing sulfate removal. This study compared the performance of anaerobic reactors under identical organic loads but with varying light conditions and different carbon-to-sulfur (C/S) ratios. The illuminated reactors outperformed the non-illuminated ones, achieving sulfate removal rates exceeding 85% when the light wavelength was optimized. Sludge analysis revealed that the illuminated group had larger particle sizes and higher protein and polysaccharide contents compared to the non-illuminated group. These findings suggest that light exposure enhances the removal of sulfate and organic matter, mitigates competitive inhibition, and promotes synergistic interactions among microbial populations, offering valuable insights for treating sulfate-rich wastewater using photosynthetic bacteria.",Xu Z,CCCC Second Harbor Engineering Company Ltd.,yeyuanyao16@hust.edu.cn.
40172631,[Point of care coagulation diagnostics-Absolutely necessary or only a reasonable supplement?].,2025-05-16,Die Anaesthesiologie,10.1007/s00101-025-01524-7,"Point of care (POC) coagulation diagnostics have become an integral part of clinical patient care. In particular, the strengths of POC viscoelastometry (VET) lie not only in the rapid availability of test results but also in the fact that VET provides insights into coagulation that cannot be detected by standard laboratory tests. The relevance of POC-VET in the optimal management of patients with acutely acquired bleeding disorders, such as trauma-induced coagulopathy, is now unquestioned and is also reflected in the corresponding guidelines; however, VET also provides important information about fibrinolysis and fibrinolytic activity and in combination with other laboratory values can possibly also be sensitive for prothrombotic coagulation disorders. Therefore, POC-VET is increasingly being used in intensive care medicine. The use of POC diagnostics is not subject to the same standards as central laboratory testing. In order to maintain high quality and avoid harming patients, the requirements for medical device manufacturers in particular have been increased as part of the in vitro diagnostic reagents (IVDR) regulations, which places high demands on quality management in particular. The variety of POC devices and the lack of comparability between them remains an unsolved problem. It should be critically discussed to what extent medical device manufacturers and pharmaceutical companies could be legally required to keep unique and urgently needed technologies on the market, especially if no comparable alternatives will be available in the foreseeable future. Overall, from today's perspective, the use of POC coagulation diagnostics is essential for optimal patient care. Die Point-of-care(POC)-Gerinnungsdiagnostik ist ein elementarer Bestandteil in der klinischen Versorgung von Patient*innen geworden. Die Stärken insbesondere der Point-of-care-Viskoelastometrie (POC-VET) liegen nicht nur in der schnellen Verfügbarkeit von Resultaten, sondern insbesondere auch darin, dass die VET Einblicke in die Gerinnung, welche mit Standardlaborverfahren nicht detektierbar sind, ermöglicht. Die Relevanz der POC-VET für die optimale Versorgung von Patient*innen mit akut erworbenen hämorrhagischen Gerinnungsstörungen, etwa im Rahmen der traumainduzierten Koagulopathie ist mittlerweile unumstritten und findet ihren Einzug auch in entsprechende Guidelines. Darüber hinaus kann die VET allerdings auch wichtige Hinweise liefern über die Fibrinolyse bzw. fibrinolytische Aktivität und in der Zusammenschau mit anderen Werten möglicherweise auch Ausschluss geben über prothrombotische Gerinnungsstörungen. Daher findet die POC-VET vermehrt Anwendung auch in der Intensivmedizin. Um der breiten Anwendung gerecht zu werden, wurden insbesondere die Anforderungen an die Medizinproduktehersteller im Rahmen der IVDR verschärft, was hohe Anforderungen an ein Qualitätsmanagement stellt. Weiterhin kritisch anzusehen, bleiben die Vielfalt an POC-Geräten und die fehlende Vergleichbarkeit untereinander. Daher muss diskutiert werden, inwieweit Medizinproduktehersteller und Pharmaunternehmen gesetzlich verpflichtet werden sollten – bzw. wie gesetzliche Reglungen durchzusetzen sind –, um einzigartige relevante Technologien auf dem Markt zu behalten. Dies gilt v. a. dann, wenn in absehbarer Zeit keine sinnvollen Alternativen zur Verfügung stehen werden.

MCED tests can detect cancer signals from multiple cancers concurrently in biological samples such as blood, urine, saliva, or other bodily fluids. Some tests can suggest the most likely cancer origin, whereas others report cancer detected somewhere in the body. Although some MCED tests are currently commercially available, none are approved by the Food and Drug Administration or endorsed by any clinical practice guideline or recommendation. Most insurance companies do not currently cover MCED testing. MCED tests have not yet been evaluated for safety and effectiveness in randomized controlled trials. Because patients already are asking for MCED test prescriptions or for interpretation of results from tests acquired elsewhere, clinicians should be prepared to discuss what is known about the benefits, risks, and uncertainties of MCED testing, including performance characteristics in screening populations and preferred follow-up strategies for positive test results. At this time, clinicians should not feel obligated to initiate discussions about MCED testing with their patients. However, clinicians should engage patients who inquire about getting tested or previous MCED test results in shared decision-making, and take the opportunity to offer and help patients complete age- and sex-appropriate guideline-recommended cancer screenings. In this article, the current evidence and issues around MCED testing are summarized, and a framework for shared decision-making discussions is provided.",,,

The recovery process has considerably varied across the affected municipalities, highlighting the need for effective and targeted risk communication to support residents in understanding these situations and making informed decisions. This study aims to examine the health risk communication strategies implemented by health and medical welfare experts in response to the lifting of evacuation orders in formerly evacuated areas. We provide an overview of the practical activities carried out by these experts, with a particular focus on the contributions of Fukushima Medical University, Hirosaki University, and Nagasaki University. Over the years, these institutions have played a key role in radiation protection and public health initiatives, guided by scientific and technical perspectives. Our findings underscore the necessity of evolving two-way communication practices that are responsive to specific needs of the recovery phase. Additionally, this study highlights the importance of integrating comprehensive health promotion activities with radiation health risk communication to ensure sustained attention to both physical and mental health. Furthermore, expert communication efforts remain essential in supporting social care professionals who are involved in the ongoing care of residents. Finally, the global sharing of Fukushima's recovery strategies is essential for providing insights that can inform future disaster preparedness efforts.",,,takamura@nagasaki-u.ac.jp.

This study investigates the impact of environmental factors on aqueous aerosol behaviour using a Respimat® Soft Mist Inhaler (SMI) formulated with and without ethanol content. Comparative Hygroscopic Aerosol Particle Sizing (CHAPS) was used to measure aerosol size distribution under varying RH levels, while single droplet analysis was conducted using Comparative Kinetics-Electrodynamic Balance (CK-EDB) to assess particle behaviour. The findings reveal that increased RH results in larger particle sizes, while elevated ethanol content consistently decreases both particle size and mass. The strong agreement between CHAPS measurements and CK-EDB data suggests that aerosol plume behaviour can be accurately modelled from single droplet data. The study highlights ethanol's role in optimizing particle size distribution, which is crucial for enhancing the therapeutic efficiency of inhaled medications. These results underscore the importance of tailoring formulation and environmental conditions to improve drug delivery outcomes in pulmonary therapies and the importance of recognising that aerosol particle size distributions are dynamic and highly compositionally dependent.",Ruiz JR; Friend R,Chiesi Ltd.,j.p.reid@bristol.ac.uk.

To assess patient- and community-level characteristics associated with RSV vaccine receipt and patient knowledge and attitudes related to RSV disease and RSV vaccines. During the first season of RSV vaccine use from October 1, 2023, to April 30, 2024, adults 60 years or older hospitalized with RSV-negative acute respiratory illness were enrolled in this cross-sectional study from 26 hospitals in 20 US states. Sociodemographic and clinical data were abstracted from health records, and structured interviews were conducted for knowledge and attitudes about RSV disease and RSV vaccines. Age, sex, race and ethnicity, pulmonary disease, immunocompromised status, long-term care facility residence, medical insurance, social vulnerability index (SVI), and educational level. The exposures were identified a priori as possible factors associated with RSV vaccine receipt and were entered into a modified Poisson regression model accounting for state clustering, to assess for association with RSV vaccine receipt. Knowledge and attitudes were summarized with frequencies and proportions. Among 6746 hospitalized adults 60 years or older, median age was 73 (IQR, 66-80) years and 3451 (51.2%) were female. Among the 6599 patients with self-reported race and ethnicity, 699 (10.6%) were Hispanic, 1288 (19.5%) were non-Hispanic Black, 4299 (65.1%) were non-Hispanic White, and 313 (4.7%) were other race or ethnicity. There were 700 RSV-vaccinated (10.4%) and 6046 unvaccinated (89.6%) adults. Among 3219 unvaccinated adults who responded to RSV knowledge questions, 1519 (47.2%) had not heard of RSV or were unsure; 2525 of 3218 (78.5%) were unsure if they were eligible for RSV vaccine or thought they were not.

In this retrospect study we wanted to introduce a possibility of curing ureteral strictures depending on their type and degree with the use of self-expanding ureteral stents (SUS). 33 patients with ureteral strictures received endourological treatment with the use of Allium® SUS (2 patients with SUS placed on both sides). Patients were divided into 2 groups: patients with uncomplicated strictures (Grp 1) and patients with complicated strictures (Grp 2). Uncomplicated stricture was defined as a single stricture below 2 cm. A complicated stricture was defined as a stricture over 2 cm and/or multiple strictures. The follow-up time was 24 months. All patients were scheduled for renoscintigraphy during the treatment. A full therapeutic success was defined as no tight stenosis in renoscintigraphic furosemide test after SUS explantation. In Grp 1, full therapeutic success was achieved in 80% of patients, which was statistically significant (p < 0.001). Serious complications (Clavien-Dindo > 3a) occurred significantly more often in Grp 2 (p = 0.046). Renal outflow during stenting was present in 70% of the patients in Grp 2. A full therapeutic success of endoscopic, SUS-assisted treatment can be considered among patients with short, single ureteral stricture. In long and/or multiple strictures, SUS can be used as drainage element, but full recovery of the stricture is unlikely.",,,urologpolska@gmail.com.

In making this transition, our institution noted a subjective decrease in the anesthetic requirements of patients undergoing the second stage of their prepectoral reconstruction. Despite this, there is little published literature on the topic. Therefore, our study aims to examine the differences in anesthetic requirements among patients with subpectoral versus prepectoral expanders at the time of exchange to permanent implants. We conducted a single-surgeon retrospective chart review of all patients undergoing breast reconstruction with tissue expanders from 2017 to 2024. We compared patients with prepectoral tissue expanders to those with subpectoral tissue expanders. Variables collected included perioperative pain medications, sedatives, muscle relaxers, antiemetics, reversal agents, and local anesthetics. Additional data were collected on steroids, diabetes, and hypertension medications and antibiotics used. A total of 251 patients met the criteria for evaluation, 71 subpectoral and 180 prepectoral. We found that subpectoral patients averaged a statistically significantly higher requirement of fentanyl and hydromorphone in the perioperative period. This group also had a significantly higher requirement of reversal agent and supplementary antiemetic medications. Other medications including those to manage infection, blood pressure, secretions, deep sedation, and awakening did not vary between groups. We found that patients with prepectoral tissue expanders undergoing exchange to permanent implants have decreased perioperative requirements of pain and antiemetic medications. Although the operative plane of choice in breast reconstruction is a multifaceted decision, we demonstrate that the prepectoral plane results in decreased pain medication burden in the perioperative period. Our study is the first to quantify these differences, allowing evidence-based decisions for patients and physicians.",,,

However, their use in the field of hair regeneration was limited by their poor production of exosomes. It has been discovered that intracellular vesicles (IVs), which are produced at a higher rate than exosomes, play a comparable biological purpose. As a result, we developed HTMI-MN, a microneedle that uses tremella, a type of Tremella polysaccharide (TPS), and hyaluronic acid (HA) as matrix materials. It has magnetic intracellular vesicles (Mag-IVs), which work in concert to treat androgenic alopecia (AGA) and encourage hair growth. After characterization of the Mag-IVs, we evaluated the effect on angiogenesis by scratch assay, angiogenesis assay, Western Blot and ELISA assay. In addition, we tested the protective effect of Human hair papillary cells (HHDPCs) by CCK-8 method, Western Blot and flow cytometry. Finally, the effects of tremella polysaccharide on M1/M2 polarization of macrophages were detected by fluorescence staining, Western Blot and flow cytometry. AGA model was established in vivo by DHT, and treatment was given by microneedle injection. Our study found that Mag-IVs have greater power to promote angiogenesis and protect HHDPCs from apoptosis compared to other vesicles. Besides, tremella polysaccharide can make the transformation of macrophages to anti-inflammatory phenotype. Taken together, in vivo experiments showed that hair regeneration was faster in HTMI-MN-treated mice. These results indicate that Mag-IVs and tremella polysaccharide can synergistically improve the hair microenvironment, which has a promising future for AGA treatment.",,,helen-1101@hotmail.com.

It was found that 15 days before hospitalization, a stray dog had attacked the child (near the school). During the attack, the boy's lens fell out of his right eye and the dog managed to salivate it. The child rinsed the lens with running water and put it back on. On hospital day 5, the patient's condition has become more severe. Paresis of the lower extremities was pronounced. When doing the Barre test, the boy could not keep his legs in an elevated position. Flexion and extension of legs with weakened strength. He could not get out of bed. The patient developed a sudden increase in body temperature (≥39.5°C), hyperhidrosis and cold extremities. He was lethargic and had difficulty concentrating on the interviewer's questions. Symptoms of tachypnea (32 breaths per minute), blue lips and acrocyanosis were associated with increasing respiratory failure. BP - 130/90 mm Hg, HR - 100 per minute. On the background of signs of respiratory failure and hemodynamic instability, biological death was stated (about 20 days after contact with the infected dog). A postmortem study confirmed the presence of street rabies virus in a bioassay on white mice. Typically, the incubation period for rabies ranges from 30 to 90 days. However, the entry of rabies virus onto the corneal surface can be equated to intracerebral infection, which ultimately predetermined the rapid spread of infections with a very short incubation period (only 15 days). Of note, our patient was already in the agitation period at the time of admission to the hospital, and the pathological changes in the CNS were irreversible. In summary, this clinical case highlights the importance of considering all possible routes of rabies virus transmission and increasing clinician vigilance regarding timely epidanamnesis collection for early rabies diagnosis, as only timely post-exposure prophylaxis can save the patient's life.",,,

Infectious diseases,10.1016/S1473-3099(25)00070-2,"The intention-to-diagnose principle, an analogue to the intention-to-treat principle in clinical trials, protects the foundation for inference in diagnostic test accuracy studies. This foundation provides for robust control of error rates during hypothesis testing and correct coverage probability during confidence interval estimation of accuracy parameters, in well defined populations for transparent generalisability. The intention-to-diagnose principle requires distinguishing between various non-positive non-negative (NPNN) test results, such as equivocal and invalid results, and appropriate handling of these distinct results during statistical analyses. Pragmatic application accuracy, pragmatic scientific accuracy, and explanatory scientific accuracy are three major research foci in studies of diagnostic test accuracy. Selection of appropriate analysis sets and appropriate handling of NPNN results depend on the specific focus. Selection has important implications regarding preservation of the foundation for statistical inference, generalisability, and comparability with results from other studies. We recommended analyses for diagnostic accuracy studies that include the estimation of accuracy parameters associated with each research foci. A free online tool is available to estimate these accuracy parameters. As with dedicated commitment to the intention-to-treat principle in clinical trials, commitment to application of the intention-to-diagnose principle will lead to studies with high integrity, a comprehensive understanding of the scientific and administration characteristics of the diagnostic test, clarity of interpretation and generalisability, and better clinical decision making.",Petrides V; Meier K; Galicia NP,Foundation Medicine; Silver Spring; Abbott,sevans@bsc.gwu.edu.

Primary outcome was number of self-reported moderate asthma exacerbations 12 months pre-index, overall, by maintenance treatment class and asthma control status at index, using the Asthma Control Test (ACT; poor [< 16], somewhat controlled [16-18], and controlled [> 19]) and 6-item Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ-6; uncontrolled [≥ 1.50], partially controlled [> 0.75-<1.50], and controlled [≤ 0.75]). Secondary outcomes included index ACT and ACQ-6 score, healthcare resource utilisation (HCRU) and direct costs 12 months pre- and post-index, stratified by self-reported moderate exacerbation frequency pre-index. Of 485 patients with ≥ 12 months' pre-index data, 86.6% (n = 420) self-reported moderate exacerbations, with similar frequency irrespective of maintenance treatment class (66.7-100.0%; ICS/LABA: 85.4%). Numerically greater proportions of patients self-reported a moderate exacerbation in the 12 months pre-index in ACT poor-control (n = 110/115 [95.7%]) and ACQ-6-uncontrolled (n = 200/210 [95.3%]) versus ACT- and ACQ-6-controlled (n = 205/260 [78.8%], n = 105/145 [72.4%]) groups. Symptom control worsened with increasing exacerbation frequency: mean (SD) ACT scores were 21.8 (3.3) and 15.7 (4.4) for patients with 0 or ≥ 7 events, respectively; mean (SD) ACQ-6 scores followed the same trend. Direct costs and HCRU increased with pre-index exacerbation frequency; mean (SD) all-cause and asthma-related total costs were £1509 (£2384) and £717 (£1459) for patients with no moderate exacerbations 12 months pre-index and £2002 (£2058) and £1086 (£1538) for patients with ≥ 7 exacerbations; similar trends occurred over 12 months post-index. Patients with asthma experience frequent moderate exacerbations, which are associated with poor asthma control, increased HCRU and costs, emphasising the poor quality of life patients experience.

Research from other countries indicates this may be shifting, but the last comprehensive survey of Canadian hormonal contraceptive usage was published in 2009. Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine current hormonal contraceptive usage among pre-menopausal Canadians. An online survey was distributed to pre-menopausal females aged 19-49 years via a third-party survey company. The survey included questions on respondents' demographics and current and past hormonal contraceptive use. Prevalence of current hormonal contraceptive use was calculated by age. Chi-squared tests were conducted to determine whether there was an association between contraceptive choice and various demographic categories. Responses of 2306 female Canadians (age 33.4 ± 8.1 years) were analyzed and 29% of these respondents were currently using hormonal contraceptives. The most common choices were oral contraceptives (56.4%) and intrauterine device (IUD) (28.4%). Over 30% of hormonal contraceptive users were currently using a long-acting reversible contraceptive method. These findings demonstrate a change in hormonal contraception use, notably an increase in the use of hormonal IUDs from 4 to 28% among Canadian hormonal contraceptive users over the last 15 years. This study also shows a high prevalence of alternative contraceptive options that may influence hormone levels differently than oral forms.",,,anita.cote@twu.ca.

Patients with severe episodes of COVID-19 are significantly more likely to be hospitalized in the following months. The pathophysiological mechanisms for delayed complications are still poorly understood, with a dissociation seen between ongoing symptoms and objective measures of cardiopulmonary health. COVID-19 is anticipated to alter the long-term trajectory of many chronic cardiovascular and pulmonary diseases, which are common among those at risk of severe disease. This study aims to use a single, integrated device-MouthLab, which measures 10 vital health parameters in 60 seconds-and a cloud-based proprietary analytics engine to develop and validate the Aidar Decompensation Index (AIDI), to predict decompensation in health among patients who previously had severe COVID-19. Overall, 200 participants will be enrolled. Inclusion criteria are patients in the US Department of Veterans Affairs health care system; ""severe"" COVID-19 infection during the acute phase, defined as requiring hospitalization, within 3-6 months before enrollment; aged ≥18 years; and having 1 of 6 prespecified chronic conditions. All participants will be instructed to use the MouthLab device to capture daily physiological data and complete monthly symptom surveys. Structured data collection tables will be developed to extract the clinical characteristics of those who experience decompensation events (DEs). The performance of the AIDI will depend on the magnitude of difference in physiological signals between those experiencing DEs and those who do not, as well as the time until a DE (ie, the closer to the event, the easier the prediction). Information about demographics, symptoms (Medical Research Council Dyspnea Scale and Post-COVID-19 Functional Status Scale), comorbidities, and other clinical characteristics will be tagged and added to the biomarker data. The resultant predicted probability of decompensation will be translated into the AIDI, where there will be a linear relationship between the risk score and the AIDI. To improve prediction accuracy, data may be stratified based on biological sex, race, ethnicity, or underlying clinical characteristics into subgroups to determine if there are differences in performance and detection lead times. Using appropriate algorithmic techniques, the study expects the model to have a sensitivity of >80% and a positive predicted value of >70%. Recruitment began in January 2023, and at the time of manuscript submission, 204 patients have been enrolled. Publication of the complete results and data from the study is expected in 2025. The focus on identifying predictor variables using a combination of biosensor-derived physiological features should enable the capture of heterogeneous characteristics of complications related to post-COVID-19 condition across diverse populations.

Given the complexity of CVRM spectrum diseases and the treatment landscape, treatment guidelines have been established to assist physicians in selecting the most appropriate treatment based on not only patients' primary disease but also their comorbidities. However, the impact of adherence to treatment guidelines on associated outcomes remains unclear. A systematic literature review was conducted to evaluate the impact of guideline-based treatment on clinical, economic, and quality-of-life (QoL) outcomes and related comorbidities in the CVRM spectrum or heart failure (HF) alone in individuals with T2DM. The MEDLINE, MEDLINE In-Process, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and EconLit electronic databases were searched to identify relevant peer-reviewed studies published in the United States, Canada, or Germany. The studies were screened and selected for inclusion or exclusion based on populations, interventions, comparators, and study design (PICOS) criteria. Of the 622 records identified, 28 publications met the inclusion criteria. In total, 11 and 16 studies reported adherence to clinical guidelines for T2DM and HF management, respectively. Adherence to T2DM and HF treatment guidelines decreased all-cause mortality and all-cause hospitalizations; furthermore, adherence to T2DM guidelines decreased hospitalizations due to HF, myocardial infarction, and stroke, and reduced T2DM-related long-term complications, while adherence to HF guidelines reduced hospitalizations due to HF. Evidence gaps were identified, including the need to assess the impact of guideline adherence on economic outcomes, the impact of adherence to diagnosis and monitoring guidelines, and the impact of guideline adherence on QoL outcomes. Adherence to disease management guidelines improves the outcomes of patients with T2DM or HF and reduces disease-related complications and hospitalizations; however, key evidence gaps exist, particularly regarding patients with T2DM along with comorbidities in the CVRM spectrum.",Vianini E; Pandey A; Rolland C; Ngubane N; Gilbert J; Ahmad A,Evidera; Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre; Boehringer Ingelheim International GmbH,elena.vianini@boehringer-ingelheim.com.

Part A,10.1002/jbm.a.37901,"Musculoskeletal knee injuries are common and debilitating, with the most prevalent soft tissue injuries being anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) and meniscal tears. These tears do not heal well naturally, and biological therapies involving scaffolds are often unsuccessful, due in part to the synovial fluid environment of the joint. Viscous synovial fluid contains high concentrations of degradative enzymes, including plasmin, which prevents the stable formation of provisional fibrin scaffolds. Lack of provisional scaffold formation prevents bridging of torn tissue and subsequent remodeling for permanent tissue repair. Coagulation factors such as fibrinogen and thrombin, reinforced with synthetic platelet-like particles (PLPs), can be introduced to synovial fluid to promote fibrin scaffold formation. PLPs bind to and retract fibrin fibers to enhance stiffness, density, and stability of fibrin scaffolds. Therefore, the objective of this work is to investigate the role of PLPs in enhancing fibrin scaffold formation and degradation capabilities within synovial fluid and to characterize the resulting scaffold structure, density, and mechanics. We investigated effects in synovial fluid with high or low viscosity, as viscosity can change with injury and can vary between individuals. Following the addition of clotting factors and PLPs to synovial fluid, we found an increase in fibrin scaffold density, structure, and maximum mechanics for low viscosity, but not high viscosity, synovial fluid groups. Furthermore, by lowering the viscosity of synovial fluid with hyaluronidase, the increase in scaffold density following PLP addition was restored, indicating the strong role of synovial fluid viscosity on stable scaffold formation. This technology contributes to the development of a more robust fibrin-based therapy for intra-articular musculoskeletal injuries.",,,

In contrast to traditional single-treatment approaches, multiple-treatment methods enable the simultaneous detection and removal of water pollutants using a single material. This innovation not only offers convenience but also fosters a more holistic and effective approach to water remediation. Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are versatile porous materials that offer significant potential for use in wastewater treatment. This article examines the latest developments in the application of MOFs for multifaceted wastewater treatment. MOFs are used for simultaneous detection and removal, or for the detection and degradation of contaminants. Some MOFs exhibited different functions for different contaminants, and some MOFs showed one function (adsorption or detection) for more than one contaminant. All the multifunctional MOFs facilitate the multiple treatment of the real wastewater. Lastly, existing challenges and future outlooks concerning MOF materials for wastewater treatment are also addressed in this paper.",,,

This study optimized plant-derived extracellular matrix scaffolds as a scalable and biocompatible alternative to synthetic grafts and autologous vessels. We refined decellularization protocols to achieve >95% DNA removal while preserving mechanical properties comparable to native vessels, significantly enhancing endothelial cell seeding. Leatherleaf viburnum leaves were decellularized using sodium dodecyl sulfate-based and Trypsin/Tergitol-based treatments, achieved via clearing in bleach and Triton X-100 for 6 to 72 h. To assess the environmental influence on scaffold performance, leaves from multiple collection sites were processed using sodium dodecyl sulfate-based protocols. Scaffold performance was evaluated through tensile testing and histological analysis to assess structural integrity, while DNA quantification and endothelial cell recellularization measured biological compatibility. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-treated scaffolds with shorter clearing durations demonstrated the highest DNA removal (≥95%) while preserving mechanical properties, significantly outperforming Trypsin/Tergitol treatments. Longer clearing times reduced fiber diameter by 60%, compromising scaffold strength. Shorter clearing times preserved extracellular matrix integrity and significantly improved endothelial cell seeding efficiency. Larger leaves supported significantly higher endothelial cell densities than smaller leaves, highlighting the need for standardized material sources. Permeability tests demonstrated minimal leakage at 120 mmHg and structural stability under dynamic flow conditions, suggesting their suitability for vascular applications.

40137008,Preliminary Study on the Development of a Real-Time Pressure-Monitoring Facial Mask for Burn Rehabilitation.,,European burn journal,10.3390/ebj6010012,"The most common aftereffect of severe burns in patients is hypertrophic scarring. Hypertrophic scars typically form following severe burns; it refers to excessive collagen production in the dermal layer during the healing process, resulting in an abnormal raised scar. Currently, practical treatments for suppressing hypertrophic scars include laser therapy, pressure therapy, and the application of silicone sheets for moisture retention. The most extensively used treatment involves compression therapy using specially designed garments for the affected areas. However, this method has limitations when applied to curved surfaces like the face. To address this issue, three-dimensional (3D) scanning and 3D printing techniques have been actively developed for face masks and have shown promising clinical results. Unfortunately, current facial masks under development lack a sensor system to measure pressure, making it difficult to ensure consistent and appropriate pressures during clinical trials. In this study, we have developed a burn pressure mask capable of real-time pressure monitoring. The facial mask developed in this study utilizes an FSR-type sensor to measure the pressure applied to the skin. We have also embedded electrical wires within the mask to enhance its comfort and wearability. For this study, two patients wore the facial mask with real-time pressure measurement capabilities for 4 weeks in 12 h per day on average. We evaluated whether the mask maintained the appropriate pressure range (15-25 mmHg) throughout the clinical trial and whether it effectively inhibited scar formation. Through the analysis of recorded pressure signal data, we confirmed that the patients consistently maintained the appropriate pressure while wearing the mask during the clinical trial. Additionally, we observed significant differences in skin moisture levels, transepidermal water loss, and scar thickness before and after the experiment. These findings suggest that the facial mask, featuring real-time monitoring capabilities, effectively prevents the formation of hypertrophic scars.",Cho YM; Youn HS,T&L Co.,

Of the total, 34.6% ($84.9 million) was allocated to non-research payments to HCOs for sponsoring HCOs' activities, and 19.6% ($49.0 million) were paid for lecturing and consulting fees, typically to individual HCPs. More than 80% of companies allocated a greater share of payments to non-research activities than to research. This study reveals substantial financial relationships between medical device companies and HCPs/HCOs in Japan, predominantly for non-research purposes. Improved transparency regulations, including a uniform, government-run database, are necessary to better oversee these financial interactions with medical device industry in Japan.",,,

Bespoke 3D-printed metal prostheses were designed and used for four patients. This study aimed to describe the design rationale and report the clinical outcomes. Between 2022 and August 2024, we followed up on four patients with significant bone defects and deformities caused by various factors, who opted against arthrodesis. These patients were treated with customized 3D-printed prostheses replacements. All cases underwent assessment through clinical and radiological examinations, evaluating parameters including passive range of motion (ROM) of the wrist, grip strength, VAS of pain, and functional scales such as the Mayo score, Patient-Rated Wrist Evaluation (PRWE), and Quick Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand (quick DASH) score. A paired t-test was conducted to compare pre- and postoperative outcomes. The mean follow-up period lasted 11.9 ± 6.7 months (range 6-18 months). All patients reported satisfying pain relief and enhanced function. The average ROM was 23.3° ± 5.7° of extension and 27.0° ± 18.6° of flexion. The average VAS score of pain was 1.5. The mean Mayo score, PRWE, and Quick DASH were 60.0, 31.5, and 28.3, respectively. No complications such as loosening, dislocation, or infection were observed during the follow-up period. Customized 3D-printed prosthetic replacements for severely destroyed wrists can provide good functional outcomes with a higher satisfaction rate. IV.",Liu M,AK Medical,
40133405,Calibration and performance of a Raman-based device for non-invasive glucose monitoring in type 2 diabetes.,2025-05-14,Scientific reports,10.1038/s41598-025-95334-x,"Raman spectroscopy has been demonstrated as a viable technique for non-invasive glucose monitoring (NIGM). However, its clinical utility is limited by an extended calibration period lasting several weeks. In this study, we address this limitation by employing a pre-trained calibration model, which is individualized through a brief calibration phase consisting of 10 measurements. The performance of the Raman-based NIGM device was evaluated in a clinical trial involving 50 individuals with type 2 diabetes over a 2-day study period. The protocol included a 4-h calibration phase on the first day, followed by validation phases of 4 h and 8 h on days 1 and 2, respectively. NIGM glucose readings were compared with capillary blood glucose measurements, with glucose fluctuations induced by standardized meal challenges. The numerical and clinical accuracy of the NIGM device was evaluated on 1918 paired points and expressed by mean absolute relative difference of 12.8% (95% CI 12.4, 13.2) and consensus error grid analysis showing 100% of NIGM readings in zones A and B. These results highlight the ability to reliably track blood glucose levels in people with type 2 diabetes. The successful introduction of a practical calibration scheme underlines Raman spectroscopy as a promising technology for NIGM and constitutes an important step towards factory calibration.",Pors A; Korzeniowska B; Rasmussen MT; Lorenzen CV; Rasmussen KG; Inglev R; Philipps A; Weber A,RSP Systems,andersw@rspsystems.com.
40132186,Consumer Engagement With Risk Information on Prescription Drug Social Media Pages: Findings From In-Depth Interviews.,2025-05-14,Journal of medical Internet research,10.2196/67361,"The volume of digital drug promotion has grown over time, and social media has become a source of information about prescription drugs for many consumers. Pharmaceutical companies currently present risk information about prescription drugs they promote in a variety of ways within and across social media platforms. There is scarce research on consumers' interactions with prescription drug promotion on social media, particularly on which features may facilitate or inhibit consumers' ability to find, review, and comprehend drug information. This is concerning because it is critical for consumers to know and weigh drug benefits and risks to be able to make informed decisions regarding medical treatment. We aimed to develop an understanding of the user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) of social media pages and posts created by pharmaceutical companies to promote drugs and how UI or UX design features impact consumers' interactions with drug information. We conducted in-person interviews with 54 consumers segmented into groups by device type (laptop or mobile phone), social media platform (Facebook or Instagram), and age. Interviewers asked participants to navigate to and review a series of 4 pages and 3 posts on their assigned device and platform. Interviewers encouraged participants to ""think aloud,"" as they interacted with the stimuli during a brief observation period. Following each observation period, participants were asked probing questions. An analyst reviewed video recordings of the observation periods to abstract quantitative interaction data on whether a participant clicked on or viewed risk information at each location it appeared on each page. Participants' responses were organized in a metamatrix, which we used to conduct thematic analysis. Observational data revealed that 59% of participants using Facebook and 70% of participants using Instagram viewed risk information in at least 1 possible location on average across all pages tested during the observation period. There was not a single location across the Facebook pages that participants commonly clicked on to view risk information. However, a video with scrolling risk information attracted more views than other features. On Instagram, at least half of the participants consistently clicked on the highlighted story with risk information across the pages. Although thematic analysis showed that most participants were able to identify the official pages and risk information for each drug, auto-scrolling text and text size posed barriers to identification and comprehensive review for some participants. Participants generally found it more difficult to identify the drugs' indications than risks. Participants using Instagram more frequently reported challenges identifying risks and indications compared to those using Facebook. UI or UX design features can facilitate or pose barriers to users' identification, review, and comprehension of the risk information provided on prescription drugs' social media pages and posts.",Amoozegar JB; Williams P; Giombi KC; Richardson C; Shenkar E; Watkins RL; O'Donoghue AC; Sullivan HW,US Food and Drug Administration; RTI International,

Bio,10.1016/j.mtbio.2025.101574,"Cell encapsulation strategies including macro- and micro-delivery devices have been widely used in cell therapy due to their ability to provide immunoprotection to the transplanted cells. While both strategies can provide mechanical and physiochemical support for maintaining cell survival and function, they each have their limitations. In this study, we report the design and fabrication of a hybrid implant combining the advantages of both macro- and micro-cell delivery devices. The hybrid implant comprises a microwell-array macroporous device fabricated from non-degradable clinically approved polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) combined with immunoprotective alginate microcapsules. The microwell design provides a vessel to retain individual microcapsules, while the pores enable unhindered mass transport of nutrients and oxygen to the encapsulated cells and support vascular ingrowth. We show that both rodent pseudoislets and primary human islets maintain their viability and function inside the hybrid implant in a proof-of-concept study. Mechanically, it is strong and flexible suitable for surgical handling and for eventual retrieval for replacement. The hybrid implant also supports the growth of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) across its surface allowing ",,,

Long-term management aimed at reducing complications and maximizing quality of life is essential. Compression stockings are crucial in this management; however, their application is limited by patient experience (ease of wear, texture, breathability, and appearance). This highlights the need to evaluate alternative compression garments that maintain therapeutic efficacy while improving patient adherence. We developed a novel compression denim product (Flow plus Jeans®) using advanced sewing technology. Its baseline performance (compression ability) was evaluated by measuring pressure gradients at three points (ankle, calf, and thigh) using a mannequin-based compression testing system and compared with those of existing stockings. Thereafter, a safety assessment was conducted on healthy volunteers to evaluate potential adverse effects, including changes in lower limb circumference, signs of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) via ultrasound, and skin complications. A clinical trial in patients with lymphedema was then performed to compare its efficacy with that of conventional compression stockings. Baseline performance testing with a mannequin revealed that Flow plus Jeans demonstrated compression levels and pressure gradients at three calf points comparable to those of standard compression stockings. A safety study involving nine healthy volunteers confirmed that Flow plus Jeans caused no significant changes in lower-limb circumferences after three days of wear, with no cases of DVT or skin complications. In a subsequent clinical trial involving nine female patients with lymphedema, the jeans showed non-inferiority to existing stockings concerning lower-limb circumference measurements at six points (pre-use vs. six months post-use), with patient-reported experiences assessed via questionnaires. Notably, patients reported enhanced satisfaction regarding the jeans' fashionability, which could serve as an incentive for long-term adherence. Our findings suggest that Flow plus Jeans represent a promising novel option for the long-term management of lymphedema, offering an alternative that balances medical efficiency with improved patient satisfaction and demonstrates safety in healthy individuals.",Takahashi T; Matsuoka A; Yamada S,Division of Production Engineering; Division of Business Management; Division of Sales,

Twenty-four (77%) had aggressive lymphoma, 7 (24%) had indolent lymphoma (follicular lymphoma and marginal zone lymphoma). The median number of previous therapies was 5 (range 2-13, interquartile range [IQR] 3-5). All enrolled patients received MB-CART-19. Median apheresis to infusion time was 13 days (range 9-20, IQR 9-13). One dose limiting toxicity (DLT) was observed in dose escalation (fatal cytokine release syndrome [CRS]), whereas one patient died in dose expansion secondary to hemophagocytic syndrome. Both deaths were considered treatment-related. Twenty (65%) patients had CRS, three (10%) grade ≥3.

The study aimed to determine the value of synovial D-dimer, rather than serum, in diagnosing PJI. This prospective study enrolled 17 patients with chronic knee PJI (the PJI group) and 52 with primary knee osteoarthritis (the control group). PJI was defined using the 2018 International Consensus Meeting Criteria. Synovial D-dimer, plasma D-dimer, serum erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and serum C-reactive protein levels were measured. Synovial fluid D-dimer levels were determined using an enzyme-linked fluorescence assay. The performance of each biomarker in diagnosing PJI was evaluated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. The median synovial D-dimer level was significantly higher in the PJI group at (927,095 ng/ml, IQR 566,882-1,215,066) than in the control group (20,954 ng/ml, IQR 10,350-46,493) (P < 0.001). When the synovial D-dimer threshold value was determined to be 236,804 ng/ml, the sensitivity was 100% (CI 93.2-100%), and the specificity was 94.12% (95% CI 71.3-99.9). The area under the curve determined by ROC analysis was 0.992 (95% CI 0.992-1.000, P < 0.0001). Patients with chronic knee PJI have significantly high synovial D-dimer levels, demonstrating that an increase in fibrinolytic activity coexists with an infection-induced inflammatory response. Synovial D-dimer levels appear to be valuable biomarkers for diagnosing PJI. However, further studies are required to evaluate the role of this novel biomarker.",,,zcangunes@gmail.com.

We described their VW and evaluated clinical outcomes, adherence, safety, and patient satisfaction. Retrospective, single-center study of patients admitted to the WWL VW service from January 14, 2022 to January 31, 2024. Clinical data collected by WWL in their database for patients admitted to the VW, were matched to data captured automatically by the Current Health (CH) platform linked to the CH remote monitoring kits assigned to patients on the VW. The CH kits enabled the VW care at WWL and included a wearable device for continuous vital signs monitoring, a blood pressure cuff, and tablet. Evaluation metrics included clinical scope, clinical outcomes, adherence, safety, and patient satisfaction. There were 1835 admissions and a 93% match rate between the clinical and CH databases. About 38% of referrals were step-up (31% ambulatory care and 7% primary care) and 62% of referrals were step-down (100% inpatients). Most specialty referrals were from thoracic and acute medicine (77%). The median length of stay on the VW was 8 days [IQR 5-13], 209 (12%) admissions were escalated to the hospital, 179 (11%) escalated to the emergency department out of hours, and 29 (2%) signposted to urgent medical services. Adherence to the wearable device was 92%. There were 38 minor safety incidents (typically hypersensitivity reactions or administrative errors) and 17 expected deaths. About 94% of admissions rated the VW experience as ""excellent"" or ""good."" Results were similar between step-up and step-down referrals. We have shown the VW service yielded acceptable clinical outcomes, was safe with no serious adverse events or negative impact on mortality rate. Patient adherence to the technology and satisfaction with the VW service were high. The VW service was innovative in its acceptance of a broad range of patients, expanding services beyond respiratory medicine, and in developing a step-up pathway, preventing some patients from ever taking up an acute bed in the hospital.",Pugmire J; Ashish A; Chadwick A; Wilkes M; Meekin D; Zaniello B; Zahradka N,Best Buy Health Inc.; Wrightington,

Despite its high prevalence and potential impact on diabetes management and outcomes, published data regarding the risk factors for the development of this complication are contradictory. The study aimed to determine risk factors for lipohypertrophy related to patient characteristics and insulin therapy. Medical databases (MEDLINE/PubMed, Embase, CENTRAL) were searched from 1990 to August 21, 2023. All relevant studies describing potential risk factors for lipohypertrophy in people with insulin-treated diabetes (eg, sex, age, body mass index [BMI], type of diabetes, and injection technique) were included. Data enabling calculations of prevalence odds ratios (pOR) and mean differences (MD) with 95% confidence intervals [95% CI] were extracted and pooled in meta-analyses. Fifty-one studies of risk factors for lipohypertrophy were identified. Performed meta-analyses indicate that the strongest contributor to lipohypertrophy was incorrect injection site rotation (pOR = 8.85 [95% CI: 5.10-15.33]), followed by needle reuse (3.20 [1.99-5.13]), duration of insulin therapy >5 years (2.62 [1.70-4.04]) and >2 daily injections per day (2.27 [1.58-3.25]). Those with type 1 diabetes and obese/overweight individuals also had significantly higher odds of developing lipohypertrophy. Sex, age, and insulin device (pen, syringes) were not significant risk factors for lipohypertrophy. This systematic review with meta-analysis revealed that incorrect injection site rotation and needle reuse are the most substantial factors in developing lipohypertrophy. Notably, both factors are modifiable through patient education, emphasizing the importance of teaching proper injection techniques for better diabetes management.",Fornengo R; Heinemann L; Monica M; Nguyen T; Sieber J; Reznik Y; Ryś P; Stożek-Tutro A,HTA Consulting; Science Consulting in Diabetes GmbH; Dipartimento di Area Medica; Endocrinology and Diabetes Department; Embecta,

It is also a major contributor to premature mortality, years lived with disability, and rising healthcare costs around the world. Despite the availability of proven therapies and interventions that could vastly decrease the burden of cardiovascular disease and cardiometabolic conditions, their implementation is poor, with generally less than half of patients being treated with the most effective therapies. Implementation science offers promise in bridging this gap and mitigating disparities. However, even though small studies have shown that there are effective methods to improve the implementation of evidence-based therapies, these methods have not been scaled to make an impact at the level of health systems or nationally. A coordinated, multi-stakeholder approach is essential to identify barriers to implementation on a broad scale and, more critically, to develop and deploy practical solutions. The Duke Clinical Research Institute conducted an Implementation Summit entitled ""Scalability, Spread, and Sustainability"" to explore strategies for advancing the uptake of evidence-based interventions for cardiometabolic diseases in healthcare in the United States. This manuscript presents the participants' multi-stakeholder perspective on the steps necessary to improve the implementation of evidence-based therapies in cardiometabolic disease.

SS is very low, and overall disposal practices are environmentally unfriendly (e.g., 8-84% flushing into toilets). Pad quantities generated from one menstruator/month are 288.4 g (259.6 g plastic), 360.5 g (324.5 g plastic), and 432.6 g (389.3 g plastic) (from a 5 mL blood-soaked 5 g pad); 436.8 g (393.1 g plastic), 546 g (491.4 g plastic), and 655.2 g (589.7 g plastic) (from a 10 mL blood-soaked 5 g pad); and 568.4 g (511.6 g plastic), 710.5 g (639.5 g plastic), and 852.6 g (767.3 g plastic) (from a 5 mL blood-soaked 15 g pad), and cloths/menstruator/month are 199.4 g, 249.2 g, and 299 g (from a 5 g material) at changing frequencies of 4, 5, and 6 times/day, respectively. Nevertheless, cloth waste quantities that get disposed for any given year are substantially less (due to reuse) compared with sanitary pad wastes. Soiled MHPs are not categorized as infectious wastes or household hazardous wastes in Sri Lanka. Legislative changes with planning of proper SS, collection, and disposal and the use of cotton cloths and/or other environmentally friendly MHPs are suggested.",,,aselaranil4@gmail.com.

A cross-sectional database and bibliometric analysis. Open Payments Database and PubMed. Publications by the 10 highest-compensated otolaryngologists from each of 12 representative medical device and drug companies from 2018 to 2020 were assessed for disclosure of potential conflicts of interest in the years following payment through 2023. After excluding 52 physicians who did not publish in this period, 102 individuals received a combined $8,473,091.68, with an individual median of 15 payments (interquartile range [IQR] = 47) and median compensation of $18,522.77 (IQR = $53,965.52) from 1 or more of the 12 companies analyzed. The median number of publications per author was 10 (IQR = 25), and the median h-index of the authors was 16 (IQR = 28). Of the 1735 publications, 114 were classified as relevant, either because the study involved the evaluation of a device manufactured by one of the analyzed companies or because one of the companies funded the study. Of these, 23 (20.1%) were missing personal disclosure by the author. Of the physicians analyzed, the most represented subspecialty was rhinology (n = 47, 31%) followed by otology (n = 18, 11.8%). Although most publications in the years following payments from device companies were not deemed to have potential conflicts of interest, a notable proportion of those with authors who received payments lacked relevant financial disclosure. As transparency of relevant industry relationships has received increased attention, appropriate disclosure is recommended.",,,

Immunoglobulin E (IgE) serves as a key biomarker for allergic diseases, often measured in blood serum by ELISA immunoassays. Despite recent interest in minimally invasive sampling of biological fluids, the low sample volumes and IgE concentrations demand highly sensitive methodologies, typically confined to centralized laboratories. In this article, a decentralizable approach based on competitive immunoassays using Pd nanocluster (PdNCs)-labelled antibodies for electrochemical detection is proposed. With this aim, PdNCs were successfully bioconjugated with an anti-hIgE antibody to perform competitive immunoassays. To improve the analytical capabilities of the methodology, disposable screen-printed carbon electrodes with dual working electrodes were used for enhancing precision.

While lateral locked plating and intramedullary nailing were shown to have similar rates of non-union, nail-plate combinations (NPC) have been shown to have higher rates of union and improved clinical outcomes compared to single constructs (SC). The purpose of this meta-analysis was to compare NPC and SC in the treatment of DFFs. PubMed, Cochrane, and Google Scholar databases (pages 1-20) were queried through October 2024. Studies that compared NPC to SC in patients with DFF were included. Outcomes including overall complications, specific complications (implant failure, heterotopic ossification (HO), nonunion, malunion, and surgical site infection (SSI)), reoperations, immediate post-operative weight-bearing status, and surgery-related parameters (operative room (OR) time, estimated blood loss (EBL), and length of stay (LOS)) were compared between the two groups. Five retrospective studies including 637 patients met the inclusion criteria (146 patients in the NPC group and 491 patients in the SC group). The NPC group had a lower rate of overall complications (OR 0.21, p < 0.001), reoperations (OR 0.29, p < 0.001), implant failure (OR 0.15, p = 0.01), non-unions (OR 0.12, p < 0.001), and malunion (OR 0.29, p = 0.03). Furthermore, the NPC group had a lower rate of patients instructed to be non-weightbearing post-operatively (OR 0.06; p < 0.001). There was no difference in HO, SSI, OR time, EBL or LOS between the 2 groups. The present meta-analysis demonstrates a reduced rate of complications, reoperations, implant failure, nonunions and malunions in patients undergoing NPC for DFFs. III.",,,mohdaher1@hotmail.com.

Existing spectroscopic techniques are usually slow and not compatible with flow-through systems. Here we analyze single microparticles in the 10-24 μm range using a combination of two electronic sensors in the same microfluidic system: a microwave capacitive sensor and a resistive pulse sensor. Together, this integrated sensor system yields an electrical signature of the analyte particles for their differentiation. To simplify data analysis, 3D electrode arrangements were used instead of planar electrodes so that the generated signal is unaffected by the height of the particle in the microfluidic channel. With this platform, we were able to distinguish between polystyrene (PS) and polyethylene (PE) microparticles. We showcase the sensitivity and speed of this technique and discuss the implications for the future application of microwave cytometry technology in the environmental and biomedical fields.",,,
40099777,Effect of Targeting ApoC-III With Plozasiran on Lipoprotein Particle Size and Number in Hypertriglyceridemia.,2025-05-15,Journal of the American College of Cardiology,10.1016/j.jacc.2025.03.496,"Plozasiran, an investigational siRNA targeting hepatic apoC-III, reduces triglyceride-rich lipoproteins (TRLs). The impact of plozasiran on lipoprotein particle numbers and sizes is unknown. However, reductions in the number of TRL particles (TRL-P) and a shift to possibly less atherogenic large low-density lipoprotein particles (LDL-P) are expected. This study aimed to determine the impact of plozasiran on lipoprotein particle concentration and subclass distribution using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) in 2 phase 2 studies. Patients (N = 403) from SHASTA-2 (severe hypertriglyceridemia) and MUIR (mixed hyperlipidemia) were administered 2 total subcutaneous doses of plozasiran (10, 25, or 50 mg) or placebo at baseline and week 12. Comprehensive lipoprotein profiling was conducted with NMR. In SHASTA-2, there was a dose-dependent reduction in TRL-P, with placebo-adjusted total TRL-P reductions of -46% and reductions across all TRL subclasses with plozasiran. While total LDL-P was unchanged, large LDL-P concentration increased by +53% and medium by +56%; small LDL-P trended lower (-13%). Total HDL-P increased by +8%, primarily driven by a +36% increase in large high-density lipoprotein particles (HDL-Ps). Similarly, in MUIR, there were dose-dependent reductions in TRL-P, with total TRL-P significantly reduced by -48% (pooled plozasiran) and reductions across all TRL subclasses with plozasiran. While total LDL-P was unchanged, large and medium LDL-P levels increased by +88% and +46%, respectively; small LDL-P levels decreased by -28%. Total HDL-P increased by +12%, driven by a +83% increase in large HDL-P. Plozasiran induced reductions in apoC-III and showed potentially favorable quantitative and qualitative changes in lipoproteins as assessed by NMR in patients with hypertriglyceridemia and mixed hyperlipidemia. Plozasiran reduced TRL-P by ∼50%, shifted LDL to larger particles, and modestly increased HDL-P concentration. While high-potency TRL-lowering therapies can lead to an overall LDL-C increase, plozasiran did not increase LDL-P or apoB but shifted LDL particle size distribution from small dense LDL toward larger sizes. The ∼50% reduction in TRL-P with no increase in apoB and possibly beneficial qualitative changes in LDL suggests the potential of plozasiran to lower cardiovascular risk, which may be evaluated in a prospective outcomes trial.",Gaudet D; Zhou R; Melquist S; Hellawell J; Leeper NJ,Biostatistics Department; Department of Medicine; Program Management Department; Department of Surgery; Clinical Development,cmb@bcm.edu.

Therefore, centralization is recommended. However, in inguinal hernia surgery the data are limited. The study is based on a retrospective analysis of prospective data from the German Herniamed Registry collected between 2009 and 2018. Out of the total of 731,982 patients operated on in 737 institutions, patients who had undergone inguinal hernia repair in Lichtenstein or in laparo-endoscopic (TAPP/TEP) technique were included. Hospitals were divided into three annual caseload categories: Low volume: ≤ 75 cases; middle volume: 76-199 cases; high volume: ≥ 200 cases. The relationship between hospital volume and the outcome parameters was analyzed using multivariable binary logistic models. 222,487 patients were enrolled in analysis, with 70.4% hernias operated on in laparo-endoscopic technique and 29.6% cases in open mesh technique. Overall, the outcome after laparo-endoscopic repair was significantly favorable except for the intraoperative complications (worse) and recurrence rate (no significant difference). Descriptive and multivariable analysis identified a long operating time as the main factor associated with an unfavorable outcome. In low-volume hospitals the risk was higher for intraoperative complications as well as for postoperative complications in both techniques. There was a significantly favorable association between the recurrence rate and hospital volume but only after laparo-endoscopic repair. Patients who were operated on in a low-volume center experienced significantly less pain across all three pain categories, independently of the technique used. While hospital volume has a favorable association with most outcome parameters, this varied in accordance with the operative technique used. In contrast to open surgery, laparo-endoscopic surgery in a low-volume hospital (≤ 75) has the disadvantage of a higher recurrence rate. Long operating time is the most detrimental factor, proving that surgeon proficiency is of paramount importance. However, chronic postoperative inguinal pain (CPIP) syndrome is significantly less frequent in patients operated on in low-volume hospitals; this result is difficult to explain but may be due to a closer patient-surgeon relationship in these institutions.",Unger S; Adolf D,Cancer Registry Sachsen gGmbH; Department of Biometry and Data Management,bittnerfamilie@web.de.
40096865,Evaluation of focused ultrasound modulation of the blood-brain barrier in gray and white matter.,2025-04-13,Journal of controlled release : official journal of the Controlled Release Society,10.1016/j.jconrel.2025.113631,"Focused ultrasound (FUS) in combination with intravenous microbubbles is being studied clinically for modulation of the blood-brain barrier. Contrast-enhanced MRI can be used to visualize the enhanced permeability resulting from the treatment. However, contrast enhancement in the white matter (WM) are inconsistently observed compared to the gray matter (GM). Intrinsic tissue differences are believed to result in reduced treatment efficacy and insufficient drug delivery to the WM. In this study we evaluate the deposition of MRI contrast and clinically relevant antineoplastics in GM and WM tissues following single and repeated FUS and microbubble treatments. The brains of Fischer-344 rats (n = 24) and Yorkshire pigs (n = 6) underwent FUS (rats: 580 kHz; pigs: 220 kHz) treatments targeting the internal capsule and thalamus, repeated at 30-min intervals. Definity microbubbles (rats: 20 μL/kg bolus; pigs: 4 μL/kg/5-min infusion) were administered intravenously for each sonication with MRI contrast to measure gadolinium-mediated signal change. Feedback-controlled algorithms were used to monitor treatments and modulate the pressure based on emitted microbubble signals to ensure safe and effective exposures. The delivery of methotrexate (MTX; 454.4 Da) and bevacizumab (BVZ; 149 kDa) was evaluated via immunofluorescence microscopy in rats, and respectively quantified via liquid chromatography mass spectrometry and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in pigs. Repeated FUS exposures successfully increased the vascular permeability of both gray and white matter tissues to MRI contrast and drugs of both small and large molecular sizes. In rats, single treatments showed statistically significant higher enhancements in the GM (23.5 ± 4.3 %; WM: 4.68 ± 3.75 %), however following a second sonication there were no between-tissue differences (GM: 38.0 ± 6.4 %; WM: 34.0 ± 8.7 %). In pigs, the smaller focus size relative to the brain enabled separate targeting of GM vs WM and the treatment controller used higher average power level in the WM to achieve the same cavitation dose. This resulted in no difference in gray and white matter permeability levels (to both contrast and pharmacological agents) after a single sonication. Repeated treatments sustained MRI enhancements for a longer time and enhanced drug deposition (MTX increased 6.5 and 8.3 folds after single and repeated treatment; BVZ increased 6.8 and 20.4 folds respectively). Feedback-controlled algorithms and the possibility to individually target gray and white matter highlighted the impact of tissue composition on treatment outcomes. Repeated FUS-mediated modulation of the brain microvasculature achieved higher levels of permeabilization to contrast and pharmacological agents in both gray and white matter.",,,alex.demaio@mail.utoronto.ca.

Unlike conventional DBIM methods that rely solely on secondary incident fields, S-TwIST incorporates deterministic induced currents to achieve more accurate total field approximation. The algorithm's performance is validated using both synthetic ""Austria"" profiles and 45 digital breast phantoms derived from the UWCEM repository. The results demonstrate robust reconstruction capabilities across varying noise levels (0-20 dB SNR), achieving average relative errors of 0.4847% in breast tissue reconstruction without requiring prior noise level knowledge.

Studies have been conducted on the general ergonomic effects of exoskeletons in production environments; however, it remains challenging to predict the biomechanical effects these devices may have in specific jobs.

The exoskeleton was studied to model it in the Forces method using a four-phase approach based on experimental observations (Phase 1) and objective data collection via motion capture with inertial sensors and load cells for lifting load movements. From the experimentation the angles of each body segment, the effort perceived by the user, and the activation conditions were obtained (Phase 2).

This study tackles the challenge of optimizing both control accuracy and response speed in trajectory tracking for lower-limb exoskeleton hip robots. We introduce an optimization strategy that integrates the Sparrow Search Algorithm (SSA) with fuzzy Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) control. This approach addresses the inefficiencies and time-consuming process of manual parameter tuning, thereby improving trajectory tracking performance. First, recognizing the complexity of hip joint motion, which involves multiple degrees of freedom and intricate dynamics, we employed the Lagrangian method. This method is particularly effective for handling nonlinear systems and simplifying the modeling process, allowing for the development of a dynamic model for the hip joint. The SSA is subsequently utilized for the online self-tuning optimization of both the proportional and quantization factors within the fuzzy PID controller. Simulation experiments confirm the efficacy of this strategy in tracking hip joint trajectories during flat walking and standing hip flexion rehabilitation exercises. Experimental results from diverse test populations demonstrate that SSA-fuzzy PID control improves response times by 27.8% (for flat walking) and 30% (for standing hip flexion) when compared to traditional PID control, and by 6% and 2%, respectively, relative to fuzzy PID control. Regarding tracking accuracy, the SSA-fuzzy PID approach increases accuracy by 81.4% (for flat walking) and 80% (for standing hip flexion) when compared to PID control, and by 57.5% and 56.8% relative to fuzzy PID control. The proposed strategy significantly improves both control accuracy and response speed, offering substantial theoretical support for rehabilitation training in individuals with lower-limb impairments. Moreover, in comparison to existing methods, this approach uniquely tackles the challenges of parameter tuning and optimization, presenting a more efficient solution for trajectory tracking in exoskeleton systems.",Yue Z,Shandong Jite Industrial Technology Co.,

We integrated a battery charging controller module into the TETS, enabling it to recharge an implanted Lithium-Ion (Li-Ion) battery that powers low-power-rated Circulatory Assist Devices, or left ventricular assist devices (LVADs). Benchtop measurements demonstrated that the TETS delivered energy from the implanted coils to the battery charging module, at a charging rate of up to 2900 J/h, presented an average temperature increase (ΔT) of 3 °C. We conducted in vivo measurements using four porcine models followed by histopathological analysis of the skin tissue in the implanted coils areas. The thermal profile analysis from the in vivo measurements and the calculated charging rates from the current and voltage waveforms, in porcine models, indicated that the charging rate and temperature varied for each model. The maximum energy charging rate observed was 2200 J/h, with an average ΔT of 3 °C.

40086269,Differences in door-to-device times in a retrospective cohort of patients with ischemic stroke who received CTA only or CTA and CTP imaging.,2025-03-28,Journal of stroke and cerebrovascular diseases : the official journal of National Stroke Association,10.1016/j.jstrokecerebrovasdis.2025.108272,"In the treatment of acute ischemic stroke, there are differing views about the utility of computerized tomography perfusion (CTP). Two approaches are employed depending on hospital preference. The first approach is to perform non-contrast computed tomography (CT) scans followed by vascular imaging with computed tomography angiography (CTA) for patients arriving within 6 h of last known well. In the first approach, CTP is reserved for patients who arrive 6-24 h after last known well. The second approach is to utilize both CTA and CTP regardless of the time window in which the patient presents. In this study, we sought to answer whether patients triaged with CTP and CTA had increased door-to-device times compared to those only triaged with CTA. We investigated a retrospective cohort of 1,357 patients with ischemic stroke who received endovascular therapy (EVT) and were triaged with CTA only or CTA and CTP. Patients were stratified by when they arrived at the hospital (<6 h and 6-24 h from last known well). Linear mixed-effects models (LMM) were used to investigate the association between door-to-device times and CTA/CTP usage. Our results showed that using CTP and CTA was not associated with increased time to treat compared to CTA alone. There was no increase in time from door to device in patients presenting within 6 h. Furthermore, for patients who arrived 6-24 h of last known well, the use of CTP and CTA was associated with an accelerated time to treatment with EVT. CTA and CTP usage was not associated with added time costs with respect to door-to-device in this patient cohort. Our results are consistent with other data showing that radiologists have faster read times when given both CTP and CTA. It is noteworthy that the majority of EVT patients in our dataset (70.6 %) presented in the <6-hour time window.",,,jason.tarpley@providence.org.
40085833,The Measurement of Vital Signs in Pediatric Patients by Lifelight Software in Comparison to the Standard of Care: Protocol for the VISION-Junior Observational Study.,2025-03-14,JMIR research protocols,10.2196/58334,"Measuring vital signs (VS) is important in potentially unwell children, as a change in VS may indicate a more serious infection than is clinically apparent or herald clinical deterioration. However, currently available methods are not suitable for regular measurement of VS in the home or community setting, and adherence can be poor. The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted a need for the contactless measurement of VS by nonclinical personnel, reinforced by the growing use of telemedicine. The Lifelight app is being developed as a medical device for the contactless measurement of VS using remote photoplethysmography via the camera on smart devices. The VISION-D (Measurement of Vital Signs by Lifelight Software in Comparison to the Standard of Care-Development) and -V (Validation) studies demonstrated the accuracy of the app compared with standard of care (SOC) measurement of blood pressure, pulse rate (PR), and respiratory rate (RR) in adults, supporting certification of Lifelight as a class I Conformité Européenne medical device. To support the development of the Lifelight app for pediatric patients, the VISION-Junior study is collecting high-quality data that will be used to develop algorithms for the measurement of VS (PR, RR, and oxygen saturation) in pediatric patients. The accuracy of the app will be assessed against SOC measurements made simultaneously with app measurements. The study is recruiting pediatric patients (younger than 18 years of age) attending the Sunderland Royal Hospital pediatric emergency department of the South Tyneside and Sunderland National Health Service Foundation Trust. High-resolution videos of the face (and torso in children younger than 5 years of age) and audio recordings (to explore the value of crying, wheezing, coughing, and other sounds in predicting illness) are made using the Lifelight Data Collect app. VS are measured simultaneously using SOC methods (finger clip sensor for PR and oxygen saturation; manual counting of RR). Feedback from patients, parents, carers, and nurses who use Lifelight is collected via questionnaires. Anticipated recruitment is 500 participants, with subtargets for age, sex, and skin tone distribution (Fitzpatrick 6-point scale). Early data will be used to refine the algorithms. A separate dataset will be retained to test the performance of the app against predefined targets. The study started on June 12, 2023, and reached its recruitment target (n=532) in April 2024 after extending the deadline. Algorithm refinement is in progress, after which the performance of Lifelight will be compared with the SOC measurement of VS. The analyses are expected to be completed by mid-August 2024. Data collected in this study will be used to develop and assess the accuracy of the app for the measurement of VS in pediatric patients of all ages.

Endoscopic examination and necropsy were performed at 15 weeks. A 50-cm bypass limb was unfeasible in the pigs, so the 4 test animals received 150-cm bypasses. By week 15, mean weight gain compared to baseline body weight was 3.6% in 3 surviving test animals and 10.5% in the 2 sham-controlled animals. Two asymptomatic gastrojejunal lumen-apposing metal stents and one asymptomatic duodenal exclusion device migration occurred during follow-up. One pig died on day 60 with intestinal volvulus finding on necropsy. In the surviving test pigs, bypass limb lengths were 360 cm, 120 cm, and 80 cm at necropsy.

This review aims to summarize the state-of-the-art of home-sampling methods for TDM and evaluates the analytical and clinical validation challenges. A comprehensive search was conducted across Embase, Medline, and Scopus. Eligible articles described analytical and/or clinical validation of home-sampling methods for oral targeted anticancer drugs. ASReview was used to process unique references and to identify relevant studies. Of the 39 included articles, 32 detailed on analytical validation experiments, while 27 covered clinical validation experiments. Dried blood spot and volumetric absorptive microsampling were the primary sampling methods. Key challenges were ensuring robust sample collection, sample pretreatment, hematocrit effects, and sample stability, which were generally thoroughly investigated. Clinical validation yielded promising results for most analytes, although external validation remains crucial for confirming reliability. Home-sampling methods for TDM of oral targeted anticancer drugs show promising results for clinical implementation. Methods for well-studied drugs may be clinically implemented immediately, while others require further external validation. Future research should address device-specific challenges and assess patient feasibility to facilitate the routine use of home-sampling in clinical practice.",,,

Mitochondria, essential for regenerative capabilities, provide the necessary energy for stem cell function. However, the specific roles of histone modifications and mitochondrial dynamics in human adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs) during morphological transformations remain poorly understood. In this study, we aim to elucidate the mechanisms by which ASC sphere formation enhances mitochondrial function, delivery, and rescue efficiency. ASCs were cultured on chitosan nano-deposited surfaces to form 3D spheres. Mitochondrial activity and ATP production were assessed using MitoTracker staining, Seahorse XF analysis, and ATP luminescence assays. Single-cell RNA sequencing, followed by Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA), was conducted to uncover key regulatory pathways, which were validated through molecular techniques. Pathway involvement was confirmed using epigenetic inhibitors or PPARγ-modulating drugs. Mitochondrial structural integrity and delivery efficiency were evaluated after isolation. Chitosan-induced ASC spheres exhibited unique compact mitochondrial morphology, characterized by condensed cristae, enhanced mitochondrial activity, and increased ATP production through oxidative phosphorylation. High expressions of mitochondrial complex I genes and elevated levels of mitochondrial complex proteins were observed without an increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS). Epigenetic modification of H3K27me3 and PPARγ involvement were discovered and confirmed by inhibiting H3K27me3 with the specific EZH2 inhibitor GSK126 and by adding the PPARγ agonist Rosiglitazone (RSG). Isolated mitochondria from ASC spheres showed improved structural stability and delivery efficiency, suppressed the of inflammatory cytokines in LPS- and TNFα-induced inflamed cells, and rescued cells from damage, thereby enhancing function and promoting recovery. Enhancing mitochondrial ATP production via the EZH2-H3K27me3-PPARγ pathway offers an alternative strategy to conventional cell-based therapies.

Four small business recipients of National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) small business grant funding collected a total of 416 customer discovery interviews during the 2021 National Institutes of Health (NIH) Innovation-Corps (I-Corps) program. Each business received funding to advance an OUD-specific innovation: therapeutics (2 companies), medical device (1 company), and Software as a Medical Device (SaMD) (1 company). Interview participants included stakeholders from a variety of disciplines of Substance Use Disorders (SUD) healthcare including clinicians, first responders, policymakers, relevant manufacturers, business partners, advocacy groups, regulatory agencies, and insurance companies. Agnostic to the type of product (therapeutic, device, or SaMD), several shared barriers were identified: (1) There is a lack of standardization across medical providers for managing patients with OUD, resulting in diverse implementation practices due to a fragmented healthcare policy; (2) Underlying Social Determinants of Health (SDOH) present unique challenges to medical care and contribute to poor outcomes in OUD; (3) Stigma thwarts adoption, implementation, and the development of innovative solutions; (4) Constantly evolving public health trends and legal policies impact development and access to OUD interventions. It is critical for innovators to have early interactions with the full range of OUD stakeholders to identify and quantify true unmet needs and to properly position development programs for commercial success.

40069254,Enhancing fetal ultrasound image quality and anatomical plane recognition in low-resource settings using super-resolution models.,2025-05-12,Scientific reports,10.1038/s41598-025-91808-0,"Super-resolution (SR) techniques present a suitable solution to increase the image resolution acquired using an ultrasound device characterized by a low image resolution. This can be particularly beneficial in low-resource imaging settings. This work surveys advanced SR techniques applied to enhance the resolution and quality of fetal ultrasound images, focusing Dual back-projection based internal learning (DBPISR) technique, which utilizes internal learning for blind super-resolution, as opposed to blind super-resolution generative adversarial network (BSRGAN), real-world enhanced super-resolution generative adversarial network (Real-ESRGAN), swin transformer for image restoration (SwinIR) and SwinIR-Large. The dual back-projection approach enhances SR by iteratively refining downscaling and super-resolution processes through a dual network training method, achieving high accuracy in kernel estimation and image reconstruction. Real-ESRGAN uses synthetic data to simulate complex real-world degradations, incorporating a U-shaped network (U-Net) discriminator to improve training stability and visual performance. BSRGAN addresses the limitations of traditional degradation models by introducing a realistic and comprehensive degradation process involving blur, downsampling, and noise, leading to superior real-world SR performance. Swin models (SwinIR and SwinIR_large) employ a Swin Transformer architecture for image restoration, excelling in capturing long-range dependencies and complex structures, resulting in an outstanding performance in PSNR, SSIM, NIQE, and BRISQUE metrics. The tested images, sourced from five developing countries and often of lower quality, enabled us to show that these approaches can help enhance the quality of the images. Evaluations on fetal ultrasound images reveal that these methods significantly enhance image quality, with DBPISR, Real-ESRGAN, BSRGAN, SwinIR, and SwinIR-Large showing notable improvements in PSNR and SSIM, thereby highlighting their potential for improving the resolution and diagnostic utility of fetal ultrasound images. We evaluated the five aforementioned Super-Resolution models, analyzing their impact on both image quality and classification tasks. Our findings indicate that these techniques hold great potential for enhancing the evaluation of medical images, particularly in development countries. Among the models tested, Real-ESRGAN consistently enhanced both image quality and diagnostic accuracy, even when challenged by limited and variable datasets. This finding was further supported by deploying the ConvNext-base classifier, which demonstrated improved performance when applied to the super-resolved images. Real-ESRGAN's capacity to enhance image quality, and in turn, classification accuracy, highlights its potential to address the resource constraints often encountered in these settings.",Lekadir K; El Habib Daho M,Univ Bretagne Occidentale; Artificial Intelligence in Medicine Lab (BCN-AIM),m.ammar@univ-boumerdes.dz.

The Committee on Conservative Management from the 7th International Consultation on Incontinence states that the benefit of adding biofeedback to PFMT is unclear. This review is an update of a Cochrane review last published in 2011. The primary objective was to assess the effects of PFMT with feedback or biofeedback, or both, for UI in women. We considered the following research questions. Are there differences in the effects of PFMT with feedback, biofeedback, or both versus PFMT without these adjuncts in the management of stress, urgency or mixed UI in women? Are there differences in the effects of feedback versus biofeedback as adjuncts to PFMT for women with UI? Are there differences in the effects of different types of biofeedback? We searched the Cochrane Incontinence Specialised Register (searched 27 September 2023), which includes searches of CENTRAL, MEDLINE, MEDLINE In-Process, MEDLINE Epub Ahead of Print, ClinicalTrials.gov, WHO ICTRP as well as handsearching of journals and conference proceedings, and the reference lists of relevant articles. We included only randomised controlled trials (RCTs), cluster-RCTs and quasi-RCTs in women with UI. We excluded studies that recruited women with neurological conditions, who were pregnant or less than six months postpartum. Eligible studies made one of the following comparisons: PFMT plus feedback versus PFMT alone, PFMT plus biofeedback versus PFMT alone, PFMT plus feedback or biofeedback versus PFMT alone, PFMT plus feedback versus PFMT plus biofeedback, and one type of biofeedback versus another. Two review authors independently assessed studies for eligibility, extracted data onto a prepiloted form, and assessed risk of bias using RoB 1. We used the GRADE approach to assess the certainty of evidence in each comparison by outcome. Our primary outcome was lower urinary tract symptom-specific quality of life. We pooled data using a standardised mean difference (SMD). Secondary outcomes were leakage episodes in 24 hours (mean difference (MD)), leakage severity (MD), subjective cure or improvement (odds ratio (OR)), satisfaction (OR), and adverse events (descriptive summary). We included 41 completed studies with 3483 women. Most (33 studies, 3031 women) investigated the effect of PFMT with biofeedback versus PFMT alone. Eleven studies were at low risk of bias overall, 27 at unclear risk of bias, and three at high risk. Only one study reported leakage severity, with no usable data. Comparison 1. PFMT with feedback versus PFMT alone: one eligible study reported no outcome of interest. Comparison 2. PFMT with biofeedback versus PFMT alone: there was little or no difference in incontinence quality of life (SMD 0.07 lower, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.18 lower to 0.05 higher; 11 studies, 1169 women; high-certainty evidence). Women randomised to biofeedback had 0.29 fewer leakage episodes in 24 hours versus PFMT alone (MD 0.29 lower, 95% CI 0.42 lower to 0.16 lower; 12 studies, 932 women; moderate-certainty evidence), but this slight reduction in leakage episodes may not be clinically important. Women in biofeedback arms report that there is probably little to no difference in cure or improvement (OR 1.26, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.58; 14 studies, 1383 women; moderate-certainty evidence) but may report greater satisfaction with treatment outcomes (OR 2.41, 95% CI 1.56 to 3.7; 6 studies, 390 women; low-certainty evidence). None of these outcomes were blinded. Eight studies (711 women) assessed severe adverse events but reported that there were no events. Comparison 3. PFMT with feedback or biofeedback versus PFMT alone: a single study contributed very-low certainty evidence regarding leakage episodes in 24 hours, subjective cure or improvement, and satisfaction. Comparison 4. PFMT with feedback versus PFMT with biofeedback: the evidence is very uncertain about any difference in effect between biofeedback versus feedback for incontinence-related quality of life. Not only is the evidence certainty very low, the confidence interval is very wide and there could be a more than small effect in favour of biofeedack or feedback (SMD 0.14 lower, 95% CI 0.56 lower to 0.28 higher; 2 studies, 91 women; very-low certainty evidence). There may be fewer leakage episodes in 24 hours for women receiving biofeedback verus feedback but the difference may not be clinically important and the evidence certainty is low (MD 0.28 lower, 95% CI 0.62 lower to 0.07 higher; 2 studies, 120 women; low-certainty evidence). There were no data for subjective cure, improvement or satisfaction. One study measured adverse events and none were reported. Comparison 5. PFMT with biofeedback versus PFMT with another type of biofeedback: five studies assessed this comparison, with individual studies contributing data for separate outcomes. There was low- or very-low certainty evidence about the benefits of one type of biofeedback versus another for leakage episodes in 24 hours or subjective cure or improvement, respectively. One study reported adverse events from two of nine women receiving electromyography biofeedback versus six of 10 receiving pressure biofeedback. PFMT with biofeedback results in little to no difference in incontinence quality of life. The addition of biofeedback to PFMT likely results in a small unimportant difference in leakage episodes in 24 hours, and likely little to no difference in patient-reported cure or improvement. Satisfaction may increase slightly for PFMT with biofeedback, based on low-certainty evidence. Five of the 33 studies in this comparison collected information about adverse events, and four reported none in either group. Adverse events reported by women using biofeedback seemed related to using a vaginal or rectal device (e.g. discomfort with device in place, vaginal discharge). The other comparisons had few, small studies, and low- to very low-certainty evidence for all outcomes. None of the studies reported any severe adverse events.",,,

Heart failure,10.1161/CIRCHEARTFAILURE.123.011381,"Despite favorable hemodynamic and neurohormonal effects, endothelin receptor antagonists have not improved outcomes in patients with heart failure (HF), possibly because they cause fluid retention. In this randomized, double-blind, multicenter trial (SERENADE [Macitentan in Heart Failure With Preserved Ejection Fraction and Pulmonary Vascular Disease]), we evaluated the effects of an endothelin receptor antagonist, macitentan, in patients with HF, left ventricular ejection fraction ≥40%, and pulmonary vascular disease. After a 4-week placebo run-in (to ensure clinical stability), followed by a 5-week single-blind macitentan run-in, patients who did not exhibit fluid retention were randomized to macitentan or placebo. The primary end point was change in NT-proBNP (N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide; baseline to 24 weeks); secondary end points included change in KCCQ (Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire) clinical summary score (baseline to 24 weeks) and time to worsening HF by 52 weeks. Of 230 patients enrolled, 28 were excluded during the placebo run-in, 60 excluded during the macitentan run-in, and 142 were randomized. Macitentan had no effect on change in NT-proBNP (geometric mean ratio [macitentan/placebo], 1.02 [90% CI, 0.88-1.19];  Despite a novel enrichment trial design to target pulmonary vascular disease and exclude treatment-related fluid retention in patients with HF and preserved/mildly reduced left ventricular ejection fraction, macitentan neither lowered NT-proBNP nor improved HF outcomes.

Ray tracing to determine power corrections.,2025-04-09,Ophthalmic & physiological optics : the journal of the British College of Ophthalmic Opticians (Optometrists),10.1111/opo.13477,"Part 1 of the study investigated image quality associated with oblique incidence of light on a multisegment lens (Hoya MiyoSmart) intended to treat myopia development. Part 2 investigates power corrections associated with oblique incidence. Modelling and ray tracing were carried out with lenses of -4 D distance power and, to a lesser extent, +0.25 D. Ray tracing simulations were done for the lens by itself, an eye model by itself and the combination. These simulations were for the static situation of peripheral vision when the eye looks through the lens centre and for central (foveal) vision when the eye rotates to look at objects away from the lens optical axis. The outcome was power correction of the optics, that is, the difference between the nominal power of the distance correction provided by the carrier lens under specific conditions and the actual power. This was determined across the field to about 45° and across the pupil for certain field angles. Most investigations were performed for distance vision, but some were for near objects with an accommodating version of the model eye. Ignoring intended multisegment effects, the quality of optics associated with peripheral vision was poor. There was considerable astigmatism (cylinder) across the field and high variation in astigmatism across the pupil. The added effects of the lens and eye were similar to those of their combination. For the accommodated eye model with an object at 250 mm, results were similar to those obtained with the unaccommodated model viewing a distant object. For foveal vision with the rotating eye, optics were relatively good with lower levels of astigmatism than for peripheral vision. The results of Part 1, finding considerable effects of the obliquity of incidence associated with peripheral vision and with foveal vision for the rotating eye, were supported by the power corrections.",,,
40060767,Recent regulatory developments in EU Medical Device Regulation and their impact on biomaterials translation.,,Bioengineering & translational medicine,10.1002/btm2.10721,"We envision this work to assist researchers and medical device developers (beside other stakeholders) to better understand biomaterial-based medical device development and its approval process proposed by the new MDR and IVDR in the European Union, as more complex biomaterials emerge, with the MDR reflecting the progress in biomaterial discoveries. Additionally, insufficient international harmonization in regulatory laws and poor-quality data reporting contribute to the problem. This review describes the possible reasons for a slowing biomaterials translational trend observed over the past decades, focusing on the European Market, and suggests a feasible approach for biomaterials-based medical device translation into the clinic. Suitable solutions to upgrade biomaterial translation to the clinic have not yet been provided by the field: no additional hurdles should be imposed for researchers, clinicians, the medical device industry, and insurance companies, which all should collaborate on bringing innovative solutions to patients. The new MDR and IVDR represent a substantial advancement in ensuring patient safety and reflect a major step forward in healthcare. However, they should not constrain innovation in biomaterials-based medical device development. Incorporating reverse engineering from patient safety and a 'safe by design' (SbD) strategy early into medical device development might lead to a smoother and successful approval process. A solid R&D phase, with an emphasis on device safety and performance assessment, is fundamental to ensure an effective transition into the clinic. We offer an overview of the recently implemented regulations on medical devices and in vitro diagnostics across the EU, describing a shifting paradigm in the field of biomaterials discovery. As more complex biomaterials emerge, suitable regulations will be necessary to keep bringing safe and well-performing medical solutions to patients.",,,

This study investigated key determinants of image quality in a multicenter cohort. This study analyzed fetal CMR scans from April 2021 to July 2023 at three centers (University Hospital Bonn, Children's Hospital Colorado, Phoenix Children's Hospital). Cine image quality was assessed using a 5-point Likert scale (1=non-diagnostic to 5=excellent) across three criteria as follows: contour sharpness, blood-to-structure contrast, and artifacts. Overall image quality scores were calculated by the average of all criteria. Apparent signal-to-noise (aSNR) and contrast-to-noise ratios (aCNR) were measured. Nine parameters were evaluated for their impact on image quality, namely: gestational age, body mass index (BMI), fetal motion, patient positioning, gating signal stability, breathing technique, field strength, slice thickness, and flip angle. Comparisons were conducted using the Mann-Whitney U test. A total of 98 scans were analyzed. Higher overall image quality, aSNR, and aCNR were observed in participants with BMI <30 kg/m², gestational age ≥32 weeks, low fetal motion severity, and stable gating signals (e.g., overall image quality for BMI <30 kg/m² vs ≥30 kg/m²: 4.4±0.7 vs. 4.1±0.7, p<0.001). Supine positioning resulted in better overall image quality compared to the left lateral position (4.5±0.5 vs. 4.2±0.8, p=0.001). Breath-holds provided similar overall image quality but improved contour sharpness and reduced artifacts compared to free breathing (5 [4,5] vs. 4 [4,5], p=0.042; and 4 [3-5] vs. 4 [3-5], p=0.014, respectively). At 1.5T field strength, higher contrast and fewer artifacts were observed compared to 3T (5 [4,5] vs. 5 [4,5], p=0.041; and 4 [4,5] vs. 4 [3-5], p=0.010, respectively). Slice thickness showed no significant impact on image quality. Various factors (e.g. BMI) influence fetal cardiac cine MRI image quality.

In recent years, nitric oxide (NO)-releasing technologies have been explored to mitigate bacterial infections, particularly those stemming from common gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial pathogens. However, NO-releasing materials do not inherently possess anti-fouling capabilities. Combination strategies that use NO and anti-fouling surfaces (e.g., slippery lubricant-infused porous surfaces) have been explored to compensate for the deficit. In this work, a novel material was developed and assessed that combines the antibacterial capabilities of a NO-releasing substrate with the anti-fouling effects of a nanoemulsion (NE)-infused slippery surface. Using a covalently bound NO donor (S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine, SNAP) to poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) and infused with a NE, denoted as SNAP-PDMS-NE, the NO release was sustained for 7 days. In addition to the prolonged NO release, the infused NE layer maintained a slippery nature and sliding angle below 20° for 7 days. The reported NO-releasing NE-swelled surface efficiently reduced Staphylococcus aureus adhesion by 3.5 log and Escherichia coli adhesion by 1.5 log after 24 h, reduced platelet adhesion by 89.92 %, and remained cytocompatible with relative cell viability greater than 70 %.",,,ejbrisbois@uga.edu.

Tactile feedback systems aim to improve sensations and rehabilitation by facilitating prosthesis utility and embodiment. The non-invasive vibrotactile feedback device Suralis® (Saphenus Medical Technology, Vienna, Austria) aims to improve gait, postural control, and pain treatment. This randomized controlled cross-over trial investigated 60-day effects of vibrotactile ground-contact feedback on gait performance and quality of life in adults with unilateral transtibial amputation without targeted reinnervation. We conducted gait assessments before and after the unblinded intervention period and compared within-period changes to the control period without intervention, separated by a one-week washout. The primary outcome substitute was affected-leg stance time, and secondary outcome measures included instrumented-walkway gait speed and four-square-step-test. The trial enrolled 18 participants during the COVID-19 pandemic and ended prematurely due to limitations in recruitment and integrity of the substituted primary outcome between-leg stance time difference. Five participants ended the study prematurely, the dropouts were unrelated to adverse events where one experienced concentration difficulties. Analyzing 13 participants showed that participants walking slower than 1.41 ms Despite the learning effects present, vibrotactile feedback had a small positive effect on functional balance and gait performance in slower-walking participants.

The study aimed to explore the longitudinal relationship between workers' disaster-related experiences and concern, and the impact of concern on depressive symptoms over three years. A total of 1347 workers from Fukushima Daiichi and Daini nuclear power plants participated. Three types of concern (work, life, or health-related) and depressive symptoms were assessed from 2012 to 2014 using self-reporting concern questionnaires and the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D). The relationships between disaster-related experiences and concern and depressive symptoms (CES-D score ≥16) were analyzed using mixed-effects models, as were the associations between type of concern and depressive symptoms. Stratified analyses for all associations were performed according to work location in 2011. Each type of concern was associated with different disaster-related experiences. Depressive symptoms were associated with job-related concern (β = 0.015, p < 0.011), life-related concern (β = 0.018, p = 0.002), and health-related concern (β = 0.018, p < 0.001), and these associations remained over two years. The associations were more evident in Daiichi plant workers, while Daini plant workers only exhibited significant associations with health-related concern. Different disaster-related experiences affected plant workers' concern. The risk of depressive symptoms was significant among workers with any of the three types of concern, particularly for Daiichi plant workers.

The study focuses on exploring the knowledge, perspectives, and experiences of healthcare professionals regarding IDDS as a treatment option for managing chronic refractory pain in cancer patients. A thematic coding using inductive analysis was employed to achieve the research objectives. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 18 healthcare professionals in various specialties, including oncology, neurosurgery, pain management, and palliative care. The interviews were transcribed, and a two-phased qualitative inductive coding approach was used to analyze the data. The findings of the study revealed four major themes: Education, Barriers & Benefits, Technical & Administrative, and Patient-Centered Care. The theme of Education highlighted the need for increased knowledge and awareness of IDDS among healthcare professionals. Barriers & Benefits encompassed concerns about infection risk, suitability for patients with a short life expectancy, and the challenges and advantages of IDDS use. The Technical & Administrative theme addressed cost considerations, device management, and the need for improved guidelines. Patient-Centered Care emphasized the importance of involving patients in decision-making and considering their physical and emotional well-being throughout the treatment pathway. This research identifies several areas of unmet need in the management of refractory pain in cancer patients, including the development of more inclusive guidelines, greater awareness among clinicians and patients, and the role of medical technology companies in supporting effective pain management.

In the clinical treatment of RA, the anti-rheumatoid drug sinomenine hydrochloride (SIN) was administered as tablets or injections. It has low oral bioavailability, dose-dependent adverse reactions, poor patient compliance with injections, and fails to resolve patients' early pain problems. We developed a bilayer polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP)/Phaseolus lunatusL. polysaccharide (PLP) microneedle (MN) to deliver SIN to inflammatory joints. The PVP layer rapidly dissolved and released SIN within 5 min of SIN@PLP MNs penetrating the skin; the PLP layer embedded in the skin functioned as a polymer carrier, releasing SIN continuously for up to 12 h; and 15 % PLP acted as a viscous backing to improve the efficacy of transdermal drug delivery. SIN@PLP MNs effectively inhibited the proliferation of fibroblast-like synoviocytes by scavenging reactive oxygen species (ROS), inhibiting the NF-κB and MAPK pathways, facilitating the polarization of macrophage phenotypes from M1 to M2, and reducing inflammatory cytokines. In an AIA rat model, SIN@PLP MNs reduced cartilage erosion and inflammatory pain. This natural multifunctional microneedle delivery system, which achieves immediate analgesia and sustained synergistic anti-inflammation, provides a novel approach to the safe and effective treatment of RA.",Chen N,Chengdu Jiuzhentang Health Management Limited Liability Company,bianjinhui@cdutcm.edu.cn.

Canonical p53 DNA damage response pathways are well characterized and classically thought to underlie the tumor suppressive effect of p53. Challenging this dogma, mouse models have revealed that p53-driven apoptosis and cell cycle arrest are dispensable for tumor suppression. Here, we investigated the inverse context of a p53 mutation predicted to drive the expression of canonical targets but is detected in human cancer. We established a novel mouse model with a single base pair mutation (GAG>GAT, p53E221D) in the DNA-Binding domain that has wild-type function in screening assays, but is paradoxically found in human cancer in Li-Fraumeni syndrome. Using mouse p53E221D and the analogous human p53E224D mutants, we evaluated expression, transcriptional activation, and tumor suppression in vitro and in vivo. Expression of human p53E224D from cDNA translated to a fully functional p53 protein. However, p53E221D/E221D RNA transcribed from the endogenous locus is mis-spliced resulting in nonsense-mediated decay. Moreover, fibroblasts derived from p53E221D/E221D mice do not express a detectable protein product. Mice homozygous for p53E221D exhibited increased tumor penetrance and decreased life expectancy compared to p53WT/WT animals. Mouse p53E221D and human p53E224D mutations lead to splice variation and a biologically relevant p53 loss of function in vitro and in vivo.",,,

Thirty-seven patients were included (PS group: twenty-one patients, PM group: sixteen patients), with follow-up periods ranging from six months to 23 years. MBL was measured using orthopantomograms (OPG), and implant success was evaluated using the Buser, Albrektsson, and Attia criteria. Regression analysis was conducted to assess total bone loss. The BEGO RI implant system was used in 83.8% of cases. Mesial MBL averaged 0.26 mm in the PS group and 0.75 mm in the PM group, while distal MBL was 0.68 mm for the PS group and 0.53 mm for the PM group. A significant difference was observed in mesial MBL, with the PS group showing less bone loss (p. = 0.044). Regression analysis indicated that PM implants were associated with significantly greater mesial bone loss compared to PS implants (p. = 0.039). No significant differences in implant success were observed between the PS and PM groups based on the Buser score, Albrektsson criteria, and Attia score. Both PS and PM implants showed comparable long-term functionality. No significant differences were found in total bone loss between the groups, but PS implants showed significantly lower mesial MBL.

Besides, NFIS can increase the interaction of antigens in a more dispersed manner with immune cell at local injection site, which may improve the immune responses of mRNA vaccines. Although SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines have great success, universal vaccines are urgently needed. Delivering universal mRNA vaccines by NFIS is preferred to combat COVID-19. RBD3-Fc mRNA expressing BA.4, Delta, and prototype RBD, and human IgG Fc with YTE mutation was designed and synthesized. The safety and immune responses of universal RBD3-Fc naked mRNA and mRNA-LNP vaccines delivered intradermally using NFIS (named GV-01) and intramuscularly via needles were evaluated and compared in rats. The prime-boost regimen administered by two routes resulted in potent immune responses and intradermal delivery displays comparable or better performance in terms of binding antibodies, neutralizing antibodies and T cell responses. Naked mRNA vaccines were functional, but less effective than mRNA-LNP vaccines. The above results suggest that RBD3-Fc vaccines are safe and immunogenic and NFIS can be used as an alternative to needles/syringes for the inoculation of mRNA-LNP vaccines to elicit robust systematic immune responses.",Zhang Y; Han B; Sun Y; Guo J,R&D Department,

This quality improvement project aimed to improve access to CGM in primary care for patients with type 2 diabetes on insulin. This was a quality improvement project conducted by a joint endocrinology/primary care team at a single primary care community health clinic. After defining the problem through process mapping, driver diagrams, and Pareto charts, several interventions were trialed through Plan-Do-Study-Act (PDSA) cycles. The study team consisted of four endocrinologists, two primary care providers (MD/NP), the lead primary care nurse, and the primary care population health specialist. Interventions included a directory for durable medical equipment (DME) suppliers, nursing education with device company representatives, a new electronic ordering system for DME, and a nursing outreach program to patients eligible for CGM. The primary outcome was percentage of eligible patients using CGM. Process measures included the number of CGM orders started weekly. Nursing comfort with CGM, knowledge of CGM, and perceptions of communication with DME suppliers were also measured. The percentage of eligible patients using CGM increased from 28 to 42%, and the percentage of patients using CGM started in primary care increased from 8 to 14%. Weekly orders increased from 0.3 per week to 2.3 per week. Nursing reported feeling more comfortable and knowledgeable about CGM after the interventions and reported improved communication with DME suppliers.

In this study, we fabricated drug-loaded poly(vinyl alcohol)/sodium sulfated alginate (PVA/SSA) nanofibrous mats incorporating cationic antibiotic drugs, i.e., salts of gentamicin, tetracycline, ciprofloxacin and minocycline, and examined their physicochemical and biological properties. The results of FTIR spectroscopy showed that cationic drugs have different interactions with carboxylate and sulfate functional groups of SSA depending on their chemical structure. Furthermore, the results of viscometry and conductivity analyses of the solutions revealed that the solutions with drugs with more electrical charge or/and higher functional groups resulted in a lower viscosity and conductivity compared to other drugs, due to the ability to form more hydrogen bonds. The release profiles of drug-loaded nanofibrous mats showed a burst release and then, a sustained release for 5 days, where the burst release of tetracycline (30.0 ± 0.3 %) from crosslinked mats was noticeably lower than other drugs.

Currently, there is sparse literature on the critical role that vascular surgeons serve in the delivery of this novel therapy. This single-institution series describes the creation of a BAT program and elaborates on the function of vascular surgeons in the multidisciplinary heart failure team. The preoperative evaluation, perioperative care, and postoperative course of patients receiving BAT from March 2022 to August 2023 were retrospectively analyzed. Eleven patients were evaluated by a dedicated heart failure cardiologist for medical eligibility and assessed by a vascular surgeon for technical feasibility. Of the 11 patients, 7 were men (63.6%). The median age was 60.5 years (range, 44-73 years). No patient (0.00%) had existing carotid artery disease, and one patient (9.1%) had undergone previous neck radiation therapy. All 11 patients (100%) had an existing cardiac implantable electronic device, and BAT implantation was performed on the same side as the cardiac implantable electronic device in two patients (18.1%). Four patients (36.4%) required preoperative hospital admission for medical optimization before surgery. The median length of surgery was 82 minutes (range, 58-113 minutes), and the median length of stay in the hospital after surgery was 1 day (range, 0-6 days). No major adverse neurologic or cardiovascular events, cranial nerve injuries, device complications requiring reintervention, or heart failure-related mortality at 6 months occurred. Three patients (27.3%) experienced extraneous stimulations, which affected BAT tolerability. Within 6 months after BAT implantation, no significant improvements were observed for several heart failure disease burden markers compared with 6 months before BAT implantation. Our early results demonstrate that BAT implantation is a safe procedure with rare complications. Vascular surgeons play an important role in the multidisciplinary delivery of this novel device-based therapy.

One of the techniques contributing to this success is data augmentation. The essence of data augmentation lies in synthesizing data while preserving accurate labels. In this research, we introduce a data augmentation technique optimized for electrocardiogram (ECG) data by focusing on the unique angles between precordial leads in 12-lead ECG, considering situations that may occur in a clinical environment. Subsequently, we utilize the proposed data augmentation technique to train a deep learning model for diagnosing atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter, generalized supraventricular tachycardia, first-degree atrioventricular block, left bundle branch block and myocardial infarction from ECG signals, and evaluate its performance to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Compared to other data augmentation methods, our approach demonstrated improved performance across various datasets and most tasks, thereby showcasing its potential to enhance diagnostic accuracy.

The purpose of this study was to describe the experience of employing a novel technique to create an intraoperatively handmade trileaflet pulmonary valve with glutaraldehyde-treated autologous pericardium (the AAA valve). This case series study was conducted from September 2018 to March 2021 at Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran. The surgical technique involved harvesting and treating with glutaraldehyde of the pericardium, constructing a trileaflet valve by encapsulating the pericardium within a Dacron tube with a diameter of 22 mm and a length of 20 mm, and implanting it into the pulmonary valve position. The AAA valve was constructed for 10 patients with a mean age of 16.20±5.81 years, seven of whom had undergone surgery for tetralogy of Fallot. The patients' mean follow-up length was 32.30±13.64 months. The AAA valve regurgitation was none to moderate. At the time of follow-up, all patients had AAA valve stenosis that was less than moderate, except for one case. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging and echocardiography results confirmed mild leaflet motion restriction in the patient with moderate stenosis. The anatomic valve parameters in MRI revealed a mean geometric height, coaptation height, and effective height of 20.23±2.40 mm, 10.42±1.67 mm, and 14.34±2.24 mm, respectively.

However, the robustness and clinical relevance of long-term data are often questionable. It is important to determine whether using long-term PROMs data justify the resources, costs, and difficulties associated with their collection. The aim of this study was to assess studies involving TKA and THA to determine which PROMs are most commonly reported, how complete PROMs data are at ≥ five years postoperatively, and the extent to which the scores change between early and long-term follow-up. We conducted a systematic review of the literature. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with sufficient reporting of PROMs were included. The mean difference in scores from the preoperative condition to early follow-up times (between one and two years), and from early to final follow-up, were calculated. The mean rates of change in the scores were calculated from representative studies. Meta-analyses were also performed on the most frequently reported PROMs. A total of 24 studies were assessed. The most frequently reported PROMs were the Oxford Knee Score (OKS) for TKA and the University of California, Los Angeles activity scale for THA. The mean rate of follow-up based on the number of patients available at final follow-up was 70.5% (39.2% to 91.0%) for knees and 82.1% (63.2% to 92.3%) for hips. The actual rates of collection of PROM scores were lower. For TKA, the mean OKS, Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC), and transformed WOMAC changes were -16.3 (95% CI -17.5 to -15.2), 23.2 (95% CI 17.2 to 29.2), and -29.7 (95% CI -32.4 to -27.0) points for short-term follow-up. These decreased to 1.3 (95% CI -0.8 to 3.3), -3.4 (95% CI -7.0 to 0.3), and 4.7 (95% CI -1.5 to 10.9) points for the remaining follow-up. A similar meta-analysis was not possible for studies involving THA. We commonly observed that the scores plateaued after between one and two years, and that there was little or no change beyond this time. The long-term PROMs for TKA and THA beyond one or two years are often incomplete and lose sensitivity at this time. Given the considerable resources, costs, and challenges associated with the collection of these scores, their clinical value is questionable. Therefore, consideration should be given to abandoning the requirement for the collection of long-term PROMs in favour of more robust and reliable measures of success that offer more clinical relevance and use.",Piuzzi NS,Department of Orthopedic Surgery,

Here, a new individualized approach to frequency band allocation was used. This approach is based on binaural perceptual pitch matching. The patient had congenital bilateral progressive sensorineural hearing loss due to Usher Syndrome. He had used hearing aids in both ears since the age of 4 years. In his mid-40s, he received a CI on his right ear and, ten months later, a second CI on the left ear. Adjustments to the frequency band allocations were made, guided by the binaural perceptual pitch matching of piano notes. For the first CI, pitch matching was performed using the contralateral ear as the reference, which had preserved low-frequency residual hearing (bimodal pitch matching). For the second CI, pitch matching was performed using the first implanted side as the reference (bilateral electrical pitch matching). The final frequency band allocation adjustments were always shifted toward lower frequencies relative to the default band allocations. The adjustments were larger in magnitude for the second CI compared to the first CI. Speech perception scores generally increased over the course of rehabilitation and were higher with the individualized fitting compared to the default fitting. The subjective sound quality was reportedly greatly improved with the individualized fitting. Individualized psychoacoustic frequency-based fitting can yield improvements in the perceived sound quality with a CI. However, this method requires significant residual hearing in at least one ear, and the patient must have relatively fine pitch discrimination abilities.",Lippl L,MED-EL Deutschland GmbH,tobias.rader@med.uni-muenchen.de.

We compared a new AI solution, validated on a separate dataset from different UK hospitals, to the original multidisciplinary team (MDT)-supported radiologist's interpretations. A Conformité Européenne (CE)-marked deep-learning (DL) computer-aided detection (CAD) medical device (Pi) was trained to detect Gleason Grade Group (GG) ≥ 2 cancer using retrospective data from the PROSTATEx dataset and five UK hospitals (793 patients). Our separate validation dataset was on six machines from two manufacturers across six sites (252 patients).

Among these, lactate concentration serves as a significant indicator of human physiological states. In this study, we present an innovative self-powered wearable electrochemical sensor designed for real-time lactate detection in human sweat. This sensor utilizes a composite conductive hydrogel medium, showcasing its potential in monitoring and assessing human health. The sensor incorporates two key components: the lactate oxidase/reduced graphene oxide/carbon cloth electrode (LOx/rGO/CCE) as the anode and the bilirubin oxidase/reduced graphene oxide/carbon cloth electrode (BOx/rGO/CCE) as the cathode. These electrodes are integrated into a substrate comprising a conductive hydrogel composed of Poly (3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS) and hydrophilic polyurethane (HPU). The sensor's performance was evaluated. The linear detection range spans from 10 nM to 50 mM, with an impressive detection limit of 4.38 nM, demonstrating its high sensitivity and selectivity towards lactate detection with long-term stability. Additionally, this sensor has been successfully applied to real-time monitor lactate concentration on athletes' skin by combining it with self-made equipment and smartphones. The test results demonstrate minimal error compared to the results obtained from high-performance liquid chromatography.

In preclinical studies, the use of SKINHEALTEX PLGA, an electrospun poly(lactic-co-glycolide) acid (PLGA) bioveil, placed between autografts and their bed has shown potential to stimulate dermal regeneration, increase graft take and improve scar quality. These properties have not yet been evaluated in human clinical trials. The primary goal of this study was to evaluate tolerability and safety of SKINHEALTEX PLGA on human tissues, specifically, split-thickness skin autografts and wound beds of debrided burns. A double-blind randomised controlled clinical trial was conducted with adult patients with deep burns requiring surgical treatment, for 4 years (November 2018 to September 2022). Each patient acted as their own control, and they were followed for 12 months. In the control area a skin autograft was applied, while in the treatment area SKINHEALTEX PLGA was interposed between the autograft and the bed. The outcome variables were incidence of adverse events, the percentage of graft take (evaluated clinically), and Vancouver Scar Scale and Patient and Observer Scar Assesment Scale scores. The bioveil was well tolerated in the 26 patients that were recruited. No adverse events related to SKINHEALTEX PLGA were observed. No statistically significant differences were observed in split-thickness skin autograft take and subsequent scar quality between the control group (split-thickness skin autografts alone) and the autograft and SKINHEALTEX PLGA group. This is the first clinical trial investigating the application of an electrospun biomaterial in the treatment of burns using skin autografts. SKINHEALTEX PLGA is a biocompatible and safe product that can be applied as an interface between autografts and the debrided bed of a burn without reducing graft take. Further research is needed to assess the value of SKINHEALTEX PLGA for burn wounds and its potential as an administration route of molecules than enhance dermal regeneration in burn patients.",Blanes M; Marco B,Instituto Tecnológico Textil Aitex,nvanaclocha@hotmail.com.

Long-term data in routine clinical practice are needed. Patients with AF receiving edoxaban at baseline continue to have low annualized effectiveness and safety event rates in the second year of follow-up, with regional variations observed. The Global ETNA-AF program is a prospective, noninterventional study of patients with AF receiving edoxaban. Patient characteristics and annualized clinical event rates were assessed overall and by region across the 2-year follow-up. Annualized event rates of bleeding and thromboembolic events were assessed within the first year and conditionally in patients who were event-free up to 12 months in the second year. This analysis comprised 26 805 patients from Europe (n = 13 164), Japan (n = 10 342), and non-Japanese Asian regions (n = 3299). Patients from Europe had the highest burden of comorbidities. The annualized event rates for major bleeding, any stroke, all-cause death, and cardiovascular death varied by region.

In this context, advances in medical and technological sciences offer tools and options with the aim of improving the quality of life of animals with locomotor problems. This case report aims to describe the custom development of a 3D exoprosthesis for a dog with an amputated hind limb. A female dog, mixed breed, approximately 5 years old, was admitted to the Veterinary Clinic of the Centro Universitário de João Pessoa-Brazil, with locomotor problems due to low amputation of the left hind limb, without pain or sensitivity to touch on the amputated stump. Measurements of the amputated limb were collected to create a virtual model of the 3D exoprosthesis in a socket model. After simulations and tests, the prosthesis was materialized by 3D printing in collaboration with the Brazilian company 3D Medicine©, using polylactic acid (PLA) as the main material, an organic, lightweight, and resistant synthetic thermoplastic. The exoprosthesis was covered with protective material and fixed to the animal with a compressive bandage. Immediately after fixation, the animal demonstrated support of the limb on the prosthesis while standing, better distribution of body weight and relief of load on the contralateral limb. The increase in the time of use of the prosthesis was gradual and under supervision, after four weeks the dog did not present major difficulties in walking, running, and eating, in addition, no injuries to the amputated stump were observed. Veterinary physiotherapeutic follow-up was recommended. This case report describes the development of a 3D exoprosthesis for dogs as a cost-effective option to reduce the locomotor impacts of limb amputation and improve quality of life. Techniques using additive manufacturing and 3D technology have immense potential for medical application, especially in veterinary medicine due to the difference in anatomical and body structure between domestic and wild animals.",,,lucas.carvalho@ki.se.

However, in developing countries, logistical and infrastructural challenges often result in delays, particularly in suburban areas. This study evaluates the feasibility and safety of using drones to deliver AEDs in suburban OHCA scenarios. A series of ninety test flights were conducted using a DJI Matrice 600 drone (DJI, China) to deliver a Philips HeartStart AED (Philips, Netherlands) across varying payloads. Bystanders in simulated OHCA situations identified their location via mobile applications, enabling the drone operator to dispatch the drone beyond the pilot's line of sight. The results showed a 97.7% success rate in AED delivery, with a median flight distance of 4042 m and a median response time of 7 min and 39 s. Despite payload variations, the drone maintained adequate speed and landing accuracy, with a mean speed of 9.17 m per second and a median landing error of 122 centimeters.

However, the PEMF effect on modulating microbial diversity has not been explored. Thus, we tested a miniaturized PEMF biomedical device as a healing component for dental implants. PEMF activation did not alter the chemical composition, surface roughness, wettability, and electrochemical performance. PEMF effectively controlled chronic in vitro polymicrobial microbial accumulation. The in vivo study where devices were inserted in the patients' oral cavities and 16S RNA sequencing analysis evidenced a fivefold or more reduction in 23 bacterial species for PEMF group and the absence of some species for this group, including pathogens associated with implant-related infections.

Because studies of the injectable hyaluronic acid gel VYC-25L (Allergan Aesthetics, an AbbVie Company, Irvine, CA) contained few Asian subjects and none from China, its effects on chin retrusion in Chinese individuals are unclear. This 12-month, real-world evidence study evaluated the safety and effectiveness of VYC-25L for chin enhancement in Chinese adults. At Hainan Bo'ao Super Hospital, 2 cohorts of prospectively and retrospectively enrolled adults received VYC-25L treatment (maximum 4 mL). Cohort 1 only underwent 3D imaging before and after treatment for digital analysis. The primary effectiveness measure was mean change from baseline in glabella-subnasale-pogonion (G-Sn-Pog) angle at month 3 based on 3D facial images. Both cohorts completed the Global Aesthetic Improvement Scale (GAIS; subjects and investigators) and a satisfaction questionnaire (subjects). Injection site response (ISR) and adverse events were recorded. Of 90 subjects enrolled (cohort 1, n=36; cohort 2, n=54), 89 completed the study. Mean change from baseline in G-Sn-Pog angle at month 3 was 3.19 degrees (95% CI, 2.55-3.83; P < 0.001 vs 0), with improvement maintained through 12 months.

In recent years, robotic guidance has been used to increase the precision, accuracy, and overall patient safety of spinal column fixation via screw placement. Within this context, the present study aims to quantify and classify complications of spinal robotic devices using a nationally representative database. The Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) was queried for adverse events involving the most widely used spinal robotic devices from inception to November 3rd, 2023. Entries were tabulated by assigning categorical variables based on event information. The query yielded 339 unique robotic failure events. The most frequent complications in robotic-assisted spinal surgeries were imprecision (73.6%), software errors (13.7%), and damaged or missing screws (4.9%). Most reported events occurred intraoperatively after the initial incision (78.5%) [compared to preoperatively or postoperatively]. The Mazor X™ system was the most represented spinal robotic platform in terms of complications, accounting for 71.6% of reported robotic failure events. Most reported errors were resolved intraoperatively or continued through the employment of alternative imaging methods and, overall, had minimal clinical significance. With respect to robot-assisted pedicle screw placement, medial breaches were 1.7x more common than lateral breaches across all robotic systems. Finally, regarding the impact of device failures on perioperative timing, we found that 10.3% of adverse events resulted in delays greater than 1 h. Ultimately, imprecision and unresponsive software were found to be two of the most frequent complications of robot-assisted spine surgery. Though most reported errors were circumvented intraoperatively through conventional, non-robotic imaging/guidance methods, 10.3% of adverse events resulted in procedural delays of greater than 1 h.",Pennington Z,Department of Neurologic Surgery,nolanbrown95@proton.me.

Climate change, biodiversity loss, and pollution negatively impact all life on earth. All populations are impacted but not equally; the most vulnerable are at the highest risk, an inequity further exacerbated by differences in access to healthcare globally. The delivery of healthcare exacerbates the planetary health crisis through greenhouse gas emissions, largely due to combustion of fossil fuels for medical equipment production and operation, creation of medical and non-medical waste, and contamination of water supplies. As representatives of radiology societies from across the globe who work closely with industry, and both governmental and non-governmental leaders in multiple capacities, we advocate together for urgent, impactful, and measurable changes to the way we deliver care by further engaging our members, policymakers, industry partners, and our patients. Simultaneous challenges, including global health disparities, resource allocation, and access to care, must inform these efforts. Climate literacy should be increasingly added to radiology training programs. More research is required to understand and measure the environmental impact of radiological services and inform mitigation, adaptation and monitoring efforts. Deeper collaboration with industry partners is necessary to support innovations in the supply chain, energy utilization, and circular economy. Many solutions have been proposed and are already available, but we must understand and address barriers to the implementation of current and future sustainable innovations. Finally, there is a compelling need to partner with patients, to ensure that trust in the excellence of clinical care is maintained during the transition to sustainable radiology. By fostering a culture of global cooperation and rapid sharing of solutions amongst the broader imaging community, we can transform radiological practice to mitigate its environmental impact, adapt and develop resilience to current and future climate and environmental threats, and simultaneously improve access to care.

However, existing published evidence for the effectiveness and safety of BET remains unclear. To evaluate the effects of balloon dilatation of the Eustachian tube in adults with obstructive Eustachian tube dysfunction. The Cochrane ENT Information Specialist searched the Cochrane ENT Register; Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); Ovid M>DLINE; Ovid Embase; Web of Science; Clinicaltrials.gov; ICTRP and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The final search was updated on 18th January 2024. There were no restrictions on language, publication date or study setting. Randomised controlled trials were included if they allocated adult participants with chronic obstructive ETD to treatment randomly and compared BET with non-surgical treatment, no treatment, or other surgical treatment. Studies with other designs were excluded. At least two review authors independently selected trials using predetermined inclusion criteria, assessed the risk of bias, extracted data, and rated the certainty of evidence (CoE) according to GRADEpro. Statistical analyses were performed using a random-effects model and interpreted according to the most recent version of the Cochrane Handbook. Predefined primary outcomes were obstructive ETD symptoms, Eustachian tube function (objective or semi-objective tests), or serious adverse events. Secondary outcomes were hearing, tympanic membrane abnormalities, quality of life, and other adverse events. Nine trials were identified with 684 randomised participants across three comparisons: BET versus non-surgical treatment (five trials, 422 participants), BET versus no treatment (sham surgery; one trial, 17 participants), and BET versus other surgery (four trials, 275 participants). None of the studies were rated with an overall low risk of bias. Comparing BET to non-surgical treatment up to three months, there is low-certainty evidence showing that BET may reduce patient-reported ETD symptoms (change in ETDQ-7: mean difference (MD) -1.66 (95% CI -2.16 to -1.16; I BET may lead to a clinically meaningful improvement in ETD symptoms compared to non-surgical or no treatment (in the form of sham surgery) at up to three months. The effects of BET on ETD compared to non-surgical treatment are very uncertain beyond three months. However, the certainty of evidence ranged from low to very low, with the studies being underpowered to detect adverse events. The findings of this review should help to inform further BET research and guidelines. Future research should focus on longer-term outcomes and the incidence of adverse events or complications in real-world practice settings.",Patel A,Department of ENT Surgery,

All populations are impacted but not equally; the most vulnerable are at highest risk, an inequity further exacerbated by differences in access to healthcare globally.The delivery of healthcare exacerbates the planetary health crisis through greenhouse gas emissions, largely due to combustion of fossil fuels for medical equipment production and operation, creation of medical and non-medical waste, and contamination of water supplies.As representatives of radiology societies from across the globe who work closely with industry, and both governmental and non-governmental leaders in multiple capacities, we advocate together for urgent, impactful, and measurable changes to the way we deliver care by further engaging our members, policymakers, industry partners, and our patients. Simultaneous challenges including global health disparities, resource allocation, and access to care must inform these efforts.Climate literacy should be increasingly added to radiology training programmes. More research is required to understand and measure the environmental impact of radiological services and inform mitigation, adaptation and monitoring efforts. Deeper collaboration with industry partners is necessary to support innovations in the supply chain, energy utilization, and circular economy. Many solutions have been proposed and are already available, but we must understand and address barriers to implementation of current and future sustainable innovations. Finally, there is a compelling need to partner with patients, to ensure that trust in the excellence of clinical care is maintained during the transition to sustainable radiology.By fostering a culture of global cooperation and rapid sharing of solutions amongst the broader imaging community, we can transform radiological practice to mitigate its environmental impact, adapt and develop resilience to current and future climate and environmental threats, and simultaneously improve access to care.",Allen B; Fletcher J; Gerson RF; Ho ELM,Northwest Radiologists; ParkCity Medical Centre; President International Society of Radiology - Reston; Monash Health,

Traditional antiviral therapies in the form of tablets or capsules often face limitations in terms of therapeutic activity, systemic side effects, and delayed onset of action. Dry powder inhalers (DPIs) provide a targeted delivery system, ensuring the direct administration of antivirals to the infection site, the respiratory tract, which potentially enhance therapeutic efficacy and minimize systemic exposure. This review explores the current state of inhaled dry powder antiviral agents, their advantages over traditional routes, and specific formulations under development. We discuss the benefits of targeted delivery, such as improved drug deposition in the lungs and reduced side effects, alongside considerations related to the formulation preparation. In addition, we summarize the developed (published and marketed) inhaled dry powders of antiviral agents.",Saha T,International Centre for Diarrheal Disease Research,

By integrating a micro-tapered fiber into a single tapered fiber structure, the design enhances sensitivity, signal-to-noise ratio, and resolution capability, while reducing the length of the sensing fiber. Through simulation analysis, it was found that the tapered-in-tapered fiber significantly improved the refractive index detection sensitivity by exciting a stronger evanescent field effect. The experimental comparison between the tapered-in-tapered fiber and traditional tapered fiber showed a 1.7-fold increase in sensitivity, reaching 3266.78 nm/RIU within the refractive index range of 1.3326 to 1.3414. Furthermore, to expand its application prospects in the biomedical field, glutaraldehyde cross-linking technology was used to immobilize C-reactive protein (CRP) antibodies on the surface of the tapered-in-tapered fiber, successfully creating a biosensing platform for the specific recognition of CRP. The experimental results demonstrate that this novel biosensor can rapidly and accurately detect CRP molecules at different concentrations with a detection limit of 0.278 μg/mL, and that it exhibits good selectivity and repeatability. This tapered-in-tapered fiber-optic biosensor provides new insights into the development of high-performance fiber-optic immunosensors and shows broad application potential in immunology research and early disease diagnosis.",,,

One mitigation strategy is to develop models that can predict cognitive performance by tracking physiological metrics associated with cold stress. As females are evidenced to be more sensitive to cold exposure, this study investigated the relationship between physiological metrics and cognitive performance deterioration of female subjects under cold stress. Wearable electrodermal activity (EDA) and electrocardiogram (ECG) were collected from nineteen females who underwent five sessions of a cognitive task battery-assessing reaction time, memory, and attention-in a cold (10 °C) environment. Machine learning classifiers showed higher cognitive performance classification accuracies with heart rate variability (HRV) features than with EDA features. Particularly in detecting performance deterioration in a task associated with assessing short-term memory, our support vector machine classifier with HRV features showed an 82.4% accuracy, with a sensitivity of 84.2% and a specificity of 80.6%, whereas a 55.4% accuracy with a sensitivity of 44.7% and a specificity of 66.7% was obtained with EDA features.

However, there is no established criterion to verify the minimum qualification to select one from numerous candidates, especially for SHEDs' cultured FBS-free medium for clinic application. For that, we performed a characteristic analysis containing the growth rate, colony-forming unit (CFU) number, average colony size, and migration capacity with hPL-cultured SHEDs from 21 different donors, and we suggest the result as a minimum standard to filter out unqualified candidates. In addition, in the secretome analysis to predict the paracrine effect, it was found that upregulated proteins compared to the control were related to angiogenesis, immune response, and BMP signaling, and this was found to have a strong correlation only with protein concentration. This study presents a minimum standard for selecting cell therapy candidates and suggests the protein concentration of a conditioned medium as a cost-effective tool to expect the paracrine effect of SHEDs.",,,

Some published optical treatments of these lenses assume normal incidence of light at the surfaces, but images falling on the peripheral retina are usually associated with oblique ray pencils. Here, we model representative images of point objects produced by the Hoya MiyoSmart MS spectacle lens when oblique ray pencils are used. Various imaging aspects of the MS lens alone and in combination with a suitable accommodating eye model for a 4D myope were evaluated using the Optical Design program Ansys Zemax OpticStudio. Configurations studied included object points at vergences of zero and -4 D, with the objects being either on the lens axis or at a field angle of about 30°. The effect on foveal vision of rotating the axis of the eye with respect to that of the lens was also considered. Images of point objects were described in terms of spot diagrams and fast Fourier transform point-spread functions. Symmetry and overall optical quality of images decreased with the obliquity of the ray pencils, due to the increased off-axis aberrations of the lens and the eye. Images of near object points were strongly affected by the level of accommodation: optimal retinal image quality occurred when accommodation brought the carrier lens focus close to the retina, rather than that of the lenslets. Attempts to understand why MS lenses slow myopia progression need to consider the way in which through-focus retinal image quality changes with obliquity of the ray pencils across the visual field and the possible effects of ocular accommodation.",,,

The degree of neonatal activity is associated with under and over-sedation and may also indicate the onset of disease. Activity may also cause motion noise on physiological signals leading to false readings of important parameters such as heart rate, respiratory rate or oxygen saturation or, in extreme cases, a failure to calculate the parameter at all. Here we report on a novel neonatal activity monitoring technology we have developed using a Random Forest machine learning algorithm trained on features extracted from a depth video stream from a commercially available depth sensing camera. A cohort of twenty neonates took part in the study where depth information was acquired from various camera locations above and to the side of each neonate. Depth data were processed to provide features indicating changes corresponding to the activity of the neonate and then input into a Random Forest model which was trained and tested using a leave-one-out cross validation paradigm. Applying the thresholds found in training the Random Forest model during testing with leave-one-out cross validation, the mean (standard deviation) of the sensitivity and specificity of the optimal points and the corresponding area under the receiver operator curve (ROC-AUC) were 92.0% (8.8%), 93.2% (11.1%) and 97.7% (2.5%) respectively.

Invasive hemodynamic monitoring methods represented by the thermodilution method are limited in their clinical application scope because they require vascular cannulation. Non-invasive hemodynamic monitoring has attracted extensive attention from medical companies and clinicians at home and abroad in recent years due to its advantages such as safety, non-invasiveness, continuous monitoring, simple operation, and low cost. This paper designs a non-invasive hemodynamic monitoring system based on the impedance cardiography, including hardware, algorithm, software design, and performance parameter evaluation. Among them, the hardware part mainly includes a differential high-frequency constant current source stimulation circuit, impedance cardiogram signal acquisition, and ECG signal acquisition circuit. Signal processing includes wave filtering, impedance cardiogram signal calibration, and ECG signal and impedance cardiogram signal feature point recognition. According to the collected impedance cardiogram and ECG signals, hemodynamic parameters such as heart rate (HR), stroke volume (SV), cardiac output (CO), stroke index (SI), cardiac index (CI), and cardiac contractility index (ICON) are calculated based on the Nyboer thoracic cylinder model. After testing, the key technical indicators of the system hardware are better than that of the relevant medical device standards. The system was used to collect impedance cardiogram and ECG signal data from 40 volunteers.

Since routing policies directly influence data transmission paths, routing optimization serves as an effective strategy for improving network performance by mitigating transmission risks and threats. This paper introduces an Intelligent Tuning Method for Service Scheduling in Electric Power Communication Networks Based on Operational Risk and Quality of Service (QoS) Guarantee. Based on a comprehensive assessment of service transmission reliability and time costs, a route satisfaction evaluation function model has been developed. Utilizing this model, an enhanced Risk-Time Ant Colony Optimization (RT-ACO) routing algorithm is proposed, which builds upon the traditional ant colony algorithm. The improvements to the ant colony algorithm are made in four key areas: the definition of heuristic information, the weighting of parameters, the state selection strategy, and the pheromone update strategy. These enhancements aim to achieve optimal routing scheduling based on risk information. At the same time, a reconfiguration algorithm for power optical communication networks, based on service priority, is proposed for specific service requests. This algorithm provides both a primary routing path and an alternate routing path for service transmission, ensuring the delivery of high-priority services even when both the primary and standby paths are unavailable. Simulation results from an actual power business communication network demonstrate that the algorithm outputs the main and alternate paths with the lowest risk costs. Additionally, the path satisfaction of the proposed algorithm is improved by 7.4% compared to the traditional ant colony algorithm. This improvement validates the accuracy and superiority of the proposed algorithm and offers a valuable reference for ensuring the reliable operation of power optical fiber communication network systems.",Yu Y; Dou Z; Cong L; Huang W; Zhang Q; Hu Y; Bi Y,The State Grid Jilin Province Electric Power Company Limited Information Communication Company; State Grid Changchun Electric Power Supply Company,

Participants were randomized to eight days of either PSWT with a single functioning device (SofPulse, Endonovo Therapeutics, Woodland Hills, CA) or a sham device placed over the surgical bandages in a participant- and assessor-masked fashion. The primary end point was the sum of the average and worst (maximum) daily pain intensity as measured with the numeric rating scale collected over the first seven postoperative days. No systemic side effects or significant complications occurred. During the first seven postoperative days, the sum of the daily pain intensity scores in the active group was a mean (SD) of 28 (11) vs 34 (14) in sham: difference -6.5 (95% CI, -12.4 to -0.6), p = 0.032.

Here, we aimed to develop hydrogels that mirror the villi and crypts of the small intestine and exhibit a physiological stiffness of G' ~ 1.52 kPa. For this purpose, we developed gelatin-methacryloyl-aminoethyl-methacrylate (gel-MA-AEMA)-, and gelatin-methacryloyl-norbornene (gel-MA-NB)-based biomaterial inks to fabricate 3D hydrogels (""villi only"" versus ""crypts and villi"") with digital light processing (DLP) and co-cultured Caco-2/HT29-MTX cells. Gel-MA-AEMA was selected for its higher amount of methacrylates which was hypothesized to provide superior photo-crosslinking kinetics and hence superior DLP fabrication potential while gel-MA-NB was evaluated for its selective functionalization potential with thiolated bioactive compounds following DLP processing, resulting from its incorporated NB moieties which remain unreacted during the DLP process. Both gel-MA-AEMA-, and gel-MA-NB-based hydrogels exhibited a physiologically relevant stiffness, but only the gel-MA-AEMA-based biomaterial ink could be successfully utilized for printing hydrogels encompassing villi and crypts. Paracellular permeability of small sized marker molecules in combination with transepithelial electrical resistance measurements showed the formation of a functional barrier over time on all hydrogel constructs. Transmission electron microscopy and enterocyte differentiation marker genes' expression levels revealed the superior differentiation of Caco-2 on the 3D constructs compared to 2D hydrogel sheets. In summary, while both hydrogels enhanced functional barrier formation and enterocyte differentiation, gel-MA-AEMA proved more conducive to DLP compared to gel-MA-NB.

39977403,Active power filter control strategy based on repetitive quasi-proportional resonant control with linear active disturbance rejection control.,2025-05-09,PloS one,10.1371/journal.pone.0318558,"Active power filter (APF) is a new type of harmonic mitigation device, and its harmonic mitigation capability mainly depends on the control strategies of current inner loop and voltage outer loop. Traditional proportional integral (PI) control methods cannot track harmonic currents without steady-state error, thereby it leads to the poor tracking accuracy of the harmonic current and is difficult to achieve high-performance harmonic compensation. Thus, in this paper, a repetitive quasi-proportional resonant (QPR) with linear active disturbance rejection control (LADRC) is proposed. Firstly, QPR control is introduced to replace PI control. QPR control can eliminate steady-state error and realize no static error tracking of harmonic current. Meanwhile, QPR control can coordinate control of various frequency components and enhance APF's ability to suppress specific harmonics. Then, the introduction of repetitive control optimizes the QPR control, so that the dynamic performance of the system does not change while further improving the tracking accuracy of the APF system for harmonic current. Finally, LADRC control is used to observe and compensate for the coupled parts of the system. Thereby, it can achieve high-performance decoupling without adding additional sensors. In addition, in order to ensure the stability of the DC-side voltage and enhance its dynamic performance, this paper also designs a voltage outer loop controlled by QPR. The proposed method is verified by real-time digital simulation system (RTDS). The simulation results show that compared with the double closed-loop PI control, the repetitive quasi-proportional resonant with linear active disturbance rejection control (repetitive QPR-LADRC) and QPR double closed-loop control proposed in this paper can not only increase the harmonic current tracking accuracy of APF system, but also improve the dynamic performance of APF system and significantly enhance the harmonic suppression ability of APF.",Wei H; Lv X,Research and Development Department,

This study quantitatively investigates eccrine sweat as a significant channel for loss of amino acids during exercise, to improve an understanding of amino acid turnover and to provide feedback to users on the need for supplement intake. The measurement platform consists of a soft, skin-interfaced microfluidic system for real-time analysis of amino acid content in eccrine sweat. This system relies on integrated fluorometric assays and smartphone-based imaging techniques for quantitative analysis, as a simple, cost-effective approach that does not require electrochemical sensors, electronics or batteries. Human subject studies reveal substantial amino acid losses in sweat from working muscle regions during prolonged physical activities, thereby motivating the need for dietary supplementation. The findings suggest potential applications in healthcare, particularly in athletic and clinical settings, where maintaining amino acid balance is critical for ensuring proper homeostasis.",,,jrogers@northwestern.edu.

CSAI was initiated with a 1-2 mg bolus followed by 1 mg/h infusion titrated to optimal efficacy and tolerability. Following titration, patients entered a 52-week maintenance period.ResultsOf 99 patients treated, 85 completed the titration period, 69 completed maintenance week 12 and 48 completed maintenance week 52. Common treatment-related adverse events included infusion site nodules and erythema, dyskinesia, nausea, and somnolence, each of which occurred more frequently during the titration period. Reduction in OFF time began at CSAI initiation and reached a mean of 3.0 ± 3.18 h/day by maintenance week 12 (primary efficacy endpoint), with a corresponding increase in Good ON time of 3.1 ± 3.35 h/day. By maintenance week 12, 68% of patients rated themselves as much or very much improved, 62% had at least a 2-h reduction in daily OFF time, and mean concomitant oral levodopa and levodopa equivalent doses (excluding CSAI) had been reduced by 198 mg/day and 283 mg/day, respectively. Improvements were maintained through week 52.ConclusionsThis study supports the clinical utility of CSAI to reduce OFF time and increase Good ON time in patients with motor fluctuations inadequately controlled with oral therapy. Continuous subcutaneous apomorphine infusion (also called CSAI) is a treatment to control OFF time (periods of poor motor control) that occurs despite ongoing use of usual Parkinson disease medications like levodopa. Apomorphine is slowly infused under the skin using a thin, flexible tube connected to a small, wearable infusion device. CSAI therapy has been widely used outside the United States for its effective control of Parkinson disease symptoms since the mid 1980s. In order to gain approval for CSAI use in the United States, a specific study conducted in United States clinics and hospitals was required. In this study, people with Parkinson disease experiencing 3 or more hours of OFF time per day were started on apomorphine infusion (CSAI) therapy. The dose of apomorphine was increased until each study participant experienced the best possible benefit while still tolerating the medication. Once this dose was identified, participants continued on this dose. The most common side effects were nodules (small bumps under the skin) and erythema (redness of the skin) at the infusion site, dyskinesia (involuntary movements), nausea, and somnolence (sleepiness). These side effects were more frequently experienced at the start of treatment when the best dose of CSAI for each participant was being identified and the participant's other PD medications were being adjusted. Soon after they started CSAI treatment, participants noticed a reduction in the amount of OFF time that they experienced each day. After 12 weeks at a stable dose of CSAI treatment, participants' OFF time had decreased by about 3 hours per day on average. At the same time, most (68%) participants said they felt their symptom control was “much improved“ or “very much improved” compared to before starting CSAI therapy. Importantly, these improvements were maintained throughout one year of treatment. These findings support the use of apomorphine infusion in the United States as an effective and safe treatment option for people with Parkinson disease that does not require surgery.",Qin P; Formella AE; Ceresoli-Borroni G; ,; Department of Research & Development,
39972937,Vascular Microphysiological System for Investigating Endothelial Barrier Function During Organ Preservation and Reperfusion.,2025-05-09,"Small (Weinheim an der Bergstrasse, Germany)",10.1002/smll.202410168,"Endothelial cell damage after cold preservation and reperfusion injury causes deterioration of the endothelial barrier and ultimately results in edema, leading to transplant failure. Here, a vascular microphysiological system (MPS) is introduced as a testbed to investigate the combinational effect of thermal and fluid perturbations (i.e., wall shear stress) on human endothelial barrier function. Two methods of organ storage are compared: isochoric supercooling (ISC) preservation, which prevents ice formation at subzero temperatures; and, the standard clinical protocol of static cold storage (SCS) at 4 °C. Integrating electrical impedance measurements on chip allow real-time monitoring and quantification of barrier function during preservation and reperfusion protocols. Isochoric supercooling preservation enables longer periods of preservation with superior recovery of barrier function during reperfusion, and has lower metabolic activities compared to static cold storage. Genomic analysis reveals injury and recovery mechanisms at the molecular level for the different preservation and reperfusion conditions. The multifunctional vascular microphysiological system provides a physiologically relevant in vitro model recapitulating ischemia-reperfusion injury to the endothelium. The vascular MPS has potential for optimizing organ preservation protocols, ultimately improving organ transplant viability.",,,

However, more than five decades later, evidence supporting the evidence of intrapartum CTG in preventing neonatal and long-term childhood morbidity and mortality remains inconclusive. At the same time, shortcomings in CTG interpretation have been recognised as important contributory factors to rising caesarean section rates and missed opportunities for timely interventions. An important limitation is its high false-positive rate and poor specificity, which undermines reliably identifying foetuses at risk of hypoxia-related injuries. These shortcomings are compounded by the technology's significant intra- and interobserver variability, as well as the subjective and complex nature of fetal heart rate interpretation. However, human factors and other environmental factors are equally significant. Advancements in fetal heart rate monitoring are crucial to support clinicians in improving health outcomes for newborns and their mothers, while at the same time avoiding unnecessary operative deliveries. These limitations highlight the clinical need to enhance neonatal outcomes while minimising unnecessary interventions, such as instrumental deliveries or caesarean sections. We believe that achieving this requires a paradigm shift from subjective interpretation of complex and nonspecific fetal heart rate patterns to evidence-based, quantifiable solutions that integrate hardware, engineering and clinical perspectives. Such transformation necessitates an international, multidisciplinary effort encompassing the entire continuum of pregnancy care and the broader healthcare ecosystem, with emphasis on well-defined, actionable health outcomes. Achieving this will depend on collaborations between researchers, clinicians, medical device manufacturers and other relevant stakeholders. This expert review paper outlines the most relevant and promising directions for research and strategic initiatives to address current challenges in fetal heart rate monitoring. Key themes include advancements in computerised fetal heart rate monitoring, the application of big data and artificial intelligence, innovations in home and remote monitoring and consideration of human factors.",Lovers A; Warrick P,PeriGen Inc.; Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology,

Many laparoscopic mesh fixation techniques and devices are available, but there is a lack of high-certainty evidence favoring one fixation technique over another. This narrative review aimed to provide a comprehensive summary detailing the available mesh fixation techniques and devices used in laparoscopic groin hernia repair. Information about mesh fixation techniques and devices was searched in PubMed, groin hernia guidelines, and medical technology companies webpages. This review outlines various mesh fixation techniques, materials, and their features in laparoscopic groin hernia repair. We have summarized and presented in detail the available information on both penetrating and non-penetrating mesh fixation techniques, including the option of not fixating the mesh. Penetrating mesh fixation includes tacks, staples, and sutures. Tacks vary in size, absorption time, and shape and can be further categorized into absorbable and permanent materials. Additionally, this review describes two types of permanent titanium staples and the use of permanent and absorbable sutures as mesh fixation. Non-penetrating mesh fixation includes self-fixating mesh and glue. The types of glue are cyanoacrylate glue and fibrin sealant. While fibrin sealant requires careful thawing from a frozen state before use, cyanoacrylate glue offers easier storage but poses a risk of exothermic reaction with the surrounding tissue. Self-fixating meshes have an adhesive side made of microgrips or adhesive material, and a permanent side.

Cardiovascular interventions,10.1016/j.jcin.2025.01.424,"In patients at high bleeding risk (HBR), short dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is associated with reduced bleeding and preserved ischemic protection. The aim of this study was to compare 2 short DAPT regimens, followed by aspirin monotherapy, in women and men at HBR undergoing PCI. Data from 3 prospective, international studies (XIENCE Short DAPT Program) including patients at HBR undergoing PCI with fluoropolymer-based cobalt-chromium everolimus-eluting stents (XIENCE) were analyzed. The primary endpoint was the composite of death or myocardial infarction (MI) at 1 year. The key secondary endpoint was Bleeding Academic Research Consortium (BARC) types 2 to 5 bleeding. Among 3,364 patients, 1,154 (34.3%) were women. At 1 year, the rates of death or MI (7.6% vs 8.1%) and BARC types 2 to 5 bleeding (9.5% vs 9.2%) were similar in women and men. One-month and 3-month DAPT conferred a similar risk for death or MI in women (adjusted HR: 0.86; 95% CI: 0.54-1.36) and men (adjusted HR: 1.04; 95% CI: 0.75-1.44) (P for interaction = 0.783).

Some patients resist conventional treatments, leading to the search for combination therapies. This study aimed to compare the efficacy of 308-nm excimer laser monotherapy versus combined treatment with topical bimatoprost 0.03% in patients with facial vitiligo. A single-blind randomized clinical trial was conducted at Razi Hospital, Tehran, on 38 patients with facial vitiligo who had at least one facial vitiligo patch and had not undergone treatment in the past 3 months. The patients were randomly allocated to either the intervention group (n = 18) or the control group (n = 20). Both groups received 308-nm EL therapy twice weekly for 15 weeks, while the intervention group additionally applied 0.03% bimatoprost solution daily. The patients were visited at the end of every 5 weeks and after the 15th week. Efficacy was evaluated using the scale for improvement assessment (SAI), visual analog scale satisfaction (VASS), and visual analog scale improvement (VASI). Data analysis was performed using the Mann-Whitney and t-tests, with a significance level set at p < 0.05. Of the total patients, 27 (71.05%) were female and 11 (28.95%) were male. The male-to-female ratio was 50% in the intervention group and 33.33% in the control group. The mean VASI score, as the primary outcome, showed a significant increase over time in the intervention group (p ≤ 0.001), increasing from 4.53 to 7.20 (an increase of 2.67 units). Additionally, the intervention had a significant effect on the VASI outcome compared to the control (p ≤ 0.001; mean difference: 2.55 [1.63 to 3.47]). As the secondary outcomes, the mean VASS and SAI scores significantly decreased over time in the intervention group (p ≤ 0.05). The intervention also significantly affected the VASS and SAI outcomes compared to the control (p ≤ 0.001). The side effects of the intervention group were hypertrichosis in three patients and erythema burning in one patient.

Damage in the skin can not only lead to bleeding and increase the risk of infection and inflammation but also result in tissue necrosis and scar formations. Therefore, wound dressings of high efficiency and intrinsic biocompatibility are essential for defending the wound sites and promoting healing. However, the state-of-the-art wound dressings have intrinsic shortcomings in curing, which would exudate due to limited water absorption capacity and the adhesion side effect, which may cause secondary damages. There remains a gap in the availability of wound dressings that simultaneously integrate antibacterial, self-healing, biodegradable, and temperature-sensitive properties. Herein, a bioinspired supramolecular hydrogel-based wound dressing composed of a KYD (KYDYKYDYKK) self-assembly peptide-agar double-network is developed with the assistance of 3D printing. The reversible self-assembling dynamics of the KYD along with the existence of lysine residues endow the double-networks with the ability of self-healing and antibacterial properties, while the introduction of agar allows the bioinspired system to be temperature sensitive. In addition, the grid size of the bioinspired dressing is light-stimulated and adaptable, allowing for real-time control of air permeability. Combined with intrinsic biodegradability, the multifunctional supramolecular wound dressing enables sustainable drug releases. Consequently, the programmability of strength, flexibility, and performances in this design ensures customizability in a variety of wound conditions of the bioinspired supramolecular wound dressing, thus showing promising potential in enhancing clinical wound management and improving patient lifecare.",Han S,China Petroleum Engineering & Construction Corporation Southwest Company,

A total of 734 IDH-wildtype glioblastoma patients were enrolled between 2005 and 2022. LM at recurrence was diagnosed with MRI including postcontrast FLAIR. Logistic analysis for development of LM at recurrence was performed with clinical, molecular, imaging (including tumor volume and distance to subventricular zone via automatic segmentation), and surgical data including extent of resection and ventricular entry. The overall survival (OS) was compared between patients with and without LM at recurrence. The incidence of LM at recurrence based on postcontrast FLAIR was 10.8% (79 patients). On multivariable analysis, younger age at diagnosis (odds ratio (OR) = 0.98, p = 0.011) and ventricular entry (OR = 3.15, p < 0.001) were independent predictors of LM at recurrence. However, patients with LM at recurrence showed no significant difference in OS from patients without LM (log-rank test; p = 0.461), with median OS of 18.0 (95% confidence interval (CI) 16.2-19.8) and 18.5 (95% CI 16.4-20.7) months in patients with and without LM at recurrence, respectively. The incidence of LM at recurrence is relatively high in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma patients. Younger age and ventricular entry during surgery warrant imaging surveillance for LM at recurrence. As LM at recurrence showed no significant OS compromise and larger extent of resection (EOR) is associated with survival benefits, ventricular entry during maximal safe resection may be acceptable.

The SF item measures the number of very soft/liquid stools and the AP item measures abdominal pain severity, which are common Crohn's disease (CD) symptoms that patients consider important to treat. This study evaluated the psychometric properties of both PRO items separately and estimated thresholds for clinical remission in moderately to severely active CD. The measurement properties of the PRO items were analyzed using pooled data from VIVID-1 (NCT03926130), a Phase 3, randomized, placebo- and active-controlled study in adults with moderately to severely active CD. Analyses used weekly average scores of the SF and AP items at Weeks 0 (Baseline), 4, 12, and 52. Remission thresholds were estimated using the Patient Global Rating of Severity (PGRS) and Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC) as primary anchors as well as qualitative evidence from exit interviews. Data from 1065 participants (mean age: 36.2 years [standard deviation: 13 years]) were analyzed. During the trial, scores improved for both PRO items. Both items demonstrated moderate-to-good test-retest reliability for participants defined as stable based on PGRS and PGIC. Most correlations of related assessments were moderate (0.30≤|ρ| <0.70) with SF and moderate-to-large (0.30≤|ρ| ≤0.90) with AP. By contrast, as anticipated, both items had weak correlations (|ρ| <0.30) with endoscopic and laboratory assessments. The PRO items could discriminate between groups of participants known to differ based on other assessments. The PRO items were able to detect change, as score changes in both items between Baseline and Weeks 12 and 52 differed significantly between most PGRS and PGIC categories. Anchor-based analyses combined with responses from the exit interviews suggested that an SF score of ≤ 3 and an AP score of ≤ 1 could together represent clinical remission. These results support the reliability, construct-validity, and responsiveness of both PRO items in moderately to severely active CD and confirm previously suggested scores for both items that could represent clinical remission. Clinicaltrials.gov, NCT03926130. Registered 23 April 2019, https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03926130 . This study focused on two of the questions (or “items”) from a commonly used questionnaires in Crohn’s disease: the Stool Frequency (SF) item, which counts the number of very soft or liquid stools in a 24-hour period, and the Abdominal Pain (AP) item, which rates severity of abdominal pain in the same time period. We are referring to these two items as the “Patient Reported Outcome” (PRO). This study looked at how well each of these two items did in measuring what they are supposed to measure by using data from people with Crohn’s disease who had participated in a clinical trial. Trial participants answered the SF and AP daily during the trial by using an electronic diary device. Some of the participants were also interviewed to find out when they would consider their disease to be in remission (no longer active). The results showed that both PRO items (SF and AP) can be used by people with Crohn’s disease to accurately measure their very soft or liquid stool frequency and abdominal pain. Further, we estimated which scores on SF and AP could tell us whether someone with Crohn’s disease has achieved remission of their very soft or liquid stools and of their abdominal pain.",Vadhariya A; Su S; Zhou X; Durand F; Kawata AK; Stassek L; Clucas C,Eli Lilly and Company; Syneos Health; Evidera,vadhariya_aisha@lilly.com.

The present study was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial with a crossover design conducted at the Shinjuku-Yoyogi Mental Lab Clinic between June 2021 and December 2023. A total of 57 Japanese outpatients aged 20-74 years diagnosed with mild MDD were randomly assigned to use active or placebo 40-Hz violet light irradiation goggles for 4 weeks by adaptive allocation. Each participant wore their goggles for 4 weeks with 4-week washout intervals, while their medications for depression remained unchanged. The primary endpoints were the changes in the Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale score (Phases I and II) 4 weeks after wearing the active and placebo goggles and differences between the group's scores. The safety of the violet light irradiation goggles was also investigated. The Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale scores of the participants who wore active violet light irradiation goggles significantly improved compared with those of their counterparts, who wore placebo goggles (95 % confidence interval: -2.5 to -0.1; p = 0.042). No adverse events related to wearing the violet light irradiation goggles were observed. Violet light irradiation goggles are non-invasive and may be effective for treating mild MDD.

Telerehabilitation, delivered via digital platforms, represents a promising approach for intensive continuation of stroke rehabilitation after discharge. The Swiss tele-assisted rehabilitation and training program (START), delivered through the Blended Clinic mobile application, seeks to support patients to start during inpatient rehabilitation, continue during the transition to the home environment, continue until outpatient rehabilitation starts and beyond. The study aims to evaluate feasibility, safety and performance of the START program on the Blended Clinic platform during inpatient, transition, and outpatient rehabilitation with patients in the early and late subacute phase after a stroke. Furthermore, patients' functional status, mobility and activity level, and health-related quality of life are monitored. This single-center feasibility trial with three measurement sessions will include 40 patients, who will be introduced to START during their inpatient rehabilitation. Patients will continue for 12 weeks post-discharge. For the feasibility assessment, process-, training- and mHealth-related parameter will be evaluated, which include recruitment rate, process-evaluation, safety, adherence, drop-out rate, stability and maintenance of the system, usability, quality, satisfaction, user and program experience, and perceived change. Secondary outcomes will focus on motor function, mobility, quality of life, activity level, heart rate, blood pressure, and performance-based measures. The study's strengths include its foundation in previous usability analyses, which informed refinements to the START program. The study's design is based on the ISO 14155 standard, ensuring high standards for medical device research and supporting the future certification of the START program on the Blended Clinic platform. Potential challenges include patient self-reporting via the mobile application and barriers related to technology use among older adults and older mobile devices. Additionally, the availability of coaching is limited to business hours, which may affect adherence. Despite these challenges, the study's findings will provide insights into the feasibility of mobile-based telerehabilitation and guide the design of a future randomized controlled trial.

39958263,Influence of dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate levels on the slower age-related decline in grey matter in younger women with polycystic ovary syndrome.,,Brain communications,10.1093/braincomms/fcaf052,"Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is characterized by excess androgens, ovulatory disorders and a higher prevalence of obesity and metabolic disturbances including Type 2 diabetes, hyperlipidaemia and hypertension, some of which are risk factors for neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease and brain atrophy. However, it is unclear whether brain ageing occurs more rapidly in women with PCOS compared with those without PCOS. Except for the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis involved in the conventional ovulatory process, little is known regarding the role of the grey matter in the pathogenesis of PCOS, and limited existing studies examining brain structures in PCOS have shown inconsistent results. This case-control study aimed to investigate the age-related differences in total and regional brain grey matter volume and average cortical thickness in young women with and without PCOS by using brain magnetic resonance imaging to understand whether women with PCOS exhibit distinctive patterns of brain ageing, and their association with factors including obesity, hyperandrogenism and metabolic disturbances. Seventy-six women diagnosed with PCOS and 68 age-matched women without PCOS (aged 20-35 years) underwent brain magnetic resonance imaging to measure grey matter volume and cortical thickness. Anthropometric, hormonal and metabolic measurements were conducted to assess their associations with the investigated brain structures. In women without PCOS, increasing age was significantly correlated with a decrease in global grey matter volume (",,,

Endoscopic third ventriculostomy has become more prevalent, and shunt surgery has become more protocolized through research efforts by the Hydrocephalus Clinical Research Network. In 2014, the Pediatric Hydrocephalus Guidelines were first published, providing a cohesive source for clinical guidance. We planned to investigate national trends in the management of pediatric hydrocephalus after the publication of the 2014 Pediatric Hydrocephalus Guidelines as guidelines act as a compilation of historic and recent literature in a scientific field. A multipronged approach was used to evaluate changes in the treatment of pediatric hydrocephalus since 2014. First, we queried the Pediatric Health Information System between 2013 and 2018 to identify national trends in shunt procedures for hydrocephalus. To assess the recommendation in the guidelines to use antibiotic-impregnated catheters (AICs) in shunts, national sales records of AICs were obtained from 2 large neurosurgical device companies. A total of 11,179 shunt procedures were performed within the Pediatric Health Information System database in the study period. In the preguideline publication period (2013-2014), there was a shunt revision-to-placement ratio of 1.63 while in the postguideline publication period (2015-2018), there was a ratio of 0.84 ( Findings from this investigation suggest progress in pediatric hydrocephalus management since 2014. The shunt revision-to-placement ratio improved, and the use of AICs increased over this period. Improved outcomes are likely associative findings rather than causative with the guidelines representing a culmination of widespread changes in hydrocephalus care such as increased use of endoscopic third ventriculostomies, protocolized care, and image-guided shunt placement. Further research into the impact of clinical practice guidelines is needed to better understand the impact of this tool on surgeons and patient care.",,,

A 58-year-old woman with a history of spontaneous basal ganglia hemorrhage 2 years before presented to our clinic with a dilated, multilobulated, and overlapping lesion located at a dominant left accessory middle cerebral artery, compatible with the diagnostic criteria of a PAM. The lesion was near the previous bleeding site, and since perforating and cortical vessels arose from its distal lobule, a safeguarding superficial temporal artery-MCA bypass was considered necessary before the successful endovascular embolization of the malformation using nBCA (Glubran2/Lipiodol). PAMs can be associated with intracranial bleeding; thus, active treatment is warranted for selected patients.

Compared to microneedles composed of drug-polymer solid dispersions, they offer higher drug loading while possessing mechanical strength for skin penetration. However, their microneedle structure and associated mechanical strength are reliant on the component glass stability. This study investigates relationships between the glass stability of drug-only microneedles and drug glass-forming ability (GFA), determined by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) analysis. The glass stability of microneedles fabricated from six drugs was evaluated at 2-8 °C under nitrogen, 25 °C/60% relative humidity (RH), and 40 °C/75% RH. Drug glass stability was determined by visual assessment of microneedle appearance, together with DSC and powder X-ray diffraction analysis of the drug melt cooled outside the microneedle molds. Glassy microneedle structure was retained for all drugs stored at 2-8 °C under nitrogen for 3 months. Drug GFA classes informed glass stability under dry (nitrogen) environments at temperatures below their glass transition temperature. Under controlled humidity conditions, all glass microneedles crystallized, except for itraconazole. Drug GFA did not inform microneedle glass stability when exposed to water vapor during storage due to water absorption and glass plasticization. Itraconazole's glass stability was attributed to the interaction of absorbed water with liquid crystalline phases present in the itraconazole glass. The results highlight how glassy microneedle stability is informed by storage below ",Sartawi Z; Faisal W,ArrayPatch Ltd.,
39956304,Exploration of biomaterial-tissue integration in heterogeneous microporous annealed particle scaffolds in subcutaneous implants over 12 months.,2025-05-07,Acta biomaterialia,10.1016/j.actbio.2025.02.020,"Microporous annealed particle (MAP) scaffolds are comprised of hydrogel microparticles with inter- and intra-particle cross-links that provide structure and cell-scale porosity, making them an increasingly attractive option for injectable tissue augmentation. Many current injectable biomaterials create a substantial foreign body response (FBR), while MAP scaffolds mitigate this response and have the potential to facilitate the formation of new tissue, though this de novo tissue formation is poorly understood. Here, we leverage a subcutaneous implant model to explore the maturation of MAP implants with and without heparin microislands (µislands) over one year to identify the effect of bioactive particles on scaffold maturation. Implants were measured and explanted after 1, 3, 6, and 12 months and analyzed using immunofluorescence staining and RNA-sequencing. No fibrous capsule or significant FBR was observed, and though a significant amount of MAP remains at 12 months, we still see a volume decrease over time. Heparin µislands facilitate increased cell infiltration and recruit a wider variety of cells at 1 month than blank MAP scaffolds, although this effect diminishes after 3 months. Transcriptomics reveal a potential activation of the complement-mediated immune response at 12 months in both groups, possibly associated with pore collapse in the implants. A single 12-month sample avoided this outcome, yielding complete cell infiltration, vascularization, and substantial matrix deposition throughout. Future work will characterize the effect of implantation site and facilitate increased matrix deposition to support the scaffold and prevent pore collapse. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Injectable biomaterials are increasingly used clinically for soft tissue augmentation and regeneration but still face significant issues from the foreign body reaction. While some materials intentionally promote this response to stimulate collagen deposition, porous materials like MAP scaffolds can mitigate the immune response and allow for true tissue integration. However, this integration is poorly understood, particularly on long timescales, as traditional materials are dominated by inflammatory signals. In this work, we leverage a minimally inflammatory subcutaneous implant to investigate the maturation of MAP scaffolds with and without bioactive heparin-containing particles. The results presented here contribute a better understanding of the long-term material-tissue dynamics of MAP scaffolds that can inform future material design for tissue augmentation.",,,drgriffin@virginia.edu.

Pharmaceutical companies' discontinuation of research hinders new agents, while MDR pathogens or ""superbugs"" worsen the problem. Superbugs pose a threat to common infections and medical procedures, exacerbated by limited antibiotic development and rapid antibiotic resistance. The rising tide of antimicrobial resistance threatens to undermine progress in controlling infectious diseases. This review examines the global proliferation of AMR, its underlying mechanisms, and contributing factors. The study explores various methodologies, emphasizing the significance of precise and timely identification of resistant strains. We discuss recent advancements in CRISPR/Cas9, nanoparticle technology, light-based techniques, and AI-powered antibiogram analysis for combating AMR. Traditional methods often fail to effectively combat multidrug-resistant bacteria, as CRISPR-Cas9 technology offers a more effective approach by cutting specific DNA sequences, precision targeting and genome editing. AI-based smartphone applications for antibiogram analysis in resource-limited settings face challenges like internet connectivity, device compatibility, data quality, energy consumption, and algorithmic limitations. Additionally, light-based antimicrobial techniques are increasingly being used to effectively kill antibiotic-resistant microbial species and treat localized infections. This review provides an in-depth overview of AMR covering epidemiology, evolution, mechanisms, infection prevention, control measures, antibiotic access, stewardship, surveillance, challenges and emerging non-antibiotic therapeutic approaches.",Bhukya PL; Subbaiyan A,Rodent Experimentation Facility,nlmthakur4@gmail.com.

This study examined the incidence of, and factors associated with, SM development after the use of two surface-modified FDs: the p48MW-HPC and p64MW-HPC. A non-concurrent cohort study was conducted in 404 consecutive patients with UIAs treated with these two FDs between January 2020 and July 2023. The primary endpoint was the number of asymptomatic DWI lesions within 72 h after the procedure. SMs were detected in 58.2% of the cases, and ≥ 20 lesions were identified in 7.2% of cases. Multivariate analysis revealed that the use of two specific types of microcatheters-Prowler Select Plus (P < 0.001; IRR, 3.2) and RapidTransit (P = 0.001; IRR, 2.2)-and difficulty in microcatheter navigation to the target vessel (P = 0.039; IRR, 1.8) were significantly associated with greater numbers of lesions. After exclusion of outlier cases, these devices remained associated with a significant 2‑ to 3‑fold increase in SMs. Diabetes was associated with fewer SMs (P = 0.024; IRR, 0.5), although this association disappeared after exclusion of outlier cases. The postprocedural incidence of SMs associated with hydrophilic polymer-coated FDs was similar to that previously reported. Interestingly, the main factor contributing to this phenomenon was the use of certain microcatheters.

Herein, we developed a new sericin hydrogel with excellent antioxidative and antimicrobial features for the treatment of diabetic wounds. This hydrogel was prepared from a native sericin solution collected from silk fibroin-deficient mutant silkworm bodies; it also possesses exceptional ductility, high transparency, and excellent biocompatibility, enabling the hydrogel dressing to effectively eliminate excessive reactive oxygen species, while preventing bacterial infections within the diabetic wound microenvironment. Additionally, the hydrogel facilitates real-time monitoring of wounds and surgical sutures. Furthermore, it demonstrates pH-responsive swelling and degradation properties, along with a microporous structure, which collectively foster a moist, flexible, and breathable environment conducive to tissue regeneration, thereby promoting wound healing. Moreover, the hydrogel promotes the adhesion and proliferation of NIH3T3 cells, and in vivo studies highlight its ability to expedite wound healing. These findings suggest that the formic acid-treated sericin hydrogel dressing holds great promise as an advanced solution for managing diabetic wounds.",,,zyssri@just.edu.cn.

However, central venous catheters play a critical role in the resuscitation of patients with hypotensive trauma. We sought to identify factors associated with successful placement of central venous catheter and hypothesized that attending surgeons would be more successful than trainees in the placement of central venous catheters. We analyzed data abstracted from audiovisual recordings from a multicenter study of intravascular access in hypotensive (initial systolic blood pressure <90 mm Hg) injured patients. The primary exposure of interest was practitioner type (attendings compared with trainees [residents/fellows]). The primary outcome of interest was central venous catheter access attempt success rate. We also examined success rates stratified by site of attempt (femoral compared with subclavian) and the association between attempt success and patient factors. A total of 242 central venous catheter access attempts occurred in 171 patients (median age, 38 years [interquartile range, 27-53], 84% male, Injury Severity Score of 26 [interquartile range, 17-41], initial systolic blood pressure 59 [interquartile range, 0-78] mm Hg) across 15 centers. Trainees performed 170 of 242 (70%) of central venous catheter attempts. Success did not differ between groups (attendings 60% vs trainees 59%, P = .96). Patient factors including age, sex, mechanism, and Injury Severity Score were not associated with central venous catheter success rates, but success rates were greater in patients with measurable systolic blood pressure (71% vs 45%, P < .001). Attendings were more successful than trainees at subclavian attempts (66% vs 44%, P = .04). No significant difference was found in overall central venous catheter success rate by practitioner type, but attendings were more successful at subclavian lines, and, on average, approximately 1 minute faster. Patient condition and skill level should be considered when providing trainees with the opportunity to place central venous catheter in hypotensive patients, particularly at the subclavian location.",,,dholena@mcw.edu.

However, in this context, accurate and reliable episode labeling by expert cardiologists still remains a manual, costly, and time-consuming process. In this work, we propose using Active Learning (AL) to design classification models that streamline the manual labeling of cardiac arrhythmic episodes. When AL is used, relevant episodes for classification are selected and then presented to the human expert for labeling, thereby dramatically reducing the manual labeling burden. We adapted four large-margin-based AL strategies to a previously proposed classification methodology. We benchmarked them on problems involving 3 and 8 arrhythmia types using 9908 episodes from a massive national ICD data repository. Specifically, the relevance of episode-patient diversity for classification was evaluated. Results showed that the gold standard performance, achieved using all episodes, was reached by using approximately 20% (50%) of episodes from 60% (85%) of patients in the 3-class (8-class) model design. We can conclude that AL techniques are advantageous for designing classification models and can streamline the human labeling process of large ICD datasets.",Lillo-Castellano JM; Mora-Jiménez I; Martín-Méndez M; Cerdá L; Rojo-Álvarez JL,Medtronic Ibérica ®S.A; Universidad Rey Juan Carlos,joseluis.rojo@urjc.es.

Cataract remains the leading cause of blindness worldwide, and cataract surgery is the most commonly performed surgical procedure worldwide, but to date has received little analysis in this field. The aim of this study was to evaluate the carbon impact of streamlining single-use packs, and transitioning from single-use items, to reusable equivalents in cataract surgery. A focus group and prospective audit was carried out to identify single-use pack items for streamlining. A bottom-up, process-based carbon footprint analysis was conducted of single-use items and reusable alternatives using activity data provided by the suppliers and greenhouse gas (GHG) conversion factors from the UK Government GHG Conversion Factors for Company Reporting database. Total carbon savings from streamlining was 935 kgCO2e/year, and switching, was 309 kgCO2e/year. Single-use items had a 27 times greater carbon footprint than reusable equivalents (322 kgCO2 vs. 12 kgCO2e respectively). A net carbon saving was achieved from 19 or more re-uses of the reusable items compared to single-use equivalents. This study provides evidence of carbon emissions savings both from streamlining disposable instruments in cataract surgical packs, and from switching from single-use to reusable instruments. Mitigation strategies targeting hotspots in resource intensive areas will be an important aspect of reducing the climate burden of surgery.

R software was used to perform meta-analyses. Eight uncontrolled, two non-randomized, and two RCTs evaluated 369 teeth in 6-31year-old participants. Six studies followed the standard resin infiltration protocol, while the others reported modifications. The meta-analysis estimated an overall proportion of total masking of 37 % (CI: 18-55). Modified protocols tended to achieve higher success rates (40 %; CI: 9-72) compared to standard protocols (30 %; CI: 17-44), though this difference was not statistically significant.

We assessed the risk of bias (RoB) for SER and AL using the Cochrane RoB 2 tool. We followed standard Cochrane methods. We rated the certainty of evidence using the GRADE approach for change in SER and AL at one and two years. We used the surface under the cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA) to rank the interventions for all available outcomes. We included 104 studies (40 new for this update) that randomised 17,509 children, aged 4 years to 18 years. Most studies were conducted in China or other Asian countries (66.3%), and North America (14.4%). Eighty-four studies (80.8%) compared myopia control interventions against inactive controls. Study durations ranged from 12 months to 48 months. Since most of the networks in the NMA were poorly connected, our estimates are based on direct (pairwise) comparisons, unless stated otherwise. The median change in SER for controls was -0.65 D (55 studies, 4888 participants; one-year follow-up). These interventions may reduce SER progression compared to controls: repeated low intensity red light (RLRL: MD 0.80 D, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.71 to 0.89; SUCRA = 93.8%; very low-certainty evidence); high-dose atropine (HDA (≥ 0.5%): MD 0.90 D, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.18; SUCRA = 93.3%; moderate-certainty evidence); medium-dose atropine (MDA (0.1% to < 0.5%): MD 0.55 D, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.93; NMA estimate SUCRA = 75.5%; low-certainty evidence); low dose atropine (LDA (< 0.1%): MD 0.25 D, 95% CI 0.16 to 0.35; SUCRA = 53.2%; very low-certainty evidence); peripheral plus spectacle lenses (PPSL: MD 0.45 D, 95% CI 0.16 to 0.74; SUCRA = 50.2%; very low-certainty evidence); multifocal soft contact lenses (MFSCL: MD 0.27 D, 95% CI 0.18 to 0.35; SUCRA = 49.9%; very low-certainty evidence); and multifocal spectacle lenses (MFSL: MD 0.14 D, 95% CI 0.08 to 0.21; SUCRA = 30.8%; low-certainty evidence). The median change in AL for controls was 0.33 mm (58 studies, 9085 participants; one-year follow-up). These interventions may reduce axial elongation compared to controls: RLRL (MD -0.33 mm, 95% CI -0.37 to -0.29; SUCRA = 98.6%; very low-certainty evidence); HDA (MD -0.33 mm, 95% CI -0.35 to -0.30; SUCRA = 88.4%; moderate-certainty evidence); MDA (MD -0.24 mm, 95% CI -0.34 to -0.15; NMA estimate SUCRA = 75.8%; low-certainty evidence); LDA (MD -0.10 mm, 95% CI -0.13 to -0.07; SUCRA = 36.1%; very low-certainty evidence); orthokeratology (ortho-K: MD -0.18 mm, 95% CI -0.21 to -0.14; SUCRA = 79%; moderate-certainty evidence); PPSL (MD -0.13 mm, 95% CI -0.21 to -0.05; SUCRA = 52.6%; very low-certainty evidence); MFSCL (MD -0.11 mm, 95% CI -0.13 to -0.09; SUCRA = 45.6%; low-certainty evidence); and MFSL (MD -0.06 mm, 95% CI -0.09 to -0.04; SUCRA = 26.3%; low-certainty evidence). Ortho-K plus LDA probably reduces axial elongation more than ortho-K monotherapy (MD -0.12 mm, 95% CI -0.15 to -0.09; SUCRA = 81.8%; moderate-certainty evidence). At two-year follow-up, change in SER was reported in 34 studies (3556 participants). The median change in SER for controls was -1.01 D. The ranking of interventions to reduce SER progression was close to that observed at one year; there were insufficient data to draw conclusions on cumulative effects. The highest-ranking interventions were: HAD (SUCRA = 97%); MDA (NMA estimate SUCRA = 69.8%); and PPSL (SUCRA = 69.1%). At two-year follow-up, change in AL was reported in 33 studies (3334 participants). The median change in AL for controls was 0.56 mm. The ranking of interventions to reduce axial elongation was similar to that observed at one year; there were insufficient data to draw conclusions on cumulative effects. The highest-ranking interventions were: ortho-K plus LDA (SUCRA = 94.2%); HAD (SUCRA = 96.8%); and MDA (NMA estimate SUCRA = 88.4%). There was limited evidence on whether cessation of myopia control therapy increases progression beyond the expected rate of progression with age. Adverse events and treatment adherence were not consistently reported. Two studies reported quality of life, showing little to no difference between intervention and control groups. We were unable to draw firm conclusions regarding the relative costs or efficiency of different myopia control strategies in children. Most studies compared pharmacological and optical treatments to slow the progression of myopia with an inactive comparator. These interventions may slow refractive change and reduce axial elongation, although results were often heterogeneous. Less evidence is available for two years and beyond; uncertainty remains about the sustained effect of these interventions. Longer term and better quality studies comparing myopia control interventions alone or in combination are needed, with improved methods for monitoring and reporting adverse effects.

Eschar tissue, which forms in response to severe burns, contains viable fibroblasts, which migrate from the surrounding tissue in response to burn injury and exhibit a myofibroblast phenotype. The goal of this study was to characterise eschar-derived fibroblasts and examine their use for engineered in vitro full skin equivalents in comparison to normal dermal fibroblasts, which were harvested from non-injured skin. Microarray analysis indicated that eschar fibroblasts differ from dermal fibroblasts in various biological processes including inflammation, extracellular matrix formation, cell migration and differentiation. Skin equivalents with eschar fibroblasts showed similarities to those generated using normal dermal fibroblasts in terms of epidermis and dermis formation. However, in contrast to dermal fibroblast-based full skin equivalents, eschar fibroblast-based equivalents exhibited macroscopic contractile behaviour. In addition, eschar fibroblasts-based equivalents demonstrated higher alpha-smooth muscle actin expression on mRNA and protein levels. In conclusion, our findings suggest that eschar fibroblasts-based full skin equivalents hold promise as a platform to study burn wound environments as eschar fibroblasts are clinically more relevant fibroblasts and able to mimic certain aspects of the challenging wound environment in vitro.",Kutluoğlu GC; Vlig M; Elgersma A; Boekema BKHL; Doberenz C; Manikowski D,Burn Research Lab; Innovation,

This study develops a compact real-time dosimeter using silicon photomultipliers, plastic scintillators, and optical fibers and evaluates its in vivo applicability for radiation therapy. Dose calibration, dose-rate dependency and linearity, and short-term repeatability tests were conducted using solid water phantoms and bolus materials, and in vivo dosimetry was performed using an in-house phantom. The characterization evaluation results showed high linearity, with a coefficient of determination of 0.9995 for dose rates of 100-600 monitoring units (MU)/min, confirming an error rate within 2% when converted to dosage. In the short-term repeatability tests, the dosimeter exhibited good characteristics, with relative standard deviation (RSD) values lower than 2% for each beam delivery and an RSD value of 0.03% over ten beam deliveries. Dose measurements using the phantom indicated an average error rate of 3.83% compared to the values calculated using the treatment planning system. These results demonstrate a performance comparable to that of commercial metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistors and plastic scintillator-based dosimeters. Based on these findings, the developed dosimeter has significant potential for in vivo radiation therapy applications.",Kim Y,Marine Radioactivity Monitoring Group,

Cardiovascular interventions,10.1016/j.jcin.2024.10.018,"Management of recurrent mitral regurgitation (MR) or relevant iatrogenic mitral valve (MV) stenosis after mitral transcatheter edge-to-edge repair (M-TEER) emerges as an increasingly relevant clinical issue. Surgery after M-TEER is associated with higher morbidity and mortality. Electrosurgical leaflet laceration and stabilization of the implant (ELASTA-Clip) followed by transcatheter mitral valve replacement (TMVR) is an innovative, less-invasive treatment option for patients with TEER failure. The authors sought to evaluate the early results of ELASTA-Clip followed by transapical TMVR in patients with symptomatic failed M-TEER (defined as persistent or recurrent MR, or iatrogenic MV stenosis). Data from symptomatic patients with failed M-TEER who underwent ELASTA-Clip followed by compassionate use or commercial transapical TMVR using the Abbott Tendyne system were retrospectively collected from 8 tertiary care centers in 4 countries. Safety and efficacy of the procedure were assessed up to 1 year according to Mitral Valve Academic Research Consortium (MVARC) criteria. A total of 22 patients (mean age 77.8 ± 9.2 years, 40.9% [9/22] female) at high surgical risk (EuroSCORE II 8.0 ± 0.4, STS score 7.2% ± 1.1%) with symptomatic residual MR ≥3+ (n = 21) or iatrogenic MV stenosis (n = 1) after failed M-TEER were followed for a median period of 8.5 [Q1-Q3: 2.6-11.6] months. The ELASTA-Clip procedure (90.9% [20/22] transseptal, 9.1% [2/22] transapical) followed by TMVR were successful in all patients (22/22). Technical success according to MVARC was achieved in 21 patients (21/22, 95.4%) without left ventricular outflow tract obstruction or conversion to sternotomy. At 30 days, 3 patients had paravalvular leak progression, ischemic stroke occurred in 3 patients (3/20, 15.0%). Baseline MR (≥3+ in 95.5% [21/22]) was reduced to grade 1+ or less in all patients with durable results in 89.5% (17/19) (P < 0.001). NYHA functional class significantly improved to ≤II in 81.3% (13/16) at discharge (P < 0.001) and 72.2% (13/18) at last follow-up (P < 0.001). At 30 days, all patients (20/20) were alive. Three patients (3/20, 15.0%) were rehospitalized for heart failure (uncontrolled atrial fibrillation in 2 cases) and 1 of them (1/22, 4.5%) underwent a reintervention (valve retensioning). Transapical TMVR after ELASTA-Clip is a feasible and less invasive option for the management of failed M-TEER that can be performed with acceptable results in a carefully selected patient population. Particular attention is required to avoid paravalvular leakage and measures to minimize the risk of periprocedural cerebrovascular events need to be implemented in future larger-scale prospective studies with longer-term follow-up.",Januska J,Department of Cardiology,fabien.praz@insel.ch.
39936906,Microfluidic droplets with amended culture media cultivate a greater diversity of soil microorganisms.,2025-05-07,Applied and environmental microbiology,10.1128/aem.01794-24,"Uncultivated but abundant soil microorganisms have untapped potential for producing broad ranges of natural products, as well as for bioremediation. However, cultivating soil microorganisms while maintaining a broad microorganism diversity to enable phenotyping and functional analysis of as diverse individual isolates as possible remains challenging. In this study, we developed and tested the ability of several culture media formulations that contain defined soil metabolites or soil extracts to maintain microorganism diversity during culture. We also assessed their performance in microfluidic droplet cultivation where single-soil microorganism isolates were encapsulated and cultivated in picoliter-volume water-in-oil emulsion droplets to enable clonal growth needed for downstream functional analyses. Our results show that droplet cultivation with media supplemented by soil extract or soil metabolites enables the recovery of soil microorganisms with higher diversity (up to 1.5-fold higher richness) compared to bulk cultivation methods. Importantly, 1.7-fold more of less abundant (<1%) phyla and 11-fold more of unique genera were recovered, demonstrating the utility of this method for interrogating highly diverse soil microorganisms for broad ranges of applications.IMPORTANCEAlthough soil microorganisms hold a significant value in bioproduction and bioremediation, only a small fraction-less than 1%-can be cultured under specific media and cultivation conditions. This indicates that there are ample opportunities in harvesting the diverse environmental microorganisms if isolating and recovering these uncultured microorganisms are possible.

Patients with cardiovascular disease (CVD) and peripheral artery disease (PAD) often do not meet national physical activity recommendations. They may, thus, benefit from a physical activity program using smartwatches. The Life Plus smartwatch is designed to facilitate activity monitoring by counting steps, but its validity needs to be determined, particularly in patients who may not have a normal gait, such as those with cardiovascular pathology. This study evaluates the accuracy of the Life Plus smartwatch (versions 2 and 3) in healthy adults, patients with CVD, and patients with PAD at different walking speeds (1.8, 2.5, 3.2, and 4 km/h) and different localizations (wrists, hips, and ankles) to determine best accuracy. In total, 34 participants, comprising healthy individuals (n=10), patients with CVD (n=14), and patients with PAD (n=10), wore 6 Life Plus watches simultaneously (3 of version 2 and 3 of version 3), located on wrists, hips, and ankles. Participants walked on a treadmill for 3-minute sessions at speeds of 1.8, 2.5, 3.2, and 4 km/h; they then performed a 10-minute free walking on the ground and again walked for 3-minute sessions on a treadmill at the same speeds. Actual step counts were recorded through video footage. When worn at the wrist, no significant difference between the actual number of steps and step count by version 2 watches was found in each group independently (healthy group: P=.25; CVD group: P=.50; and PAD group: P=.37). Significant differences were found with the version 2 watches at the wrist in the healthy group at 3.2 (-5.26%; P=.01) and 4 km/h (-6.13%; P=.008) and in the CVD group at 2.5 (-5.94%; P=.008), 3.2(-13.1%; P=.008), and 4 km/h (-13.96%; P=.004). When worn at the wrist, no significant difference between actual number of steps and step count by version 3 watches was found in the healthy group (P=.02) and the PAD group (P=.90). Significant differences were found with the version 3 watches at the wrist in the CVD group at 3.2 (-6.43%; P=.001) and 4 km/h (-7.3%; P=.01) and in the PAD group at 4 km/h (-5.77%; P=.04). For optimized counting when worn at the wrist, healthy individuals should prefer version 2 watches for slow walking (1.8 and 2.5 km/h) and version 3 for higher speeds (3.2 and 4 km/h). Patients (CVD and PAD) should prefer version 2 watches at 1.8 km/h and version 3 watches for higher speeds (2.5, 3.2, and 4 km/h).",Heizmann AN; Ollier E; Roche F; Le Hello C,INSERM,

To realize this potential in routine care, insulin data need to be distilled into actionable insights for clinicians. We describe two algorithms for detecting glucose excursions using continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) data and then link excursions to CIP data to derive ""insulin metrics"" characterizing suboptimal bolus dosing practices. This post hoc analysis used CGM and CIP data from a 12-week observational study (clinicaltrials.gov: NCT03368807) of 64 adults with type 1 or type 2 diabetes receiving multiple daily injection insulin therapy and glycated haemoglobin ≥8%. Two updated algorithms were applied to analyse glucose excursions associated with pre-meal boluses, missed bolus doses (MBDs), delayed boluses and correction boluses. Glycaemic metrics obtained using both algorithms were similar. Time in range (%TIR) was lower, and time above range (%TAR) and glycaemic variability (%GV) were higher, on days with MBDs. Compared with pre-meal boluses, delayed and correction boluses were followed by glucose excursions with larger change in glucose, longer duration with glucose >180 mg/dL, lower post-excursion %TIR and higher post-excursion %TAR; excursions following MBDs showed lower %TIR, higher %TAR and lower percent recovery. Glucose excursions were larger and longer when CGM was masked than when unmasked. This analysis demonstrates ""insulin metrics""-characterizations of insulin dosing behaviour derived from integrated CGM and CIP data-and provides a foundation for future work that will expand the understanding of an individual's insulin self-administration practices and improve clinical decision-making.",Rodbard D; Xue J; Johnson J; Dassau E,Eli Lilly and Company; Biomedical Informatics Consultants LLC,

Noninvasive treatment options are the first line of treatment. It would be beneficial to know when the bladder reaches its maximum capacity, to enable to prompt going to the bathroom on time and thereby potentially prevent an UI event. Recently, a wearable bladder sensor was developed, the TENA SmartCare Bladder Sensor (Bladder Sensor), which is intended to support children ( ≥ 6 years) and adults (BMI ≤ 25 kg/m Adults ( ≥ 18 years) suffering from UI during day and/or night tested the Bladder Sensor independently at home for 1 week. Device performance, safety, usability, user satisfaction and self-reported disease specific information, and QoL were assessed at pre-defined times. Intra-individual results were compared. Any episodes of urination and/or urine loss were documented by subjects in a paper diary. Raw data of the Bladder Sensor was analyzed to evaluate the bladder detection rate and full bladder notification rate(s). 30 adults (female/male: 67%/33%; median age: 53 years (Interquartile range (IQR) 32-61 years); median BMI of 22.6 kg/m It was demonstrated that the Bladder Sensor can detect the bladder under real-life conditions among its intended users and can support in the prevention of UI. This seemed dependent on anatomical limitations (e.g., BMI and body shape), bladder volume (low bladder detection rate < 100 mL), and/or proper fixation. The device had a positive effect on the subject's urinary incontinence, their Qo,L and overall well-being while testing it for 1 week. It is assumed that this effect will be strengthened when users incorporate the use of the device into their daily life.

Whole-blood samples were collected at the preoperative visit and after anesthetic induction in the operating room, and our cartridge was used to measure the coagulation time by DBCM. Plasma was used to evaluate thrombin generation and to perform in vitro quantification of factor Xa inhibitors. Spearman's correlation was used to analyze correlations, and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used to evaluate diagnostic performance.

The survey response rate was 20.4%. 18 participants were excluded due to incomplete responses in the survey. A total of 390 survey texts (19.5%) were analyzed. The gender distribution of the participants was as follows: 60% female and 40% male. Notably, none of the respondents used rubber dams for endodontic treatment. Male dentists were less likely to use a base under restorations (p < 0.05). Female dentists preferred single-session pulp capping for pulpal perforations (p < 0.05). Public hospitals utilized fewer panoramic films, while Oral and Dental Health Centers used fewer periapical films for diagnoses (p < 0.05). Glass ionomer cement was the most commonly used base material, and direct composite resin was the preferred choice for post-endodontic restorations, in contrast to the less favored indirect composite resin. Despite its advantages, the application of rubber dam was infrequent. Glass ionomer cement emerged as the predominant base material across all restoration types, exhibiting variability among dentists in diagnosis, treatment, and material selection.",,,nakgul@pau.edu.tr.

This study aimed to investigate the mediating role of sleep disturbance and the influence of anxiety on the relationship between night resting HR and depression severity. This is a secondary data analysis of data collected in the Remote Assessment of Disease and Relapse (RADAR) Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) longitudinal mobile health study, encompassing 461 participants (1774 observations) across three national centers (Netherlands, Spain, and the UK). Depression severity, anxiety, and sleep disturbance were assessed every three months. Night resting HR parameters in the 2 weeks preceding assessments were measured using a wrist-worn Fitbit device. Linear mixed models and causal mediation analysis were employed to examine the impact of sleep disturbance and anxiety on night resting HR on depression severity. Covariates included age, sex, BMI, smoking, alcohol consumption, antidepressant use, and comorbidities with other medical conditions. Higher night resting HR was linked to subsequent depressive severity, through the mediation of sleep disturbance. Anxiety contributed to an exacerbated level of sleep disturbance, subsequently intensifying depression severity. Anxiety exhibited no direct effect on night resting HR. Our findings underscore the mediating role of sleep disturbance in the effect of night resting HR on depression severity, and anxiety on depression severity. This insight has potential implications for early identification of indicators signalling worsening depression symptoms, enabling clinicians to initiate timely and responsive treatment measures.",Condominas E; Riquelme G; Garcia E; Annas P; Narayan VA; de Girolamo G; Preti A; ,IRCCS Instituto Centro San Giovanni di Dio Fatebenefratelli; Davos Alzheimer's collaborative; ; Dipartimento di Neuroscienze; Impact and Prevention of Mental Disorders Research Group; Centros de investigación biomédica en red en el área de bioingeniería; H.

We calculated the percentage of people reaching glucose targets and determined a GRI threshold that could identify patients reaching targets. This was a retrospective study conducted in the CIRDIA, a multisite (n=7) out-of-hospital HCL initiation center. AGP metrics for the 14 previous days were manually extracted from HCL platforms at initiation (M0), 3 ± 1 months (M3) and 6 ± 1 months (M6). PwT1D were considered as reaching efficacy and safety targets (EST) if time-in-range was > 70 %, GMI was < 7 %, time-below-range (TBR) Six-month data were available for 136 persons. The percentage of PwT1D reaching glucose targets at respectively M0, M3 and M6 were for EST: 6.6 %, 40.4 % and 39.7 %. GRI decreased from 56.0 ± 20.9 to 30.1 ± 14.1 and 30.6 ± 13.8. ROC analyses showed that the best GRI value to detect patients who reached EST was GRI <26. A threshold set at this level had very good specificity (92 %) and negative predictive value (93 %) to identify those who do need further intensive support with HCL. Setting a GRI threshold at 26 could be helpful to detect with a single number, potentially automatically calculated by CGM platforms, PwT1D who require further support.",Picard S; Courbebaisse B; Dupont J; Lecornet-Sokol E; Personeni E; Bouché C; Giroud F,Endocrinology and Diabetes; IPE; Rothschild Foundation; CDOM21,docsylviepicard@diabetes21.fr.

Yet, the demand for alternative protein sources is rapidly increasing as a result of population growth, including health and ethical concerns associated with meat consumption. Edible mushroom species contain a high composition of protein, fiber, vitamins, and a variety of minerals, and are regarded as sufficient sources of food products. Pleurotus genus is one of the most extensively studied edible fungi due to its exceptional physical, chemical, biological, and enzymatic properties. The assessment on the effects of the in vitro culture media composition, including carbon and nitrogen sources, pH, and temperature are all necessary for enhancing mushroom mycelial biomass growth and production. Mycoprotein as a fungal-derived protein source has been identified as a more sustainable and healthier meat substitute due to its fibrous structure, high nutritional value, and unique functional profile. Its distinctive production method results in a much lower carbon and water footprint than traditional farming methods. A systemic transition from traditional agriculture to more sustainable cellular agriculture using cell-cultivation methods to create animal products has been proposed and initiated. This review can provide an overview on the various processes involved in the production and usage of mycelium as an alternative protein source in hybrid cell-cultured meat production.",Bartels P,WildBio Company,

The objective of this study was to analyze the oral feeding skills of healthy late preterm, early term, and full-term infants using a neonatal oral feeding monitor. We used the oral feeding parameters reported by NeoSAFE which is a certified medical device, to assess the swallowing and swallow-respiration coordination in newborn infants. Oral feeding parameters were recorded over a 2-minutes long bottle-feeding session. The total swallow count, swallow time, maximum rhythmic swallows, resting interval duration, time between rhythmic swallows and inspiration after swallow count were recorded by NeoSAFE. We planned to examine the relationship of oral feeding parameters according to the gestational age. We also investigated whether the coordination of swallowing and respiration changes with respect to gestational age in newborn infants. A total of 88 infants were included; 34 late preterm, 34 early term, and 20 full term. The gestational age was found to have significant negative correlation with the average time between rhythmic swallows and positive correlation with the swallow time. Feeding volume was found to have a negative correlation with the resting interval duration and average time between rhythmic swallows. It was also found that the feeding volume has a positive correlation with total swallow count, swallow time, maximum rhythmic swallow and inspirium after swallow count. Although the oral feeding skills of infants at 34 weeks gestation are still developing, this study identified differences in oral feeding skills among late preterm, early term, and full-term infants when assessed using a neonatal swallow and respiration detection system. However, conducting larger cohort studies using NeoSAFE would be beneficial for guiding oral feeding approaches in infants. Not applicable.",,,sezinunal@gmail.com.

39918157,A Machine Learning Algorithm to Predict Medical Device Recall by the Food and Drug Administration.,2025-05-06,The western journal of emergency medicine,10.5811/westjem.21238,"Medical device recalls are important to the practice of emergency medicine, as unsafe devices include many ubiquitous items in emergency care, such as vascular access devices, ventilators, infusion pumps, video laryngoscopes, pulse oximetry sensors, and implantable cardioverter defibrillators. Identification of dangerous medical devices as early as possible is necessary to minimize patient harms while avoiding false positives to prevent removal of safe devices from use. While the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) employs an adverse event reporting program (MedWatch) and database (MAUDE), other data sources and methods might have utility to identify potentially dangerous medical devices. Our objective was to evaluate the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of a machine learning (ML) algorithm using publicly available data to predict medical device recalls by the FDA. We identified recalled medical devices (RMD) and non-recalled medical devices (NRMD) using the FDA's website and online database. We constructed an ML algorithm (random forest regressor) that automatically searched Google Trends and PubMed for the RMDs and NRMDs. The algorithm was trained using 400 randomly selected devices and then tested using 100 unique random devices. The algorithm output a continuous value (0-1) for recall probability for each device, which were rounded for dichotomous analysis. We determined sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy for each of three time periods prior to recall (T-3, 6, or 12 months), using FDA recall status as the reference standard. The study adhered to relevant items of the Standards for Reporting Diagnostic accuracy studies (STARD) guidelines. Using a rounding threshold of 0.5, sensitivities for T-3, T-6, and T-12 were 89% (95% confidence interval [CI] 69-97), 90% (95% CI 70-97), and 75% (95% CI 53-89). Specificity was 100% (95% CI 95-100) for all three time periods. Accuracy was 98% (95% CI 93-99) for T-3 and T-6, and 95% (95% CI 89-99) for T-12. Using tailored thresholds yielded similar results. An ML algorithm accurately predicted medical device recall status by the FDA with lead times as great as 12 months. Future research could incorporate longer lead times and data sources including FDA reports and prospectively test the ability of ML algorithms to predict FDA recall.",,,

The adoption of smart inverters is on the rise. Power companies are keen on integrating them into their networks to acquire essential frequency and voltage support as required. These inverters actively exchange actual and reactive power in connection with the grid, altering the system's operational state. This dynamic behavior within the distribution level of power networks might give rise to unprecedented issues. This paper investigates the influence of diverse connection prerequisites that explore the methods for determining the Hosting Capacity (HC) of PV solar systems and their applicability within the low-voltage utility grid. Smart inverters provided with different Volt-VAr and Power Factor (PF) regulation capabilities are analyzed using MATLAB SIMULINK. The outcomes reveal a notable augmentation in the network's HC. This progress improves the grid's attributes, and the incorporation of smart inverter functionalities stands to considerably facilitate incorporating PV solar installations into electrical networks.",,,

While small animal models contain limits for translational research, we aimed to develop an atherosclerosis model with lumen-narrowing plaques to foster basic research in vascular biology, the development of new angioplasty devices, and vessel wall imaging approaches. Endothelial denudation was performed via a minimally invasive approach through the auricular artery, followed by stent-retriever mediated endothelial injury in New Zealand White rabbits (n = 10). Along with a high-fat diet, the rabbits developed lumen-narrowing atherosclerosis and neointimal hyperplasia of the iliac arteries within a 6-week period after mechanical injury.

Using a genetically engineered mouse model of medulloblastoma, we show that FLASH radiation stimulates proinflammatory polarization in tumor macrophages. Single-cell transcriptome analysis shows that FLASH proton beam radiation skews macrophages toward proinflammatory phenotypes and increases T cell infiltration. Furthermore, FLASH radiation reduces peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPARγ) and arginase 1 expression and inhibits immunosuppressive macrophage polarization under stimulus-inducible conditions. Mechanistically, FLASH radiation abrogates lipid oxidase expression and oxidized low-density lipid generation to reduce PPARγ activity, while standard radiation induces reactive oxygen species-dependent PPARγ activation in macrophages. Notably, FLASH radiotherapy improves infiltration and activation of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells and sensitizes medulloblastoma to GD2 CAR-T cell therapy. Thus, FLASH radiotherapy reprograms macrophage lipid metabolism to reverse tumor immunosuppression. Combination FLASH-CAR radioimmunotherapy may offer exciting opportunities for solid tumor treatment.",,,david.kirsch@uhn.ca.

Intermittent redosing is a clinical practice in the setting of nerve catheters, often utilizing large doses. Comparatively, theoretical elimination rates are available from pharmacokinetic studies, providing estimates on total body content of these drugs. The authors hypothesized that published redosing of bupivacaine and ropivacaine in clinical literature comported with safe elimination of the drugs based on pharmacokinetic studies. Clinical redosing of bupivacaine and ropivacaine were identified from previously published articles that used intermittent bolus dosing into the transversus abdominis plane and paravertebral space. The dosing data were fit to an exponential curve using least squares regression and 1/Y 2 weighting with the equation: Y = Y M - (Y M - Y 0 ) * e -k * x , where YM is the maximal dose (175 mg for bupivacaine, 210 mg for ropivacaine), Y0 is the dose at time zero, k is the elimination constant, and x is time. Both minimal ( i.e. , slowest) and average pharmacokinetic elimination constants for ropivacaine and bupivacaine were identified in the published literature. Clinical redosing was compared with pharmacokinetic elimination. The maximal pharmacokinetic half-lives of bupivacaine and ropivacaine were 603 min (range, 154 to 2,970 min; N = 49) and 528 min (range, 204 to 3,276 min; N = 39), respectively. Clinically reported redosing of bupivacaine fit to an exponential curve with k bupi(clinical) = 0.077 h -1 , representing the 53.5th percentile of extracted pharmacokinetic minimal elimination constants. Clinically reported redosing of ropivacaine fit to a curve with k ropi(clinical) = 0.083 h -1 consistent with the 52nd percentile of minimal pharmacokinetic elimination constants. Clinically reported redosing of bupivacaine and ropivacaine in the published literature reflect the slowest pharmacokinetic elimination based on human studies. The combined data without evidence of toxicity permit the authors to make practical recommendations about safe redosing of these agents.",,,

Catheter ablation using thermal energy sources, such as radiofrequency or cryoballoon ablation, has shown greater success in maintaining sinus rhythm compared with drug therapy. However, thermal ablation (TA) is associated with serious complications, such as atrial-esophageal fistula, phrenic nerve palsy, and pulmonary vein stenosis. Pulsed-field ablation (PFA) is an emerging ablation energy source that uses electroporation to selectively target cardiac tissue while sparing adjacent structures such as nerves and blood vessels. Two randomized controlled trials have demonstrated that PFA is comparable to TA in both efficacy and safety at a 1-year follow-up and had shorter procedure times. A review of six meta-analyses consistently showed shorter procedural times for PFA across all studies. Additionally, three out of the four recent studies with large samples reported lower recurrence rates with PFA. Regarding complication rates, four out of four studies showed lower incidences of phrenic nerve injury with PFA, and two out of three studies reported lower rates of esophageal injury with PFA. However, four out of four studies indicated higher incidences of cardiac tamponade with PFA, highlighting the need for caution among early-career operators. Furthermore, careful monitoring is required considering the possible unforeseen complications specific to PFA and the lack of long-term follow-up data. Despite these concerns, PFA shows promise as a safer, more effective, and efficient alternative to TA for AF, particularly as operator experience and device technology continue to advance.",,,

The aim of this scoping review is to understand the extent of current literature on SWs in the HF population and the device's potential to improve disease management. The literature search was performed on PubMed and Embase in March 2024. Inclusion criteria included the use of commercialized SWs, HF diagnosis and peer-reviewed publications. Articles were excluded if the SW was not the study intervention or was part of a broader intervention programme. Reviews, case reports and study protocols were excluded. Of 1200 identified articles, 13 were included in the scoping review, encompassing 1171 patients with HF, and findings were presented in a descriptive summary table. Validity of several SW-collected physiological metrics was assessed against established technologies. Heart rate and step count measures were deemed moderately accurate in the HF population with Fitbit trackers (n = 5 patients, r = 0.54) and Garmin watches [n = 15 patients (mean age: 65.5 ± 12.6 years), concordance correlation coefficient (CCC) = 0.89 for Vivofit 1 and CCC = 0.92 for Vivofit 3], respectively, while calorimetry was the least reliable measurement [n = 19 patients (mean age: 65.1 ± 6.6 years), mean difference to indirect calorimeter: P = 0.01 for Fitbit Charge 2, P = 0.02 for Mio Slice]. Wrist-worn activity trackers were positively received by patients with HF [91.3% of adherence in research setting (n = 70 patients, median age (IQR): 79 years (76-82)), and 64% in real-world environment (n = 14 patients)] and their health-care providers (six cardiologists out of six acknowledged the data's usefulness), although device ownership ranged from 10 to 50% among the HF population. Physical activity information collected from SWs was found to be valuable in assisting cardiologists with their New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class assessment, which is known for its limited objectivity and reproducibility. Multiple studies found that SWs, especially Fitbit devices, successfully identified a pattern where the degree of exercise intolerance increased with higher NYHA classes. These findings suggested that activity trackers can objectively evaluate the severity of physical activity limitations. As the functional classification of patients influences treatment strategies, SWs could serve as a valuable tool to facilitate and optimize outpatient disease management. SWs could be used as a complement to standard monitoring in HF. With continuous technological advances, it will be valuable to follow the deployment of SWs and to investigate their contribution to increased patient safety and consequently to health care cost reductions.",Fabien S; Waechter S; Kayode GA; Müller B; Koehler F,CSL Vifor; Department of Cardiology; CSL Behring,

Twenty workers were randomized into intervention and control groups, performing daily order-picking with and without the BSE, respectively. Effects on muscles activity and kinematics were measured during standardized tasks before and after the intervention period, while work intensity and musculoskeletal discomfort were rated throughout the intervention period. The results indicated significant reductions in back muscle activity during lifting tasks with BSE assistance before and after 24-weeks. Although three BSE users stopped using the exoskeleton during the intervention period, the remaining workers progressively increased their daily BSE use associated with an overall decrease in perceived work intensity throughout the 24-weeks. The trial suggests that the effect of the BSE on back muscle activity remains constant over 24-weeks, opposite what was hypothesized based on previous research on training.",,,lsja@hst.aau.dk.

We have recently reported the clinical efficacy of a novel form of analgesic electrical neuromodulation that uses ultra low frequency (ULF In naïve, neuropathic and sham-operated rats, recordings of ongoing and evoked activity were made from thalamic neurons, targeting the ventral posterolateral (VPL) nucleus. Responses to electrical stimulation of hind limb receptive fields were reduced in 25 of 32 (78%) neurons tested with lumbar epidural ULF neuromodulation. Cells preferentially responsive to low intensity stimulation were more likely to be found than cells responding to a range of stimulus intensities, or high intensity only; and low threshold responses were more likely to be inhibited by ULF than high threshold responses. On-going activity unrelated to hindlimb stimulation, observed in 17 of 39 neurons in naïve animals (44%), was reduced by lumbar epidural ULF current in only 3 of 14 (21%) neurons tested with ULF. By contrast, in rats with a well-characterized neuropathic injury, spinal nerve ligation (SNL), we found a much higher incidence of on-going activity in thalamic neurons: 53 of 55 neurons (96%) displayed firing unrelated to hindlimb stimulation. In this group, ULF current reduced thalamic neurone discharge rate in 19 of 29 (66%) neurons tested. In sham-operated animals, the incidence of such activity in thalamic neurons and the effect of ULF current were not significantly different from the naïve group. We conclude firstly that ULF current can acutely and reversibly interrupt signaling between sensory afferent fibers and relay neurons of the thalamus. Second, ongoing activity of thalamic neurons increases dramatically in the early stages following neuropathic injury. Third, this novel form of neuromodulation preferentially attenuates pathological thalamic activity in this neuropathic model compared to normal activity in naïve and sham-operated animals. This study, therefore, demonstrates that epidural ULF current can reduce nerve injury-related abnormal activity reaching the brain. These findings help advance understanding of possible mechanisms for the analgesic effects of ULF neuromodulation.",Verma N; Harris JP,Presidio Medical Inc.,

Twenty LCUs were assessed using a laboratory-grade wide beam imager to determine the relationship between the beam divergence on the irradiance as a function of distance from the light tip. The irradiance (mW/cm There were significant differences in the power, irradiance, and emission spectra from the 20 LCUs. At 10 mm from the LCU tip, the irradiance delivered by one LCU decreased by approximately 85.7 %, whereas this decrease was as low as 5.6 % for a different LCU. There was a positive correlation between the divergence angle reported by the wide beam imager and the reduction in irradiance. The laser diode LCU had the least beam divergence and the smallest decrease in irradiance as the distance increased. In contrast, the QTH LCU with the turbo light guide had the greatest beam divergence and the greatest reduction in irradiance as the distance increased. 50 % of the LCUs tested would require exposure times longer than 20 s to deliver 10 J/cm The wide beam imager is a useful tool for measuring the beam divergence from LCUs and predicting the effect of distance on their irradiance.

While industry partnerships drive innovation, there is concern that these collaborations may negatively influence patient care. In response, stakeholders have called for increased monitoring of these relationships. This study aims to provide an up-to-date review of the industry payments to neurosurgeons and how COVID-19 has impacted these payments. A retrospective study was performed using data from the Center of Medicare and Medicaid Services Open Payments Database (1/1/19-12/31/23). Neurosurgeons were identified using the taxonomy code, 207T00000X. Data collected included the number of payments, purpose, total value, and mean value per year. From 2019 to 2023, 362,270 industry payments were made to 7,846 unique neurosurgeons for a total of $479,072,106. The most common types of payments were for food and beverage (72.7 %), travel and lodging (15.2 %), consulting fees (5.85 %), royalties and licensing (3.02 %), and services other than consulting (1.86 %), while the largest contributors to total payment value were payments for royalties and licensing (57.6 %), consulting fees (14.5 %), acquisitions (12.8 %), services other than consulting (5.00 %), and travel and lodging (3.89 %). Overall, the total amount paid to neurosurgeons decreased during the COVID-19 years (2020-2021) compared to 2019 but rose again in 2022. Neurosurgeons maintain an active financial partnership with industry. Similar to prior reports, payments related to product development comprised the majority of payment value, while payments for food and beverage were the most common. The years of COVID-19, particularly 2020, had a substantial impact on the number, value amount, and subcategory distribution of industry payments made to neurosurgeons.

Participants shared wearable (Fitbit) data and self-reported questionnaires on depression, anxiety, and mood via a study app. We examined correlations between mental health scores and wearable-derived features, demographics, health variables, and mood assessments. Unsupervised clustering was used to identify behavioural patterns associated with depression and anxiety. Furthermore, we employed XGBoost machine learning models to predict depression and anxiety severity and compared the performance using different subsets of features. We observed significant associations between the severity of depression and anxiety with several factors, including mood, age, gender, BMI, sleep patterns, physical activity, and heart rate. Clustering analysis revealed that participants simultaneously exhibiting lower physical activity levels and higher heart rates reported more severe symptoms.

This real-world evidence study investigated the effect of three OTC headache treatments on headache intensity and the associated impairment of cognitive and functional parameters in headache sufferers in Germany, Brazil, and Japan. This prospective, multinational, observational eDiary-based study included adults experiencing headache for ≥ 6 months, with ≥ 2 headache episodes per month requiring treatment and using one of the three OTC headache treatments (Germany: ibuprofen 400 mg + caffeine 100 mg; Brazil: dipyrone 1 g; Japan: ibuprofen 100 mg + caffeine 40 mg). The primary endpoint was change in headache intensity (11-point numeric rating scale [NRS]) from baseline (headache onset) to 2 h post-treatment. Secondary endpoints were association between NRS scores for headache intensity and for cognitive and functional parameters and change in these parameters from baseline to 2 h post-treatment. Of the 32,623 individuals screened, 1239 were enrolled in the study, with 607 having their first headache episode treated using one of the OTC treatments. Baseline demographics and characteristics were similar across the cohorts. At 2 h post-treatment, headache intensity significantly improved, with the mean change from baseline being 3.4 (3.1, 3.7, 95% confidence interval), 4.2 (3.9, 4.5), and 3.0 (2.7, 3.3) for German, Brazilian, and Japanese cohorts, respectively. Improvement was observed in all cognitive and functional parameters. The NRS score for headache intensity significantly predicted NRS scores of all cognitive and functional parameters (P < 0.0001). The study shows that headache intensity significantly affects cognitive and functional aspects, as well as overall quality of life, for sufferers globally. It confirms the effectiveness of OTC medications and suggests using headache intensity as a self-assessment tool for symptom severity, highlighting the need for new parameters in the OTC domain to improve public health benefits.",Amand C; Colby C; Margolis MK; Polivka V; Stewart A; Constantin L,Opella; AIXIAL Group; PPD,peter.goadsby@kcl.ac.uk.

Density grade class and volumetric breast density distributions were obtained from mammographic images from three different vendor devices in different centers using breast density evaluation software in a retrospective study. Density distributions were compared across devices with a Mann-Whitney U test and breast density thresholds corresponding to distribution percentiles calculated. A method of matching density percentiles is proposed to determine women at potentially high risk while mitigating possible bias due to the device used for screening. 2083 (mean age 59 ± 5.4), 531 (mean age 58.8 ± 5.7) and 244 (mean age 60.7 ± 6.0) screened women were evaluated on three vendor devices, respectively. Both the density grade distribution and the volumetric breast density were different between Vendor 1 and Vendor 2 data (p < 0.001) and between Vendor 1 and Vendor 3 data (p < 0.001). Between Vendor 2 and Vendor 3, no significant difference was observed (p = 0.67 for density grade, p = 0.29 for volumetric density). To recruit the top 10% of women with extremely dense breasts required respective density thresholds of 16.1%, 13.6% and 13.8% for the three vendor devices. Density grade class and volumetric breast density distributions differ between devices grouped by vendor and can result in statistically different breast density distributions. Percentile-dependent density thresholds can ensure unbiased selection of high-risk women. Question Does the use of x-ray systems from different vendors influence breast density evaluation and the resulting selection of high-risk women during breast cancer screening? Findings Statistically significant differences were observed between breast density distributions of different vendors; a method of matching via percentiles is proposed to prevent biased density evaluations. Clinical relevance Measured breast density distributions differed between X-ray devices.

This study examines the effectiveness of a hybrid system integrating nano zerovalent iron (nZVI) and layered double hydroxides (LDH) in treating wastewater contaminated with ciprofloxacin (CIP). Reactor experiments revealed that incorporating nZVI@LDH mitigated the shock caused by CIP while sustaining a methane production rate that was 116 % higher than that of the control group. Furthermore, there was a 50 % increase in CIP removal efficiency. Notably, there was a significant enrichment of hydrogenotrophic methanogens, such as Methanobacterium and Methanolinea, in the nZVI@LDH-enhanced reactors. Additionally, the levels of reactive oxygen species decreased by 50 %, from 11,813 ± 1230 to 4525 ± 1030 counts/s, and the abundance of ARGs declined by 75-88 % compared to the control reactors. An external electric field further promoted electron transfer, boosting the relative abundance of electrochemically active bacteria, with Proteobacteria comprising up to 40 % of the microbial community in the 1 V + nZVI@LDH reactor.

Seven semi-continuously fed digesters were operated for a total of 420 days. To obtain an optimal mixing ratio of the HTL aqueous with other co-substrates, a wide range of parameters were tested on influent and effluent of the digesters with 0.0%-43.3% of the chemical oxygen demand (COD) loading rate of the co-digesters contributed by HTL aqueous. HTL aqueous was generated from mixed sludge (20% total solids) at 350 °C, 170 bar, and 20 min retention time. Thermophilic co-digesters with HTL aqueous contributing to 12.0%, 23.1%, and 43.3% of the total COD load were fully inhibited after 42, 29, and 15 days, respectively, while co-digesters with 1.21% and 2.74% of total COD contribution by HTL aqueous operated without any inhibition over 180 days. Biogas production in the co-digester with 4.89% COD contribution from HTL aqueous was also inhibited after 95 days of operation. This co-digester experienced a complete process failure for 42 days, followed by 218 days of partial (76%) steady inhibition before fully recovered. This indicates that thermophilic cultures can acclimatize to inhibitors in HTL aqueous to a certain extent. High levels of nitrogen heterocyclic compounds, such as pyridines and pyrazines, in HTL aqueous were determined to be the cause of inhibition in co-digesters fed with high volume of HTL aqueous.

Transanal irrigation (TAI) is an emerging treatment with great success in refractory cases. We performed TAI with a substantially decreased amount of water used (low-volume TAI), yet no previous evidence exists on this treatment in children. We conducted this study to evaluate the efficacy of low-volume TAI in reducing faecal incontinence (FI) episodes and to provide associated factors for response. Children with FFI trained in low-volume TAI in our outpatient incontinence clinic were identified. Baseline characteristics along with rectal ultrasound examination, information on weekly FI episodes and concomitant use of laxatives were noted. The continence status of patients was registered at the first outpatient clinic appointment after the commencement of TAI and after 6 months of treatment. During this period, information about side effects and changes in medication were captured. We identified 47 children (mean age 8.06 ± 2.08 years, 27 males) treated with low-volume TAI. Thirty-five (74%) were diagnosed with functional constipation and FI, while 12 (26%) suffered from non-retentive faecal incontinence. Twenty (42%) children gained full faecal continence after 6.75 ± 0.3 months. We found no differences between responders and non-responders in baseline characteristics. Low-volume TAI appears safe and effective in the treatment of FFI refractory to first-line treatment in children.

However, most photoacoustic and ultrasound imaging systems rely on linear-array transducers with elevational focusing and are limited to two-dimensional imaging with anisotropic resolutions. Here, we present three-dimensional diffractive acoustic tomography (3D-DAT), which uses an off-the-shelf linear-array transducer with single-slit acoustic diffraction. Without jeopardizing its accessibility by general users, 3D-DAT has achieved simultaneous 3D photoacoustic and ultrasound imaging with optimal imaging performance in deep tissues, providing near-isotropic resolutions, high imaging speed, and a large field-of-view, as well as enhanced quantitative accuracy and detection sensitivity. Moreover, powered by the fast focal line volumetric reconstruction, 3D-DAT has achieved 50-fold faster reconstruction times than traditional photoacoustic imaging reconstruction. Using 3D-DAT on small animal models, we mapped the distribution of the biliverdin-binding serpin complex in glassfrogs, tracked gold nanoparticle accumulation in a mouse tumor model, imaged genetically-encoded photoswitchable tumors, and investigated polyfluoroalkyl substances exposure on developing embryos. With its enhanced imaging performance and high accessibility, 3D-DAT may find broad applications in fundamental life sciences and biomedical research.",Delia J,American Museum of Natural History,tuan.vodinh@duke.edu.

39879719,Comparison of linear mixed models for genetic feather score analysis in laying hens kept in recurrent testing facilities.,2025-03-11,Poultry science,10.1016/j.psj.2025.104833,"Feather pecking, related feather damage, and mortality are crucial welfare and efficiency traits in laying hens. When individuals are kept in sib groups, genetic analysis of feather scores captures the performer and receiver components of feather damage due to pecking. Genetic parameters and breeding values estimated from such data with an ordinary linear mixed model refer to total breeding values. Thus, breeding against feather pecking-related mortality is possible by selecting breeding values for feather score when these are estimated from sib-groups. ""Feather score"" is part of the selection indexes of some breeding companies. However, there is no public information on the extensive evaluation and validation of the models used. Moreover, survival and feather score are genetically correlated, potentially biasing feather score-breeding value and genetic parameters estimation. This study compared and validated six models for genetic analysis of feather scores in the back and neck regions of laying hens at 45 and 70 weeks of age. We tested univariate models of feather score along with bivariate models for feather score and survival, and both sire and animal models, using individual or cage-level records. We compared the performance of the models based on the accuracy and dispersion of estimated breeding values. Additionally, genetic variances for all traits were estimated and compared. The individual-level univariate animal model showed the poorest performance for both accuracy and dispersion. Apart from the previous, no clear superiority regarding accuracy was observed between animal and sire models, nor between univariate and bivariate models. Breeding values estimated from cage-level observations tended to show less over-dispersion, and the estimates from the univariate cage-level sire model showed no significant over-dispersion for all traits. Since the univariate cage-level sire model was the simplest, as accurate as any of the other models, and showed no over-dispersion, it was considered the best model for feather score analysis with recurrent testing data.",,,tzayhri.osoriogallardo@wur.nl.

Conducting the 6MWT can be challenging when patients cannot visit the clinic due to physical/travel limitations. This pilot study assessed the feasibility of conducting the 6MWT using wearable sensors for patients with transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy. Participants were enrolled in the phase 3 ATTRibute-CM trial. Sensors were positioned on patients' feet and lower back during the 6MWT. The 6-minute walk distance (6MWD) was compared with the distance measured by a trained observer during a concurrent conventional test. Pearson and concordance correlation coefficients were estimated. Twelve participants from five centers participated; 11 had evaluable data. Mean 6MWD was 330.3 m (conventional method) and 335.1 m (wearable sensors); mean difference (SD) was 4.7 m (10.95). Pearson and concordance correlation coefficients for 6MWD were 0.998 (95% CI: 0.992-0.999) and 0.997 (95% CI: 0.991-0.999), respectively. The 6MWD measured using wearable sensors and by the conventional method were closely correlated. Conducting the 6MWT with wearable sensors may be feasible and as reliable as the conventional method in a monitored clinic setting. Whether at-home 6MWD measured by wearable sensors correlates with in-clinic monitoring deserves further study. ClinicalTrials.gov identifier is NCT03860935. The 6-minute walk test (6MWT) assesses the ability of a person to do physical exercise by measuring the distance walked in 6 minutes. It is commonly used in clinical trials involving patients with heart disease. The recent COVID-19 pandemic exposed the potential for clinical trials to be disrupted by unforeseen circumstances. During the pandemic, patients were unable to travel to hospitals or physician offices to take part in clinical trial visits. In this study, scientists tested whether wearable sensors can be used to measure the distance walked during a 6MWT with the idea that this technology could eventually be used to remotely monitor a patient doing the 6MWT at home. The study included 12 patients with transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy, a condition where a protein called transthyretin builds up in the heart muscle and disrupts its normal function, leading to heart failure. Wearable sensors were put on the feet and lower back of the patients during the 6MWT. The distance the patient walked when wearing the sensor was compared with the distance walked during the normal 6MWT. The results showed that the distances measured by the sensors and by the usual test were very similar. This means that it might be possible to use wearable sensors for the 6MWT, and that there may be a potential to carry out the test without the need for in-person clinic visits. Additional studies in more patients and in real-life settings are required to confirm these results.",Sowalsky K; Bai Y; Du J; Katz L; Siddhanti S; Fox JC,APDM Wearable Technologies; BridgeBio Pharma,

Consecutive adults with glaucoma and ab-externo GS implantation (with/without phacoemulsification or open/closed conjunctiva) ≥12 months before study entry. Data were extracted between the baseline/preoperative and last follow-up visit or date of secondary surgical intervention (SSI). Primary effectiveness endpoint: proportion of primary eyes (first eye in bilaterally implanted patients) at month 12 (M12) achieving ≥20% intraocular pressure (IOP) reduction from baseline without medication increase, clinical hypotony, vision loss to counting fingers, or SSI. Secondary effectiveness endpoints included complete success (IOP ≤18 mm Hg and ≥20% IOP reduction from medicated baseline without medication, clinical hypotony, or SSI); qualified success (same but without medication increase); and needling rate. Key safety endpoints (all eyes): intraoperative complications, postoperative adverse events (AEs), and SSIs. The safety population included 466 eyes; 80.7% received the GS alone and 85.0% were implanted with closed conjunctiva. At M12, 39.1% of all primary eyes (N=413) and 54.9% of primary eyes with IOP and medication data at baseline and M12 (N=213) achieved the primary endpoint. At M12 among all primary eyes, the complete success, qualified success, and needling rates were 33.5%, 56.5%, and 28.6%. Most eyes (97.9%) had no intraoperative complications.

39872090,Establishing an Electrophysiological Recording Platform for Epidural Spinal Cord Stimulation in Neuropathic Pain Rats.,,Journal of pain research,10.2147/JPR.S489420,"Spinal cord stimulation (SCS) is pivotal in treating chronic intractable pain. To elucidate the mechanism of action among conventional and current novel types of SCSs, a stable and reliable electrophysiology model in the consensus animals to mimic human SCS treatment is essential. We have recently developed a new in vivo implantable pulsed-ultrahigh-frequency (pUHF) SCS platform for conducting behavioral and electrophysiological studies in rats. However, some technical details were not fully understood. This study comprehensively analyzed methodology and technical challenges and pitfalls encountered during the development and implementation of this model. Employing a newly developed pUHF-SCS (±3 V, 2 Hz pulses with 500-kHz biphasic radiofrequency sinewaves), we assessed analgesic effect and changes of evoked local field potentials (eLFPs) in the bilateral primary somatosensory and anterior cingulate cortices in the rats with or without spared nerve injury (SNI) using the platform. The placement of stimulating needle electrodes in the hind paw was examined and optimized for functionality. SNI enhanced the C component of eLFPs in bilateral cortexes elicited by stimulating the contralateral but not the ipsilateral lateral aspect of the hind paw. Repeated pUHF-SCS significantly reversed SNI-induced paw hypersensitivity and reduced C-component enhancement. An impedance test can determine an optimal SCS electrode function: an SCS discharge threshold of 100-400 μA for cortical activation or a motor threshold of 150-600 μA for the hind limbs. Impedance increased due to growth of fibrotic tissue but stabilized after post-implantation day 12. We presented a reliable electrophysiological platform for SCS application in rat neuropathic pain model and demonstrated potent analgesic effects of pUHF-SCS. All device implantations or pUHF-SCS per se did not cause evident spinal cord damage. This safe and stable platform provides an in vivo rat model for SCS investigation of mechanisms of action and device innovation.",Lin WT; Lu KH,Gimer Medical Co.,

There are currently no licensed vaccines or therapeutics. A lipopeptide-based fusion inhibitor was developed and previously evaluated for efficacy against the NiV-Malaysia strain. Intraperitoneal administration in hamsters showed superb prophylactic activity and promising efficacy, however the intratracheal delivery mode in non-human primates proved intractable and spurred the development of an aerosolized delivery route that could be clinically applicable. We developed an aerosol delivery system in an artificial respiratory 3D model and optimized the combinations of flow rate and particle size for lung deposition. We characterized the nebulizer device and assessed the safety of lipopeptide nebulization in an African green monkey model that mimics human NiV infection. Three nebulized doses of fusion-inhibitory lipopeptide were administered every 24 h, resulting in peptide deposition across multiple regions of both lungs without causing toxicity or adverse hematological and biochemical effects. In peptide-treated monkeys challenged with a lethal dose of NiV-Bangladesh, animals retained robust levels of T and B-lymphocytes in the blood, infection-induced lethality was significantly delayed, and 2 out of 5 monkeys were protected from NiV infection. The present study establishes the safety and feasibility of the nebulizer delivery method for AGM studies.

Importantly, this growth raises concerns about postoperative infections, which present significant challenges within our healthcare system and lead to a two-thirds failure rate for infected implants. In this study, we present an innovative multilevel coating system that makes the surface of dental titanium implants resistant to bacterial colonization, thereby minimizing the risk of infection development. This multilevel coating features a nanometer-thick biohybrid coating layer combined with a microgroove surface microstructuring, creating physical barriers that enhance the stability of the biohybrids against mechanical abrasion. Our coating demonstrates excellent biocompatibility and strong antifouling properties against undiluted blood plasma proteins. Furthermore, the combination of surface microstructuring and the biohybrid coating remains stable under prolonged mechanical stress simulation and effectively repels clinically relevant bacteria, achieving a 99% reduction in bacterial colonization on the implant. These findings underscore the potential of this approach to prevent implant-associated infections and highlight the critical role of surface engineering in ensuring long-term implant performance.",,,

Proactive treatment options remain limited, which is exacerbated by a lack of sensitive and convenient diagnostics, especially early in disease progression or specifically to assess small fiber neuropathy (SFN), the loss of distal small diameter axons that innervate tissues and organs. We designed, fabricated, tested, and validated a first-of-its-kind medical diagnostic device for the functional assessment of transdermal small fiber nerve activity. This device, the Detecting Early Neuropathy (DEN), is an electrically conductive needle array designed to record nerve electrical activity in the skin and subdermal tissues, as a feature of a broader theragnostic platform. DEN recordings were validated across a time course of diet-induced PN in mice, using statistical and computational analyses and compared to other SFN measures. Based on these preclinical mouse data, the device design was adapted to obtain recordings in human with a flexible printed circuit board to mold to the leg or other skin regions. The DEN successfully recorded various types of neural activity in mouse and human, with or without stimulation, including validated action potentials and electromyography signals. New functional diagnostic tools like DEN offer a promising outlook for patients needing an earlier or more sensitive diagnosis of DPN/SFN, to allow for earlier and more effective treatment options, especially as more become available in the clinic in future years.",,,

Elevated IAP can reduce visceral perfusion, lead to intraabdominal hypertension, and result in life-threatening abdominal compartment syndrome. While ingestible capsular devices have been used for various abdominal diagnoses, their application in continuous IAP monitoring remains unproven. We conducted a prospective clinical trial to evaluate the feasibility of IAP measurement using a digital capsule PressureDOT, an ingestible capsule equipped with wireless transmission capability and a pressure sensor, then compared its reliability with conventional intravesical method. Patients undergoing laparoscopic or robotic surgeries were recruited. During surgery, we created pneumoperitoneum by inflating CO2 into the peritoneal cavity and IAP was simultaneously monitored using both the ingestible capsules and intravesical measurements from Foley catheter. We assessed the feasibility of signal transmission and the accuracy of pressure measurements. Six patients were enrolled in this pilot study. No adverse events were reported, and the average first-intake time was within 24 h. All capsules were successfully expelled, with an average excretion time of 81 h. In the summarized data, the mean IAPdot is 0.6 mmHg lower than the IAPivp, with a standard deviation of 1.68 mmHg.

This study aims to investigate the gender pay gap in industry general nonresearch payments made to U.S. general and fellowship-trained surgeons between 2016 and 2022. Data on industry payments to U.S. surgeons were collected from the open payments database. General and fellowship-trained surgeons were included. Gender prediction was conducted using an artificial intelligence tool. Payment type, amount, and company were summarized. Gender differences were compared. Between 2016 and 2022, the medical and device industry made 1,998,110 payments totaling $739,264,940 to U.S. general and fellowship-trained surgeons. The median payment was $31, primarily for food and beverages. Surgeons receiving over $5000 annually accounted for $634,530,579 (86%). Most payments were device-related (92%). Intuitive ($199M), Medtronic ($57M), and Boston Scientific ($46M) were the top-paying companies. California received the highest payments ($90M).

Prostate cancer typically has few tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, which are crucial for antitumor immunity. This study investigated the use of HIFU to increase lymphocyte infiltration into the tumor and enhance antitumor immunity. RM1 prostate tumors were implanted onto both flanks of syngeneic C57BL/6 J mice, with one tumor subjected to HIFU treatment. The growth of the contralateral tumor was monitored. Blood samples were obtained from patients both before and after prostatectomy or HIFU treatment. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were then isolated to analyze the immune cells. In murine experiments, the application of HIFU to one tumor decreased the growth of the contralateral (non-HIFU treated) tumor, when the contralateral tumor was the same tumor type, but not when it was a different tumor type. HIFU increased infiltration of CD4+ and CD8+ lymphocytes into the contralateral, same-type tumor. Lymphocyte depletion studies affirmed that the antitumor immune response triggered by HIFU relies on CD4+ and CD8+ lymphocytes. Addition of cholesterol-lowering intervention further increased antitumor immunity generated by HIFU in mice. In human subjects, HIFU, but not prostatectomy, stimulated anti-tumor CD4+ and CD8+ lymphocytes. We concluded that HIFU induced a potent cellular antitumor immune response that inhibited the progression of murine prostate tumors. HIFU stimulated tumor-specific cellular immunity in patients. Future clinical trials should explore the clinical benefits of HIFU, possibly in combination with existing immunotherapies, as immune modulators for both localized and metastatic disease.",,,kimhl@cshs.org.
39860957,Compact Quantum Cascade Laser-Based Noninvasive Glucose Sensor Upgraded with Direct Comb Data-Mining.,2025-05-03,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",10.3390/s25020587,"Mid-infrared spectral analysis has long been recognized as the most accurate noninvasive blood glucose measurement method, yet no practical compact mid-infrared blood glucose sensor has ever passed the accuracy benchmark set by the USA Food and Drug Administration (FDA): to substitute for the finger-pricking glucometers in the market, a new sensor must first show that 95% of their glucose measurements have errors below 15% of these glucometers. Although recent innovative exploitations of the well-established Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy have reached such FDA accuracy benchmarks, an FTIR spectrometer is too bulky. The advancements of quantum cascade lasers (QCLs) can lead to FTIR spectrometers of reduced size, but compact QCL-based noninvasive blood glucose sensors are not yet available. This work reports on two compact sensor system designs, both reaching the FDA accuracy benchmark. Each design commonly comprises a mid-infrared QCL for emission, a multiple attenuation total reflection prism (MATR) for data acquisition, and a computer-controlled infrared detector for data analysis. The first design translates the comb-like signals into conventional spectra, and then data-mines the resultant spectra to yield blood glucose concentrations. When a pressure actuator is employed to press the patient's hypothenar against the MATR, the sensor accuracy is considered to reach the FDA accuracy benchmark. The second design abandons the data processing step of translating combs-to-spectra and directly data-mines the ""first-hand"" comb signal. Beyond increasing the measurement accuracy to the FDA accuracy benchmark, even without a pressure actuator, direct comb data-mining upgrades the sensor system with speed and data integrity, which can impact the healthcare of diabetic patients. Specifically, the sensor performance is validated with 492 glucose absorption scans in the time domain, each with 20 million datapoints measured from four subjects with glucose concentrations of 3.9-7.9 mM. The sensor data-mines 164 sets of critical singularity strengths, each comprising 4 critical singularity strengths directly from the 9840 million raw signal datapoints, and the 656 critical singularity strengths are subjected to a machine-learning regression model analysis, which yields 164 glucose concentrations.

A novel continuous non-invasive arterial pressure monitoring device using a pulse contour algorithm (Pulse Decomposition Analysis), Vitalstream™, is approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration for use in adults. In this study the performance and accuracy of the device compared to intraarterial blood pressure monitoring were assessed in children ages 2-17 undergoing major surgeries. We report the results using comparison to aspects of the recently published ISO 81060-3:2022 standard for continuous automated blood pressure measurement. 31 children ages 2-17 years scheduled for major surgery requiring invasive arterial blood pressure monitoring were consented to participate. Systolic, diastolic, and mean arterial blood pressure readings were obtained from both systems during at least thirty minutes of simultaneous monitoring during hemodynamically stable periods of the surgical procedure and statistically compared. The correlations of systolic and, diastolic, and mean arterial pressures were, respectively, 0.77, 0.68 and 0.7. The Bland-Altman comparisons yielded bias of -3.79 (9.74) mmHg, 1.72 (8.45) mmHg and 2.41 (8.75) mmHg respectively, for systolic, diastolic, and mean arterial pressures, (p < 0.001 for all comparisons). Concordances for systole, diastole and MAP were, respectively, 0.82, 0.85 and 0.83. Most values fell within +/-20mmhg of the corresponding arterial line values.

Although RAM combined with erlotinib (ERL) is known to have clinical benefits, the benefits in patients with baseline brain metastases remain unclear. This report examined the long-term follow-up data (Japan Registry of Clinical Trials: jRCTs2051190027) of the same patients, analyzing relevant biomarkers from tumor and plasma samples. The six patients enrolled in the RELAY-Brain trial received RAM plus ERL or osimertinib (OSM). Our long-term follow-up observational study assessed patient survival, treatment status, and genetic biomarkers. Tumor and plasma samples were analyzed at baseline, during treatment, and at disease progression using next-generation sequencing and droplet digital PCR, to identify gene alterations and EGFR-TKI-resistant mutations. After median follow-up of 44.2 months, the first site of disease progression in three of the patients was the brain metastases.

We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess and compare the prevalence of SIBO among CLD patients (with and without with complications of end stage liver disease) and healthy controls. Electronic databases were searched from inception up to July-2024 for case-control studies reporting SIBO in CLD. Prevalence rates, odds ratios (ORs), and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of SIBO in patients with CLD and controls were calculated utilizing a random-effects model. The protocol was prospectively registered with PROSPERO (CRD42022379578). The final dataset included 34 case-control studies with 2130 CLD patients and 1222 controls. Overall, the odds for SIBO prevalence in CLD patients compared to controls was 6.7 (95% CI 4.6-9.7, p < 0.001). Although the prevalence of SIBO among patients with CLD with cirrhosis was higher at 42.9% (95% CI: 35.9-50.2) compared to 36.9% (95% CI: 27.4-47.6) in those without cirrhosis, this difference failed statistical significance. However, CLD patients with decompensated cirrhosis had a significantly higher prevalence of SIBO compared to those with compensated cirrhosis, with an OR of 2.6 (95% CI: 1.5-4.5, p < 0.001). Additionally, the prevalence of SIBO was significantly higher in CLD patients with portal hypertension (PHT) than in those without PHT, with an OR of 2.1 (95% CI: 1.4-3.1, p < 0.001). The highest prevalence of SIBO was observed in patients with spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) (57.7%, 95% CI 38.8-74.5), followed by patients with hepatic encephalopathy (41.0%, 95% CI 16.0-72.3) and patients with variceal bleed (39.5%, 95% CI 12.1-75.6). Overall, there is a significantly increased prevalence of SIBO in CLD patients compared to controls. The prevalence is even higher in CLD patients with PHT, especially those with SBP.

Typically, simultaneous access to both optical and electrical signals requires separate probes, while their integration into a single device can result in the emergence of photogenerated electrical artifacts, affecting the quality of high-frequency neural recordings. Among the nontrivial strategies aimed at the realization of an implantable multifunctional interface, the integration of optical and electrical capabilities on a single, minimally invasive, tapered optical fiber probe has been recently demonstrated using fibertrodes. Fibertrodes require the application of a set of planar microfabrication techniques to a nonplanar system with low and nonconstant curvature radius. Here we develop a process based on multiple conformal depositions, nonplanar two-photon lithography and chemical wet etching steps to obtain metallic patterns on the highly curved surface of the fiber taper. We detail the manufacturing, encapsulation and back end of the fibertrodes. The design of the probe can be adapted for different experimental requirements. Using the optical setup design, it is possible to perform angle selective light coupling with the fibertrodes and their implantation and use in vivo. The fabrication of fibertrodes is estimated to require 5-9 d. Nonetheless, due to the high scalability of a large part of the protocol, the manufacture of multiple fibertrodes simultaneously substantially reduces the required time for each probe. The procedure is suitable for users with expertise in microfabrication of electronics and neural recordings.",Pisanello M,OptogeniX S.r.l.,antonio.balena@iit.it.

EAB sensors are fabricated by depositing a thiol-modified, target-binding aptamer on the surface of a gold electrode, followed by backfilling with an alkanethiol to form a self-assembled monolayer. And while the majority of previously described EAB sensors have employed hydroxyl-terminated monolayers, a handful of studies have shown that altering the monolayer headgroup can strongly affect sensor performance. Here, using 4 different EAB sensors, we show that the mixed monolayers composed of mixtures of 6-carbon hydroxyl-terminated thiols and varying amounts of either 6- or 8-carbon, carboxylate-terminated thiols lead to improved EAB sensor performance. Specifically, the use of such mixed monolayers enhances the signal gain (the relative change in the signal seen upon target addition) for all tested sensors, often by several fold, both in buffer and whole blood at room temperature or physiological temperatures. Moreover, these improvements in gain are achieved without significant changes in the aptamer affinity or the stability of the resulting sensors. In addition to proving a ready means of improving EAB sensor performance, these results suggest that exploration of the chemistry of the electrode surface employed in such sensors could prove to be a fruitful means of advancing this unique in vivo sensing technology.",,,

In individuals with NC (mean [SD] age, 68.6 [8.9] years; 5664 [58.2%] female; 3002 [34.0%] APOE ε4 carriers; 937 [9.6%] had depressive symptoms; 2648 [27.2%] had amyloid pathology), the presence of depressive symptoms was not associated with amyloid pathology (odds ratio [OR], 1.13; 95% CI, 0.90-1.40; P = .29). In individuals with MCI (mean [SD] age, 70.2 [8.7] years; 1481 [49.0%] female; 1046 [44.8%] APOE ε4 carriers; 824 [27.3%] had depressive symptoms; 1668 [55.8%] had amyloid pathology), the presence of depressive symptoms was associated with a lower likelihood of amyloid pathology (OR, 0.73; 95% CI 0.61-0.89; P = .001). When considering subgroup effects, in individuals with NC, the presence of depressive symptoms was associated with a higher frequency of amyloid pathology in APOE ε4 noncarriers (mean difference, 5.0%; 95% CI 1.0-9.0; P = .02) but not in APOE ε4 carriers. This was not the case in individuals with MCI. Depressive symptoms were not consistently associated with a higher frequency of amyloid pathology in participants with NC and were associated with a lower likelihood of amyloid pathology in participants with MCI. These findings were not influenced by age, sex, or education level.

In the Nurotron CI system, extracting the ECAP waveform from the stimulus artifact is time-consuming. We developed a new paradigm (""FastCAP"") for use with Nurotron CI devices. In electrically evoked compound action potential in fast mode (FastCAP), N recordings are averaged directly on the CI hardware before data transmission, significantly reducing data transmission time. FastCAPs and ECAPs were measured across five electrodes and four stimulation levels per electrode. The FastCAP stimulation rate (33.3 Hz) is also faster than the ECAP rate (2.5 Hz). Results showed strong correlations between ECAPs and FastCAPs for N1 latency ( This preliminary evaluation suggests that the FastCAP could be an effective clinical tool to optimize CI processor settings (e.g., threshold stimulation levels) in users of the Nurotron CI device.",,,

However, the need for long-term intervention can represent a significant burden on patients. Here, we demonstrate that motor imagery (MI) instructions for BMI training, when supplemented with somatosensory stimulation in addition to conventional verbal instructions, can help enhance MI capabilities of healthy participants. Sixteen participants performed MI during scalp EEG signal acquisition before and after somatosensory stimulation to assess MI-induced cortical excitability, as measured using the event-related desynchronization (ERD) of the sensorimotor rhythm (SMR). The non-dominant left hand was subjected to neuromuscular electrical stimulation above the sensory threshold but below the motor threshold (St-NMES), along with passive movement stimulation using an exoskeleton. Participants were randomly divided into an intervention group, which received somatosensory stimulation, and a control group, which remained at rest without stimulation. The intervention group exhibited a significant increase in SMR-ERD compared to the control group, indicating that somatosensory stimulation contributed to improving MI ability. This study demonstrates that somatosensory stimulation, combining electrical and mechanical stimuli, can improve MI capability and enhance the excitability of the sensorimotor cortex in healthy individuals.",,,

Here it is shown that an additional parameter is how drug-releasing microparticles affect the material properties of the scaffold. A microfluidic platform is used to create all-trans retinoic acid (atRA) polycaprolactone (PCL) microparticles with a high encapsulation efficiency (85.9 ± 5.0%), and incorporate them into fibrin constructs to investigate their effect on the material properties. An encapsulation that is around 25-35% higher than the current state of the art batch methods is achieved. It is also found that the drug loading concentration affects the microparticle size, which can be controlled using the microfluidic platform. It is shown that the release of atRA is slower in fibrin constructs than in buffer, and that the presence of atRA in the microparticles modulates both the degradation and the rheological properties of the constructs. Finally, it is shown that the fibrin material exhibits a stronger solid-like state in the presence of atRA-PCL microparticles. These findings establish a basis for understanding the interplay between drug-releasing microparticles and scaffold materials, paving the way for bioinks that achieve tailored degradation and mechanical properties, together with sustained drug delivery for tissue engineering applications.",,,

The key component of this system is a humidity sensor that integrates a thermistor and a micro-heater. This sensor employs porous nanoforests as its sensing material, achieving a sensitivity of 0.56 pF/%RH within a range of 60-90% RH, along with excellent long-term stability and superior gas selectivity. The micro-heater in the device provides a high operating temperature, enhancing sensitivity by 5.8 times. This significant improvement enables the capture of weak humidity variations in exhaled gases, while the thermistor continuously monitors the sensor's temperature during use and provides crucial temperature information related to respiration. With the assistance of a machine learning algorithm, a behavior recognition system based on the humidity sensor has been constructed, enabling behavior states to be classified and identified with an accuracy of up to 96.2%. This simple yet intelligent method holds great potential for widespread applications in medical assistance analysis and daily health monitoring.",,,zhouna@ime.ac.cn.

While the absence of the umbilicus can be aesthetically undesirable for patients, umbilical reconstruction is rarely performed due to the perceived complexity and increased risk of wound infections (Sakata et al. in Colorectal Dis 23:1153-1157, 2021). This study aims to evaluate the outcomes, cosmetic results and patient satisfaction of umbilical reconstruction during cytoreductive surgery. Consecutive patients from a prospectively maintained database who underwent cytoreductive surgery with umbilical excision and reconstruction were evaluated. Our technique for umbilical reconstruction involved recreating the subcutaneous fat space and fashioning umbilical skin flaps that anchor to the anterior fascia. Outcomes assessed included post-operative infection rate, wound dehiscence, seroma formation, wound appearance and patient satisfaction. Umbilical reconstruction was performed on 50 patients, with 12 (24%) experiencing wound-related complications. Of these, eight patients (16%) had superficial wound infections, while one patient (2%) developed a deep wound infection; three patients (6%) required local wound drainage, though none needed surgical revision. There were no reports of wound seromas, skin necrosis, wound widening nor umbilical stenosis. All patients reported satisfaction with the outcome of their reconstruction. Our novel technique for umbilical reconstruction during cytoreductive surgery did not negatively impact wound healing outcomes. Recreating the umbilicus improved cosmetic results and patient satisfaction, enhancing body image for those undergoing major abdominal surgery. This approach should be considered for patients undergoing major laparotomies that necessitates umbilical excision.",,,ernest.cheng1@unsw.edu.au.

SPIROMICS-HF is a cross-sectional study evaluating cardiopulmonary interactions in COPD from December 2019 to April 2024. Two-dimensional coronal real-time cine pulmonary MRI (3.2 frames/sec) was performed during MPT twice. Lung masks and lung MR images from an independent study were used for transfer learning to segment real-time cine pulmonary MR images. Dynamic hyperinflation was evaluated as the increase in end-expiratory lung volume (EELV) during tidal breathing to the end of MPT. Repeatability was assessed with intraclass correlation coefficients, and multivariable associations with COPD severity were examined. Results Of the 70 participants (mean age, 67 years ± 10 [SD]; 37 male, 33 female) included in the study, 59% had COPD. The transfer learning model achieved high accuracy in lung segmentation (Dice similarity coefficient, 0.94 ± 0.03).

They are considered essential to establish definitive evidence of efficacy and safety for new drugs, and whenever possible they should also be the preferred method for investigating new high-risk medical devices. Well-designed studies robustly inform clinical practice guidelines and decision-making, but administrative obstacles have made it increasingly difficult to conduct informative RCTs. The obstacles are compounded for RCTs of high-risk medical devices by extra costs related to the interventional procedure that is needed to implant the device, challenges with willingness to randomize patients throughout a trial, and difficulties in ensuring proper blinding even with sham procedures. One strategy that may help is to promote the wider use of simpler and more streamlined RCTs using data that are collected routinely during healthcare delivery. Recent large simple RCTs have successfully compared the performance of drugs and of high-risk medical devices, against alternative treatments; they enrolled many patients in a short time, limited costs, and improved efficiency, while also achieving major impact. From a task conducted within the CORE-MD project, we report from our combined experience of designing and conducting large pharmaceutical trials during the COVID-19 pandemic, and of planning and coordinating large registry-based RCTs of cardiovascular devices. We summarize the essential principles and utility of large simple RCTs, likely applicable to all interventions but especially in order to promote their wider adoption to evaluate new medical devices.",,,sergio.buccheri@medsci.uu.se.

In Finland, where EM was formally recognised as a specialty as recently as in 2013, a historical lack of systematic training for POCUS has existed. Such training has largely depended on individual initiative rather than a standardised program while many other areas of EM training have already seen the introduction of structured education. The aim of this study is to identify key factors and barriers influencing POCUS training, with the goal of improving its quality and delivery. A nationwide survey was conducted among emergency physicians, trainees, and specialists across Finnish emergency departments from late 2020 to early 2021. The survey included detailed questions on POCUS training, perceived barriers to training, experiences of the successful initiation of more structured approaches, as well as attitudes towards the integration of POCUS into clinical practice. Statistical methods for quantitative data and thematic analysis for qualitative data were used. A total of 134 emergency physicians completed the survey, revealing a strong consensus among participants for several training needs. Key barriers identified include inadequate training, limited supervision, device availability, and time allocation. Notably, out of all open-ended questions, 96.5% of respondents called for the initiation of structured training programs that accommodate both foundational and advanced practitioner needs. Furthermore, hands-on training and senior support were highly valued. The results highlight a need for reform in POCUS training in Finland, demonstrating a need for structured, competency-based educational frameworks that align with international standards. Improvements on training infrastructure, including enhanced mentorship and increased access to ultrasound equipment, are essential enablers of such a reform. Not applicable.",,,jejjar@utu.fi.

Its potential favorable risk-benefit ratio stems from its lack of side effects and significant medical risks, applicability to any anatomic location, long treatment duration, and ease of application by simply affixing it with tape. Even with a relatively small treatment effect, PSWT might contribute to a multimodal analgesic regimen, similar to acetaminophen. However, widespread clinical use is hindered by a lack of systematic evidence. The current randomized, controlled pilot study was undertaken to determine the feasibility and optimize the protocol for a subsequent definitive investigation and estimate the treatment effect of PSWT on postoperative pain and opioid consumption. Within the recovery room following primary knee and hip arthroplasty, cholecystectomy, hernia repair, and non-mastectomy breast surgery, we applied 1-3 PSWT devices (Model 088, BioElectronics Corporation, Frederick, Maryland) over the surgical bandages. Participants were randomized to 28 days of either active or sham treatment in a double-masked fashion. The outcomes of primary interest were the cumulative opioid consumption and the mean of the ""average"" and ""worst"" daily pain measured with the Numeric Rating Scale over the first 7 postoperative days.

Patient data and prosthetic parameters were registered. The minimum thickness of restorations was measured in 15 patients. The Kaplan-Meier survival rate of restorations at 9 years was 98.4 % (100 % for anterior and 96.7 % for posterior) and the success rate was 79.7 %, while the success rate excluding minor chipping requiring only polishing as failure was 86.7 %. Actually, minor chipping was the leading cause of failure and significantly more fractures were observed in the posterior region (9.2 times higher risk), particularly in the first and second molars or when the restoration thickness was less than 0.56 mm. Except for fracture, FDI evaluation showed clinically acceptable results for all restorations, mostly rated as excellent. Results remained consistent over time, including material luster and color, with no staining. MC showed superior esthetics compared to MO. Patient satisfaction was high. The One-Step No-Prep technique exhibits successful long-term outcomes, and PICN (hybrid ceramic) is an appropriate material for this non-invasive treatment of tooth wear.

This review analyzed existing FBGC literature identified through a search string and sources from FBGC articles to evaluate the most commonly used methods and highlight the challenges in establishing a standardized protocol. Our findings revealed a fragmented research landscape marked by significant variability in in vitro culture conditions, i.e., cell origin and type, culture media and sera, fusion-inducing factors, seeding density, culture surface, and inconsistencies in the read-outs. This complicates efforts toward standardization and hampers cross-study comparisons. Based on these results, we highlight the need and propose guidelines for standardized culture protocols for FBGC research.

HER2-targeted therapies have shown clinical activity against these tumor types, resulting in regulatory approvals. However, the efficacy of HER2 therapies in tumors with HER2 mutations has not been widely investigated. SGNTUC-019 is an open-label, phase 2 basket study evaluating tucatinib, a HER2-targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor, in combination with trastuzumab in patients with HER2-altered solid tumors. The study included a cohort of 31 heavily pretreated female patients with HER2-mutated metastatic breast cancer who were also HER2 negative per local testing. Hormone receptor (HR)-positive patients also received fulvestrant. The overall response rate (primary endpoint) was 41.9% (90% confidence interval (CI): 26.9-58.2). Secondary endpoints of duration of response and progression-free survival were 12.6 months (90% CI: 4.7 to not estimable) and 9.5 months (90% CI: 5.4-13.8), respectively. No new safety signals were detected. Responses were observed across various HER2 mutations, including mutations in the tyrosine kinase and extracellular domains. The chemotherapy-free regimen of tucatinib and trastuzumab showed clinically meaningful antitumor activity with durable responses and favorable tolerability in heavily pretreated patients with HER2 mutations. These data support further investigation of HER2-targeted therapies in this patient population.

Diabetes & endocrinology,10.1016/S2213-8587(24)00316-4,"Current BMI-based measures of obesity can both underestimate and overestimate adiposity and provide inadequate information about health at the individual level, which undermines medically-sound approaches to health care and policy. This Commission sought to define clinical obesity as a condition of illness that, akin to the notion of chronic disease in other medical specialties, directly results from the effect of excess adiposity on the function of organs and tissues. The specific aim of the Commission was to establish objective criteria for disease diagnosis, aiding clinical decision making and prioritisation of therapeutic interventions and public health strategies. To this end, a group of 58 experts—representing multiple medical specialties and countries—discussed available evidence and participated in a consensus development process. Among these commissioners were people with lived experience of obesity to ensure consideration of patients’ perspectives. The Commission defines obesity as a condition characterised by excess adiposity, with or without abnormal distribution or function of adipose tissue, and with causes that are multifactorial and still incompletely understood. We define clinical obesity as a chronic, systemic illness characterised by alterations in the function of tissues, organs, the entire individual, or a combination thereof, due to excess adiposity. Clinical obesity can lead to severe end-organ damage, causing life-altering and potentially life-threatening complications (eg, heart attack, stroke, and renal failure). We define preclinical obesity as a state of excess adiposity with preserved function of other tissues and organs and a varying, but generally increased, risk of developing clinical obesity and several other non-communicable diseases (eg, type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, certain types of cancer, and mental disorders). Although the risk of mortality and obesity-associated diseases can rise as a continuum across increasing levels of fat mass, we differentiate between preclinical and clinical obesity (ie, health ",Branca F; Galea G; Luna Fuentes JR; Mooney VM; Nadglowski J,Mexican Society of Obesity; Obesity Action Coalition; Department of Nutrition and Food Safety; European Coalition for people Living with Obesity; Regional Office for Europe,francesco.rubino@kcl.ac.uk.

Utilizing data from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Open Payments database covering 2016-2022, the authors conducted a comprehensive analysis of industry payments to neurosurgeons. This methodology included univariate and multivariate analyses to examine the disparities in payments, with a focus on identifying significant differences in compensation across genders. An analysis of 24,074 industry transactions totaling $388,916,456.88 underscored pronounced gender disparities, with female neurosurgeons involved in merely 2.47% of these transactions and receiving just 0.91% of the overall financial value. The data revealed significant discrepancies in compensation between genders across all contributing companies. Male neurosurgeons engaged in a higher average number of annual transactions compared with their female counterparts (4.60 vs 2.75, p < 0.001), across various financial interactions. This included a greater participation in royalties and licenses (1.49 vs 0.31, p < 0.001), consulting fees (2.16 vs 1.63, p = 0.024), and acquisitions (0.01 vs 0.00, p = 0.006). On average, female neurosurgeons were compensated $16,303.66, starkly lower than the $75,523.20 average received by their male counterparts (p < 0.005). This gap was especially significant in royalties and licenses, where females earned an average of $5168.57 compared with $61,898.47 for males (p = 0.004). Additionally, in acquisitions, female neurosurgeons received no payments at all, whereas males averaged $2153.43 (p = 0.042). Several of these disparities remained significant even after accounting for potential confounding factors, highlighting a systematic bias in compensation and industry engagement against female neurosurgeons. The study underscores a significant gender-based disparity in the financial interactions between neurosurgeons and the medical device industry. These disparities highlight the need for systemic changes to address the underlying factors contributing to inequity in compensation and industry collaboration opportunities. Implementing equitable compensation structures, mentorship programs, and inclusive policies is a crucial step toward achieving gender parity in neurosurgery and ensuring the field benefits from the diverse skills and perspectives of all its members.",,,

Institutions have sought to address student-specific career goals through combined degree programs such as the Medical Scientist Training Program and MD/MBA. However, only a small percentage of medical students pursue these additional degrees. Partnerships between medical schools and Medical Technology (MedTech) accelerators may create unique opportunities for medical students to gain real-world experience with scientific innovation and entrepreneurship. An internship program was developed by the Keck Translational Biotechnology Association and the West Coast Consortium for Technology & Innovation in Pediatrics (CTIP), a Food and Drug Administration-funded pediatric medical device accelerator. Students and companies applied to participate and were paired based on students' interests and experience, and project plans were developed together. An initial orientation provided an overview of the program structure and expectations. Students and mentors met biweekly to address questions or concerns surrounding the progress of their projects. Students gave final project presentations and completed program evaluations. Data from 3 iterations of the program are reported. Student program satisfaction was measured across 5 domains. Students felt that working with CTIP was valuable to their education (mean score = 3.7 of 5.0) and encouraged them to pursue future careers in MedTech (mean score = 4.0 of 5.0). Students provided a few suggestions to improve the program, including more structure, clear expectations around time commitment and deliverables, and stipends for students. Participation in the program grew over time. The initial iterations of the internship program were well received by students. Several opportunities for improvement were noted. The program grew over time. Partnerships with accelerator programs at medical schools and academic medical centers may provide key real-world opportunities for students to learn about MedTech.",,,

However, a concerning trend has emerged over the past decade: a decline in interest from VC funds toward investing in medical devices. Particularly alarming is the more than 50% decrease in investment in early-stage medical device development over the span of 2 decades. In the last 2 years, there has been a significant drop in small to mid-cap VC funds allocated toward the cardiovascular (CV) device space. These obstacles are exacerbated by several factors, including high interest rates, inflation, global economic slowdown, and ongoing international conflicts. These declining investments stifle innovation and jeopardize the timely development of life-saving technologies, highlighting the urgent need for increased funding support.

Dysregulation of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) is linked to COVID-19, but also to non-COVID-19 ARDS. It is still unclear whether changes in the RAS are associated with prognosis of severe COVID-19. In this prospective exploratory study, blood samples of 94 patients with COVID-19 were taken within 48 h of admission to a medical ward or an ICU. In ICU patients, another blood sample was taken seven days later. Angiotensin (Ang) I-IV, Ang 1-7, Ang 1-5 and aldosterone concentrations were measured with liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) followed by calculation of markers for activities of renin (PRA-S) and ACE (ACE-S), alternative RAS activation (ALT-S) as well as the ratio of aldosterone to Ang II (AA2R). Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and ACE2 concentrations were measured by LC-MS/MS-based assays. All RAS parameters were evaluated as predictors of 28-day and 60-day survival using receiver operating characteristic and multivariate logistic regression analysis. AA2R at inclusion was a predictor of 60-day survival for ICU patients with an AUROC of 0.73. Ang II and active ACE2 were inversely associated with survival (OR 0.07; 95%CI 0.01, 0.39 and OR 0.10; 95%CI 0.01, 0.63) while higher Ang 1-7 predicted favorable outcome (OR 6.8; 95%CI 1.5, 39.9). ICU patients showed higher concentrations of all measured angiotensin metabolites, PRA-S, ALT-S and active ACE2, and lower ACE-S and AA2R than patients in the medical ward at inclusion. After seven days in the ICU, Ang I, Ang II, Ang III and Ang IV concentrations decreased, while ACE and ACE2 levels increased. Ang I, PRA-S, Ang 1-7 and Ang 1-5 concentrations correlated with the SOFA score both at the time of inclusion and after seven days, and driving pressure after seven days. AA2R at inclusion predicted 60-day survival with moderate sensitivity, revealing a dissociation between unchanged aldosterone and increased Ang II levels in the most severely ill COVID-19 patients. After adjustment for confounders, Ang 1-7 as the final metabolite of alternative RAS was predictive for survival.",Domenig O; Poglitsch M,Attoquant Diagnostics GmbH,felix.kraft@meduniwien.ac.at.

This study aims to evaluate the differences in accuracy between novel AR-guided pedicle screw insertion and conventional surgery techniques. A randomized controlled trial was conducted from March 2019 to December 2023 to compare the efficacy of AR-guided pedicle screw fixation with conventional freehand surgery using CT guidance. The study included 150 patients, aged 18-75, with 75 patients in each group. The total number of pedicle screws planned for the clinical trial placement was 351 and 348 in the experimental and control groups. The safety and efficacy of the procedures were evaluated by assessing screw placement accuracy and complication rates. In the full analysis set (FAS) analysis, the difference in the excellent and good rates of screw placement (experimental group - control group) and 95% confidence interval was 6.3% [3.0%-9.8%], with a p value of 0.0003 for the superiority test. In the FAS sensitivity analysis, the success rate was 98.0% (344 out of 351) in the experimental group and 91.7% (319 out of 348) in the control group, with a difference and 95% confidence interval of 6.3% [2.9% and 9.8%, respectively].

The authors sought to determine the incidence, predictors, and clinical outcomes of hemodynamic valve deterioration (HVD) according to the Valve Academic Research Consortium 3 definition after TAVR. We analyzed consecutive patients undergoing TAVR in the prospective Bern TAVI (Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation) registry between August 2007 and June 2022 for the incidence and predictors of HVD and performed case control-matching to compare outcomes according to HVD. A total of 2,403 eligible patients (mean age 81.8 ± 6.2 years, median Society of Thoracic Surgeons Predicted Risk of Mortality score 3.8% [Q1-Q3: 2.4%-6.0%]) were included and had a median duration of follow-up of 376 days (Q1-Q3: 365-1,825 days).

Initial studies, at 1950 MHz, have focused on investigating thermophysiological effects of RF exposure, and replication studies related to RF-EMF exposure and progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD) in mice predisposed to AD. The RC exposure system was chosen as it allows relatively unconstrained movement of animals during exposures which can have the beneficial effect of minimizing stress-related, non-RF-induced biological and behavioral changes in the animals. The performance of the RCs was evaluated in terms of the uniformity of the Whole-Body Average-Specific Absorption Rate (WBA-SAR) in mice for a given RF input power level. The expanded uncertainty in WBA-SAR estimates was found to be 3.89 dB. Validation of WBA-SAR estimates based on a selected number of temperature measurements in phantom mice found that the maximum ratio of the temperature-derived WBA-SAR to the computed WBA-SAR was 1.1 dB, suggesting that actual WBA-SAR is likely to be well within the expanded uncertainties.",,,
39812173,Tranexamic acid for preventing postpartum haemorrhage after vaginal birth.,2025-01-15,The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,10.1002/14651858.CD007872.pub4,"Postpartum haemorrhage (PPH) is common and potentially life-threatening. The antifibrinolytic drug tranexamic acid (TXA) is thought to be effective for treating PPH. There is growing interest in whether TXA is effective for preventing PPH after vaginal birth. In randomised controlled trials (RCTs), TXA has been associated with increased risk of seizures and unexplained increased mortality when given more than three hours after traumatic bleeding. Reliable evidence on the effects, cost-effectiveness and safety of prophylactic TXA is required before considering widespread use. This review updates one published in 2015. To assess the effects of TXA for preventing PPH compared to placebo or no treatment (with or without uterotonic co-treatment) in women following vaginal birth. We searched MEDLINE, Embase, CENTRAL, and WHO ICTRP (to 6 September 2024). We also searched reference lists of retrieved studies. We included RCTs evaluating TXA alone or in addition to standard care (uterotonics) for preventing PPH following vaginal birth. For this update, we required trials to be prospectively registered (before participant recruitment), and we applied a trustworthiness checklist. Critical outcomes were blood loss ≥ 500 mL and blood loss ≥ 1000 mL. Important outcomes included maternal death, severe morbidity, blood transfusion, receipt of additional surgical interventions to control PPH, thromboembolic events, receipt of additional uterotonics, hysterectomy, and maternal satisfaction. We used the Cochrane risk of bias tool (RoB 1) to assess the risk of bias in the studies. Two review authors independently selected trials, extracted data, assessed risk of bias, and assessed trial trustworthiness. We used random-effects meta-analysis to combine data. We assessed the certainty of the evidence using GRADE. We included three RCTs with 18,974 participants in total. The trials were conducted in both high- and low-resource settings and involved participants at both low and high risk of PPH. The trials compared intravenous TXA (1 g) and standard care versus placebo (saline) and standard care. After applying our trustworthiness checklist, we did not include any of the 12 trials in the previous version of this review. Prophylactic tranexamic acid in addition to standard care compared to placebo in addition to standard care TXA results in little to no difference in blood loss ≥ 500 mL (risk ratio (RR) 0.93, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.81 to 1.06; 2 studies, 18,897 participants; 5 fewer per 1000, 95% CI 15 fewer to 5 more; high-certainty evidence). TXA likely results in little to no difference in blood loss ≥ 1000 mL (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.07; 2 studies, 18,897 participants; 3 fewer per 1000, 95% CI 6 fewer to 1 more; moderate-certainty evidence). TXA likely results in little to no difference in severe morbidity (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.12; 1 study, 15,066 participants; 2 fewer per 1000, 95% CI 6 fewer to 2 more; moderate-certainty evidence). TXA results in little to no difference in receipt of blood transfusion (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.06; 3 studies, 18,972 participants; 0 fewer per 1000, 95% CI 10 fewer to 12 more; high-certainty evidence). TXA may result in little to no difference in receipt of additional surgical interventions to control PPH (RR 0.63, 95% CI 0.32 to 1.23; 2 studies, 18,972 participants; 1 fewer per 1000, 95% CI 2 fewer to 1 more; low-certainty evidence). In women with anaemia, TXA results in little to no difference in receipt of additional uterotonics (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.10; 1 study, 15,066 participants; 3 more women per 1000, 95% CI 8 fewer to 24 more; high-certainty evidence). In women with no anaemia, TXA results in a slight reduction in receipt of additional uterotonics (RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.61 to 0.92; 1 study, 3891 participants; 24 fewer women per 1000, 95% CI 38 fewer to 8 fewer; high-certainty evidence). TXA likely results in little to no difference in maternal satisfaction. The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of TXA on maternal death, thromboembolic events, and hysterectomy (very low-certainty evidence): maternal death (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.39 to 2.49; 2 studies, 15,081 participants; 0 fewer per 1000, 95% CI 1 fewer to 2 more); thromboembolic events (RR 0.25, 95% CI 0.03 to 2.24; 3 studies, 18,774 participants; 3 fewer women per 10,000, 95% CI 4 fewer to 5 more); hysterectomy (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.36 to 2.19; 1 study, 15,066 participants; 1 fewer women per 10,000, 95% CI 9 fewer to 16 more). Adding prophylactic TXA to standard care of women during vaginal birth makes little to no difference to blood loss ≥ 500 mL and likely makes little to no difference to blood loss ≥ 1000 mL or the risk of severe morbidity, compared to placebo and standard care. TXA may result in little to no difference in additional surgical interventions to control PPH and results in little to no difference in blood transfusions. One trial found that TXA reduced the use of additional uterotonics in women without anaemia, whereas the largest trial found little to no difference in the use of additional uterotonics in women with anaemia. Although there were very few serious adverse events reported, the evidence is insufficient to draw conclusions about the effect of TXA on maternal death, thromboembolic events, hysterectomy, or seizures. TXA likely results in little to no difference in maternal satisfaction. These findings are based mainly on two large trials. In the smaller of these, less than 30% of study participants were at high risk of PPH. In the largest trial, all participants had moderate to severe anaemia. Those making decisions about routine administration of prophylactic TXA for all women having vaginal births should consider that current evidence does not show a benefit of TXA for blood loss outcomes and related morbidity, and the evidence is very uncertain about serious adverse events.

However, interindividual differences affect the half-life and clearance of rFVIII products. The myPKFiT is a web-based medical-device software program for population pharmacokinetic (PK) simulation of FVIII products to guide accurate FVIII doses and dosing intervals. In this Japanese multicenter observational study, the efficacy of regimen adjustment using myPKFiT was examined. Male patients with hemophilia A undergoing personalized treatment with myPKFiT using either octocog alfa or rurioctocog alfa pegol were included. Patients were aged <18 years. Primary endpoint was annualized bleeding rate (ABR). Secondary endpoints were ABR by type of bleeding, rFVIII product consumption, physical activity level, quality of life, and frequency of rFVIII administrations. Results are presented descriptively; however, for exploratory analysis, data before and after regimen adjustment were compared using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. Seven patients aged 3-17 years (median age 13 years) participated in the study. Mean ABR for all bleeds decreased by 0.86 after PK-guided regimen adjustment. Four patients showed zero ABR before and after regimen adjustment using myPKFiT. No significant differences were noted in the consumption of rFVIII products. However, mean rFVIII consumption decreased in two patients after PK-guided regimen adjustment. Three patients increased physical activity and, according to the treatment based on the PK-guided regimen adjustment, this resulted in no increased bleeding. The results from this study in a small number of patients suggest that PK-guided regimen adjustment with myPKFiT may support optimization of the individual prophylactic administration of the FVIII products octocog alfa and rurioctocog alfa pegol.

Sinus rhythm ECGs without QRS conduction or ST-segment abnormalities obtained at the wards or outpatient clinic were included. The QT interval was corrected for age, sex and ventricular rate in a personalized manner. Subsequently, the added value of a 24-h sinusoid of time-of-day was evaluated. An individual 24-h QT interval amplitude was obtained from the model in a subset with patients that had at least 3 ECGs of which one during the night before their last ECG. The association of this individual QT interval with all-cause mortality was assessed using a left-truncated Cox regression model. The baseline QT correction model was fitted using 237,555 ECGs of 100,644 patients. The personalized corrected QT interval had no relationship with ventricular rate ( Using heterogeneous, real-world hospital data of more than 100,000 patients, circadian rhythmicity proved to be an independent determinant of the QT interval. Both increased and diminished QT rhythmicity was shown to be a predictor of all-cause mortality. QT interval should be corrected for the time-of-day and altered circadian rhythmicity should trigger awareness of increased mortality risk (https://qt.ecgx.ai).",,,

This is especially the case among the cohort of adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) patients undergoing posterior spinal fusion (PSF); associations between comorbidities and ICU LOS are not well-delineated. AIS patients who underwent PSF from January 1st, 2016 to December 1st, 2016 at 101 participating centers were identified using the American College of Surgeons (ACS) National Surgical Quality Im-provement Project (NSQIP) Pediatric database. Patients were subsequently grouped by ICU LOS 0-1 day; 2-3 days; and >3 days. Multivariate regression identified predictors of increased ICU LOS. 2,346 AIS patients were included. The >3 days and 2-3 days groups had higher asthma rates compared to 0-1 day. The >3 days group had higher rates of structural airway abnormalities and he-matologic disorders. Cognitive impairment rates were highest for >3-day ICU LOS. Hematologic dis-orders, structural airway abnormalities, asthma and cognitive impairment were associated with prolonged ICU LOS. These results help inform targets for optimization of acute short-term postoperative care as well as assisting in risk stratification to improve outcomes and reduce costs for ICU-level care of AIS patients at ACS NSQIP Pediatric program-participating hospitals.

While this will in part be driven by the association between obesity, osteoarthritis (OA), and total joint arthroplasty (TJA), recent evidence also indicates that GLP-1-RAs may have direct joint-protective, anti-inflammatory effects. To evaluate the association between GLP-1-RA use and the onset and progression of hip and knee OA in an obese population. Cohort study; Level of evidence, 3. A national health network was queried for patients with an index visit between June 1, 2021, and January 1, 2023, and a body mass index (BMI) ≥30. Patients were stratified into groups without (n = 1,092,225) and with(n = 237,043) preexisting hip and/or knee OA. One-to-one propensity score matching was used to balance GLP-1-RA use based on age, sex, race, BMI, and comorbid type 2 diabetes mellitus. Primary outcomes were incidence of hip OA, knee OA, major joint injections, total hip arthroplasty (THA), and total knee arthroplasty (TKA) within 1 year. Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) between cohorts prescribed and not prescribed GLP-1-RAs. In patients with preexisting OA, GLP-1-RA use correlated with reduced odds of conversion to THA (1.1% vs 2.2%; HR, 0.6; 95% CI, 0.5 to 0.8) and TKA (1.4% vs 2.1%; HR, 0.8; 95% CI, 0.6 to 0.9) within 1 year. In patients without preexisting OA, GLP-1-RA use was associated with an increased incidence of hip OA (0.9% vs 0.7%; HR, 1.4; 95% CI, 1.2 to 1.6), knee OA (2.1% vs 1.9%; HR, 1.3; 95% CI, 1.2 to 3.1), major joint injections (2.2% vs 1.8%; HR, 1.4; 95% CI, 1.3 to 1.5), and TKA (0.09% vs 0.04%; HR, 2.6; 95% CI, 1.6 to 4.3). Comparing cohorts without prior OA, patients who were prescribed a GLP-1-RA demonstrated slightly greater decreases in BMI (-1.00; 95% CI, -1.06 to -0.96) at 1-year after the index visit compared with patients not prescribed a GLP-1-RA (-0.90; 95% CI, -0.94 to -0.84). However, in patients with a prior diagnosis of hip or knee OA, there was no difference noted in BMI change. GLP-1-RAs may provide direct disease-modifying behaviors in patients with preexisting OA diagnosis, per a reduced risk of conversion to TJA not attributable to weight loss. Further investigation is also needed to elucidate the association between GLP-1-RA use and the increased incidence of OA diagnosis and conversion to TKA in patients with no preexisting OA diagnosis.",,,

Here, we report the feasibility of using high-dose boost radiation (3-4 Gy) to the central part of the tumor in patients with unresectable RPS. Five patients with unresectable RPS were treated with radiation therapy using a central boost technique with intensity modulated radiation therapy. On average, doses of 25 Gy to 45 Gy were delivered to the outer part of the tumor (planning target volume 1), while the central part of the tumor (planning target volume 2) received a 56 Gy to 75 Gy physical dose, which translates to a 62.67 Gy to 87.5 Gy equivalent dose in 2 Gy fractions (EQD2). To minimize radiation toxicity to the adjacent bowel and other organs, we used sequential, interdigitated, or simultaneous integrated boost (SIB) techniques. In this case series of variable RPS histology, the median survival postradiation therapy was 30 months. Three of the 5 patients had clinically stable local disease on follow-up scans, and none of the patients experienced clinically significant toxicity. In summary, in this small case series of 5 patients, treatment was tolerated well, and excellent local responses were observed regardless of the timing of the central boost. Given the high rates of metastatic disease that developed in responding patients, effective systemic therapy will likely be needed for unresectable RPS treated with aggressive radiation therapy to the central part of the tumor.",,,

Additionally, DECT images consist of multiple scans of the same sample, revealing information similarity within the energy domain. To leverage this information similarity and address safety concerns related to excessive radiation exposure in DECT imaging, sparse view DECT imaging is proposed as a solution. However, this imaging method can impact image quality. Therefore, this paper presents a hybrid spectrum data generative diffusion reconstruction model (HSGDM) to improve imaging quality. To exploit the spectral similarity of DECT, we use interleaved angles for sparse scanning to obtain low- and high-energy CT images with complementary incomplete views. Furthermore, we organize low- and high-energy CT image views into multichannel forms for training and inference and promote information exchange between low-energy features and high-energy features, thus improving the reconstruction quality while reducing the radiation dose. In the HSGDM, we build two types of diffusion model constraint terms trained by the image space and wavelet space. The wavelet space diffusion model exploits mainly the orientation and scale features of artifacts. By integrating the image space diffusion model, we establish a hybrid constraint for the iterative reconstruction framework. Ultimately, we transform the iterative approach into a cohesive sampling process guided by the measurement data, which collaboratively produces high-quality and consistent reconstructions of sparse view DECT. Compared with the comparison methods, this approach is competitive in terms of the precision of the CT values, the preservation of details, and the elimination of artifacts. In the reconstruction of 30 sparse views, with increases of 3.51 dB for the peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), 0.03 for the structural similarity index measure (SSIM), and a reduction of 74.47 for the Fréchet inception distance (FID) score on the test dataset. In the ablation study, we determined the effectiveness of our proposed hybrid prior, consisting of the wavelet prior module and the image prior module, by comparing the visual effects and quantitative results of the methods using an image space model, a wavelet space model, and our hybrid model approach. Both qualitative and quantitative analyses of the results indicate that the proposed method performs well in sparse DECT reconstruction tasks. We have developed a unified optimized mathematical model that integrates the image space and wavelet space prior knowledge into an iterative model. This model is more practical and interpretable than existing approaches are. The experimental results demonstrate the competitive performance of the proposed model.",,,liujin@ahpu.edu.cn.

We evaluated the acceptability of the 90-day dapivirine levonorgestrel ring (DPV-LNG ring) used for 14 days compared to a dapivirine-only ring (DVR-200mg) in MTN-030/IPM 041 (n = 23), and when used for 90 days cyclically or continuously in MTN-044/IPM 053/CCN019 (n = 25). We enrolled healthy, non-pregnant, HIV-negative women aged 18-45 in Pittsburgh, PA and Birmingham, AL (MTN-030 only). Self-reports of vaginal bleeding and adherence (ring removals, expulsions) were collected via daily short message service. Acceptability data were recorded in face-to-face interviews at study exit. We assessed differences in acceptability by product characteristics and adherence; and associations between baseline characteristics/demographics, number of bleeding days, adherence, and overall acceptability. Most (21/23) women in the 14-day MTN-030 study and about half (13/25) in the 90-day MTN-044 study liked their assigned rings. In MTN-030 there were no significant associations between any variables and overall acceptability of either ring. In MTN-044, women who disliked the DPV-LNG ring had a significantly higher incidence of unanticipated vaginal bleeding, and reporting that vaginal bleeding changes were unacceptable than those who liked it. Although we found no overall association between adherence and acceptability, significantly more women who disliked (versus liked) the DPV-LNG ring reported expulsions during toileting. The DPV-LNG ring could meet the needs of women seeking simultaneous protection from HIV and unintended pregnancy. Addressing issues related to vaginal bleeding and expulsions early in product development will likely enhance acceptability of the DPV-LNG ring.

Instrument selection is complex, considering individual preferences and institutional factors such as costs, instrument performance, and factors related to cleaning and sterilization. Notably, environmental sustainability has gained prominence due to the threat of climate change. This review assessed the existing literature to facilitate evidence-informed decision-making, encompassing clinical and economic efficacy, environmental friendliness, and other important criteria. Following PRISMA guidelines, searches were conducted in Pubmed, Embase, Web of Science, and The Cochrane Library for studies comparing the environmental impact, costs, instrument performance, and contamination risk of disposable versus reusable instruments or new versus reprocessed disposables in endoscopic surgery. Life-Cycle Assessments (LCAs) were included to quantify the climate impact. Exclusions included veterinary studies, general endoscopic procedures, and novel instruments. The search yielded 15 809 studies, 53 studies meeting the inclusion criteria: 38 compared disposable versus reusable instruments and 15 examined new versus reprocessed disposables. Reusables and/or reprocessed disposables showed favorable environmental and economic outcomes compared to new disposables. Instrument performance was comparable between the two groups. No studies were identified that investigated the clinical implications of contamination risk of disposables versus reusables. Six studies evaluating the contamination risk of reusables and reprocessed disposables showed residual pollution after cleaning and sterilization, although data on clinical outcome lacked. This review underscores the environmental benefits of reusables and favors both reusable and reprocessed disposables for their economic advantages. The lack of clear evidence favoring one type over the other in instrument performance necessitates further research. Addressing contamination risks requires additional studies on the clinical impact of residual substances. Future research should report outcomes on environmental sustainability, costs, instrument performance, and contamination risk.",,,

Separately, we searched for studies evaluating W-ECLP in adult patients with ALF or ACLF published between January1990 and July 2023. Two researchers independently screened citations for eligibility and, of eligible studies, retrieved data related to study characteristics, patients and interventions, outcomes definition, and intervention effects. The Cochrane Risk of Bias 2 tool and Joanna Briggs Institute checklists were used to assess individual study risk of bias. Meta-analysis of mortality at 28-30 days post-support system initiation and frequency of at least one serious adverse event (SAE) generated pooled risk ratios (RRs), based on random (mortality) or fixed (SAE) effects models. Of 17 trials evaluating NBAL/BAL systems, 11 reported 28-30 days mortality and five reported frequency of at least one SAE. Overall, NBAL/BAL was not statistically associated with mortality at 28-30 days (RR, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.67-1.07; p = 0.169) or frequency of at least one SAE (RR, 1.15; 95% CI, 0.99-1.33; p = 0.059), compared with standard medical treatment.

This can compromise device functionality and lead to life-threatening complications. High doses of anticoagulants, combined with anti-thrombogenic surface coatings, are typically employed to mitigate this risk, but such treatment can lead to hemorrhagic complications. Therefore, bioactive surface coatings that mimic endothelial blood regulation are needed. However, evaluating these coatings under realistic ECMO conditions is both expensive and challenging. This study utilizes microchannel devices to simulate ECMO fluid dynamics and assess the clot-lysis efficacy of a self-activating fibrinolytic coating system. The system uses antifouling polymer brushes combined with tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) to induce fibrinolysis at the surface. Here, tPA catalyzes the conversion of blood plasminogen into plasmin, which dissolves clots. This positive feedback loop enhances clot digestion under ECMO-like conditions. This findings demonstrate that this coating system can significantly improve the hemocompatibility of medical device surfaces.",,,

For producers and clinicians wanting to prepare containment dressings using readily available polyester bags, it is currently difficult to seal these bags without expensive high-temperature plastic welders. This study aimed to identify simple and affordable methods for sealing maggots within polyester net bags. Heat sealing was the most effective and simplest method to seal the polyester net bags, but the high melting point of polyester required industrial grade heat sealers. An inner lining of polyethylene or polypropylene film at the open side of the bag allowed for complete sealing using low-cost hand-actuated impulse heat sealers. This design even facilitated the addition of plastic zipper-locks, allowing secure closure of the bag without electricity or special equipment. Other sealing methods were identified, but most were time-consuming, required practice or not consistently successful. The maggot containment bag designs and closure methods described herein should prove useful to clinicians without access to contained maggots and to maggot producers without the resources to seal polyester containment bags.

The pro-inflammatory cytokine soluble tumor necrosis factor (TNF) seems to play an important role and thus has been proposed as a therapeutic target for modulation of the neuroinflammatory processes in PD. In this regard, dominant-negative TNF (DN-TNF) agents are promising antagonists that selectively inhibit soluble TNF signaling, while preserving the beneficial effects of transmembrane TNF. Previous studies have tested the protective potential of DN-TNF-based therapy in toxin-based PD models. Here we test for the first time the protective potential of a DN-TNF therapeutic against α-synuclein-driven neurodegeneration in the viral vector-based PD female rat model. To do so, we administered the DN-TNF agent XPro1595 subcutaneously for a period of 12 weeks. In contrast to previous studies using different PD models, neuroprotection was not achieved by systemic XPro1595 treatment. α-Synuclein-induced loss of nigrostriatal neurons, accumulation of pathological inclusions and microgliosis was detected in both XPro1595- and saline-treated animals. XPro1595 treatment increased the percentage of the hypertrophic/ameboid Iba1+ cells in SN and reduced the striatal MHCII+ expression in the α-synuclein-overexpressing animals. However, the treatment did not prevent the MHCII upregulation seen in the SN of the model, nor the increase of CD68+ phagocytic cells. Therefore, despite an apparently immunomodulatory effect, this did not suffice to protect against viral vector-derived α-synuclein-induced neurotoxicity.

This study investigated the immediate effects of TEER on LV volumes and functions and their influence on midterm outcomes, using high-resolution 3-dimensional transesophageal echocardiography. In 80 patients who underwent TEER for severe MR (mean age 79 ± 8 years, 49% with primary MR), LV end-diastolic volume and stroke volume significantly decreased (161 ± 61 to 147 ± 54 ml and 69 ± 18 to 50 ± 15 ml, respectively), whereas end-systolic volume increased (92 ± 60 to 97 ± 45 ml, p <0.0001 for all). Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) (48 ± 16% to 38 ± 14%), global longitudinal strain (16.2 ± 6.8% to 12.8 ± 5.4%), and global circumferential strain (25 ± 10.5% to 18.7 ± 8.5%) deteriorated significantly (p <0.0001 for all). Absolute reductions in LVEF and global circumferential strain were associated with baseline values and afterload reduction, indicated by 3-dimensional vena contracta area decrease (r = 0.47 and r = 0.65, p <0.0001), whereas global longitudinal strain reduction was linked to baseline values and inversely proportional to LV end-diastolic volume (r = 0.63, p <0.0001). Relative LVEF reduction emerged as the strongest predictor of mortality, with a hazard ratio of 1.76 (1.12 to 2.76) per 10% decrease. In conclusion, the acute decrease in LV function after TEER correlates with the degree of MR reduction, with greater impacts observed in circumferential function and patients with higher baseline LVEF. Relative LVEF reduction is a critical echocardiographic predictor of mortality.",,,nicolas.brugger@insel.ch.

In a prospective study, g-SoS was assessed in the upper-outer breast quadrant of 100 women, with 92 of them also having m-ACR assessed by two radiologists across the entire breast. For g-SoS, ultrasonic waves were transmitted from varying transducer locations and the image misalignments between these were then related analytically to breast SoS. To test reproducibility, two consecutive g-SoS acquisitions each were taken at two similar breast locations by the same operator. Measurements were found highly repeatable, with a mean absolute difference ± standard deviation of 3.16 ± 3.79 m/s. Multiple measurements were combined yielding a single g-SoS estimate per each patient, which strongly correlated to m-ACR categories (Spearman's = 0.773). The g-SoS values for categories A-D were 1459.6 ± 0.74, 1475.6 ± 15.92, 1515.6 ± 27.10, and 1545.7 ± 20.62, with all groups (except A-B) being significantly different from each other. Dense breasts (m-ACR C&D) were classified with 100% specificity at 78% sensitivity, with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.931. Extremely dense breasts (m-ACR D) were classified with 100% sensitivity at 77.5% specificity (AUC = 0.906). Quantitative g-SoS measurement of the breast was shown feasible and repeatable using conventional US machines, with values correlating strongly with m-ACR assessments. Question Breast density is a strong predictor of risk for breast cancer, which frequently develops in dense tissue regions. Therefore, density assessment calls for refined non-ionizing methods. Findings Quantitative global speed-of-sound (g-SoS) measurement of the breast is shown to be feasible using conventional US machines, repeatable, and able to classify breast density with high accuracy. Clinical relevance Being effective in classifying dense breasts, where mammography has reduced sensitivity, g-SoS can help stratify patients for alternative modalities. Ideal day for mammography or MRI can be determined by monitoring g-SoS. Furthermore, g-SoS can be integrated into personalized risk assessment.",Schweizer D,Computer-Assisted Applications in Medicine,orcun.goksel@it.uu.se.

Cardiovascular interventions,10.1016/j.jcin.2024.10.002,"Evidence regarding the incidence of prosthesis-patient mismatch (PPM) and long-term mortality after transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) in patients with bicuspid aortic valve stenosis (AS) is scarce. This study sought to assess the incidence and prognostic impact of PPM after TAVR for bicuspid AS compared with that for tricuspid AS. In total, 7,393 patients who underwent TAVR were prospectively enrolled in the OCEAN-TAVI (Optimized Catheter Valvular Intervention Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation) registry, an ongoing Japanese, multicenter registry. We analyzed 7,051 patients (median age = 85 years, 68.4% women) and identified 503 (7.1%) with bicuspid AS. We compared the incidence of PPM and long-term mortality in 497 patients with and 497 without bicuspid AS after one-to-one propensity score matching analysis. Among the 7,051 patients, moderate and severe PPM were observed in 756 (10.7%) and 92 (1.3%) patients, respectively. Upon Kaplan-Meier curve analysis of the overall cohort, severe PPM appeared to be associated with long-term mortality (log-rank test, P = 0.065). After propensity score matching analysis, moderate and severe PPM were more frequently observed among patients with tricuspid AS than patients with bicuspid AS (moderate PPM, 11.7% vs 4.4%; severe PPM, 1.4% vs 1.0%; P = 0.0001). Severe PPM appeared to be associated with all-cause mortality.

In this multicenter, open-label, randomized, controlled, parallel-group clinical trial, adults with T1D were allocated to 26 weeks of HCL (MiniMed™ 670G) or standard therapy (insulin pump or multiple daily injections without real-time continuous glucose monitoring). Psychological outcomes (awareness and fear of hypoglycemia; and diabetes-specific positive well-being, diabetes distress, diabetes treatment satisfaction, and diabetes-specific quality of life (QoL)) were measured at enrollment, mid-trial and end-trial. Linear mixed models were conducted, using restricted maximum likelihood estimation, unadjusted and adjusted (for covariates: age, sex, diabetes duration, glycated hemoglobin, recent severe hypoglycemia, pre-trial insulin delivery modality, enrollment and mid-study scores). 120 participants (mean age 44±12 years) were randomized to intervention (n=61) or standard therapy (n=59). At 13 weeks, the HCL group had better diabetes-specific positive well-being than the standard therapy group (unadjusted: Δ=1.0, p=0.025; adjusted: Δ=1.1, p=0.01), which was maintained at 26 weeks (unadjusted: Δ=0.9, p=0.042; adjusted: Δ=1.0, p=0.023). At 26 weeks, the HCL group also had less diabetes distress (adjusted: Δ=-6.4, p=0.039), fear of hypoglycemia (""maintain high"": adjusted: Δ=-0.8, p=0.034; and ""worry"": adjusted: Δ=-1.8, p=0.048), and perceived ""unacceptably high glucose levels"" (unadjusted: Δ=-1.1, p<0.001; adjusted: Δ=-1.1, p<0.001). HCL did not improve diabetes treatment satisfaction, diabetes-specific QoL, hypoglycemia awareness, or perceived frequency of unacceptably low glucose levels. These findings imply that HCL offers important psychological benefits. In particular, improvement in diabetes-specific positive well-being was observed 13 weeks after HCL initiation and maintained at 26 weeks. Reduction in the perceived frequency of hyperglycemia was also apparent by 26 weeks. Adjusted analyses showed significant reductions in diabetes distress and fear of hypoglycemia at 26 weeks, suggesting these benefits were apparent for people with particular characteristics.

New user cohort study. Longitudinal commercial US claims data. New initiators of budesonide-glycopyrrolate-formoterol or fluticasone-umeclidinium-vilanterol between 1 January 2021 and 30 September 2023 who had a diagnosis of COPD and were aged 40 years or older. In this 1:1 propensity score matched study, the main outcome measures were first moderate or severe COPD exacerbation (effectiveness) and first admission to hospital with pneumonia (safety) while on treatment. Potential confounders were measured in the 365 days before cohort entry and included in propensity scores. Hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated using a Cox proportional hazards regression model. The study cohort included 20 388 propensity score matched pairs of new users initiating single inhaler triple therapy. Patients who received budesonide-glycopyrrolate-formoterol had a 9% higher incidence of first moderate or severe COPD exacerbation (hazard ratio 1.09 (95% CI 1.04 to 1.14); number needed to harm 38) compared with patients receiving fluticasone-umeclidinium-vilanterol and an identical incidence of first admission to hospital with pneumonia (1.00 (0.91 to 1.10)). The hazard of first moderate COPD exacerbation was 7% higher (1.07 (1.02 to 1.12); number needed to harm 54) and the hazard of first severe COPD exacerbation 29% higher (1.29 (1.12 to 1.48); number needed to harm 97) among those receiving budesonide-glycopyrrolate-formoterol compared to fluticasone-umeclidinium-vilanterol. Prespecified sensitivity analyses yielded similar findings to the primary analysis. Budesonide-glycopyrrolate-formoterol was not associated with improved clinical outcomes compared with fluticasone-umeclidinium-vilanterol.

However, despite their widespread use and perceived safety, there is a lack of clear guidance on the efficacy and safety of these supplements for female infertility. The aim of this umbrella review was to identify the best available and most recent evidence on the efficacy and safety of nutrient supplements for female infertility to provide evidence-based guidance for clinicians and reproductive couples. Five electronic databases were searched for umbrella reviews, meta-analyses, and systematic reviews of randomised controlled trials on nutrient supplements for female infertility, published from August 2017 to January 2024. The primary outcomes were live birth, and clinical and biochemical pregnancy rates. Secondary outcomes were adverse effects including miscarriage and ectopic or multiple pregnancy. Quality assessment was performed using the A MeaSurement Tool to Assess systematic Reviews Version 2.0 (AMSTAR 2), and the certainty of evidence for outcomes were assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach, where possible. Four meta-analyses were included. Multiple micronutrients and antioxidants increased live birth rates in women utilising MAR and/or trying to conceive spontaneously compared to placebo, standard or no treatment (odds ratio (OR) 2.59 and 1.81 respectively) with very low certainty evidence. L-carnitine, coQ10, melatonin, myo-inositol, NAC and vitamin D increased clinical pregnancy rates in women with PCOS and/or undergoing MAR compared to placebo, standard or no treatment (odds ratio (OR) 11.14, 2.49, 1.66, relative risk (RR) 1.52, OR 2.15, and 1.49 respectively) with very low certainty evidence. Vitamin D did not increase biochemical pregnancy rates in women utilising MAR with very low certainty evidence. NAC, vitamin D, and pooled antioxidants had no effect on miscarriage rates or multiple pregnancy rates in women trying to conceive spontaneously or utilising MAR, with low to very low certainty evidence. Pooled antioxidants had no effect on ectopic pregnancy rates in women trying to conceive spontaneously or utilising MAR, with low certainty evidence. The available evidence is insufficient to recommend nutrient supplementation to improve female infertility in women trying to conceive naturally and those utilising MAR. However, there is currently no indication that these nutrients pose any risk of significant harm. PROSPERO (CRD42022365966) 20 October 2022.",,,

These properties could be useful for the development of a novel therapeutic or preventive strategy against respiratory infections in the upper respiratory tract (URT) such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) without inducing an immune overreaction. This study investigated the cellular responses of polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs) after exposure to CAP in a three-dimensional (3D) model of the URT. In vitro experiments were conducted using PMNs isolated from human blood to assess cell migration, intracellular production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), NETosis, surface marker expression (CD11b, CD62L, and CD66b), and cell death with live cell imaging and flow cytometry. CAP was applied for 5 min using two distinct modalities: pressurized air plasma with a plasma intensive care (PIC) device and nebulized air plasma (NP) with a new humidity resistent surface microdischarge (SMD) plasma source, both developed by Terraplasma Medical GmbH. There were no significant signs of cell damage or overstimulation with either device under the conditions tested. However, the NP device caused milder effects on PMN functionality compared to the PIC device, but also demonstrated reduced antibacterial efficacy and reactive oxygen/nitrogen species (RONS) production, as analyzed with colorimetric/fluorimetric assay kits. These findings highlight a trade-off between the two CAP modalities, each with distinct advantages and limitations. Further studies are necessary to investigate these effects in the clinical setting and evaluate the long-term safety and efficacy of CAP treatment in the URT.",Gebhardt L; Schober R,Terraplasma Medical GmbH,
39795406,Impact of Cell Design Parameters on Mechanical Properties of 3D-Printed Cores for Carbon Epoxy Sandwich Composites.,,Polymers,10.3390/polym17010002,"The introduction of 3D printing technology has broadened manufacturing possibilities, allowing the production of complex cellular geometries, including auxetic and curved plane structures, beyond the standard honeycomb patterns in sandwich composite materials. In this study, the effects of cell design parameters, such as cell geometry (honeycomb and auxetic) and cell size (cell thickness and width), are examined on acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) core materials produced using fusion deposition modeling (FDM). They are produced as a result of the epoxy bonding of carbon epoxy prepreg composite materials to the surfaces of core materials. Increasing the wall thickness from 0.6 mm to 1 mm doubled the elastic modulus of the re-entrant structures (5 GPa to 10 GPa) and improved compressive strength by 50-60% for both geometries. In contrast, increasing cell size from 6 mm to 10 mm significantly reduced compressive strength by 80% (from 2.5-2.8 MPa to 0.5-0.6 MPa) and elastic modulus by 70-78% (from 9-10 GPa to 2-3 GPa). Flexural testing showed that the re-entrant cores, with a maximum load capacity of 148 N, exhibited more uniform deformation, while the honeycomb cores achieved a higher load capacity of 273 N but were prone to localized failures. These findings emphasize the directional anisotropy and specific advantages of auxetic and honeycomb designs, offering valuable insights for lightweight, high-strength structural applications.",,,

This new phase raises the question of how clinical trials should be designed to scientifically and ethically address the unique features of neural prostheses. Neural prostheses are complex cyberbiological devices able to acquire and process data; hence, their assessment is not reducible to only third-party safety and efficacy evaluations as in pharmacological research. In addition, assessment of neural prostheses requires a causal understanding of their mechanisms, and scrutiny of their information security and legal liability standards. Some neural prostheses affect not only human behaviour, but also psychological faculties such as consciousness, cognition, and affective states. In this Viewpoint, we argue that the technological novelty of neural prostheses could generate challenges for technology assessment, clinical validation, and research ethics oversight. To this end, we identify a set of methodological and research ethics challenges specific to this medical technology innovation. We provide insights into relevant ethical guidelines and assess whether oversight mechanisms are well equipped to ensure adequate clinical and ethical use. Finally, we outline patient-centred research ethics requirements for clinical trials involving implantable neural prostheses.",,,stanisa.raspopovic@meduniwien.ac.at.

Retrospective chart review. Single academic, Level-1 Trauma Center. All geriatric patients (65 years and older) who underwent fixation of an intertrochanteric femoral fracture (AO/OTA type 31A1/2/3) by a single surgeon with the Stryker Gamma System from 2020 to 2024 with at least 3-month follow-up. The Gamma3 (G3) system was used until the Gamma4 became available in September 2022. Patients were grouped based on the implant used for fixation: G3 or Gamma4 (G4) and subgrouped based on the centrum-collum-diaphyseal angle of the implant (125 degrees vs. 130 degrees). The main outcome was sliding of the lag screw. Slide distance was calculated from the difference between the screw position immediately postoperatively and at 6 and 12 weeks postoperatively. The secondary outcome variables were revision surgery for any reason, tip-apex distance, and reduction quality. Fifty-one patients (40 women) with a mean age of 83 years (range 65-99) were in the G3 group compared with 46 patients (31 women) with a mean age of 79 years (range 65-96) in the G4 group. The average BMI of the G3 group was 24 kg/m 2 (15-35 kg/m 2 ) compared with 27 kg/m 2 in the G4 group (17-41 kg/m 2 ) ( P = 0.004). There were no significant differences when comparing diabetes, smoking status, or mechanism of injury between groups ( P > 0.05). There was no significant difference when comparing the average tip-apex distance between the G3 (10 mm) and G4 (9.5 mm) ( P = 0.39). There was no significant difference in reduction quality between the G3 (46 good reductions) and the G4 (42 good reductions) groups ( P = 0.85). At 6 weeks, the G4 (5 mm) had a significantly greater lag screw slide compared with the G3 (3 mm) ( P = 0.016). At 12 weeks, the G4 (7 mm) also had a significantly greater lag screw slide when compared with the G3 (4 mm) ( P = 0.004). There was no significant difference in lag screw slide for the 125 degrees implant between the G3 and G4 groups at 6 weeks (3 mm vs. 5 mm, P = 0.44) or 12 weeks (4 mm vs. 6 mm, P = 0.14). Regarding the 130 degrees implant, the G4 had a significantly greater slide compared with the G3 at both at 6 weeks (5 mm vs. 3 mm, P = 0.03; 95% CI, -6.07 to -0.41) and 12 week (8 mm vs. 4 mm, P = 0.03; 95% CI, -5.65 to -0.26). The G4 group had 7 revision procedures performed (3 lag screw exchanges for iliotibial band irritation and 4 revision arthroplasties for lag screw slide, fracture shortening, iliotibial band irritation, abductor malfunction, and leg length discrepancy) compared with 1 revision procedure (lag screw exchange for iliotibial band irritation) in the G3 group ( P = 0.04). The 130 degrees G4 demonstrated increased lag screw slide and all-cause revision surgery when compared with the 130 degrees G3 when used in the treatment of geriatric intertrochanteric femoral fractures. Given the high incidence of increased slide and the significantly higher revision surgery rate, this implant should undergo further investigation. Prognostic Level III.

The standard of care is intramedullary nailing. The Smith & Nephew Trigen Intertan (Memphis, TN, US) is an intramedullary nail with a novel design that incorporates two integrated compression screws. We present a case of intramedullary nail failure in a patient with a subtrochanteric fracture. A 62-year-old woman with osteoporosis, a 40-year history of smoking, and consumption of two to three alcoholic beverages daily, weighing 177 pounds and five feet two inches tall (BMI 32.4), experienced a low-energy fall in her home. She presented to the emergency department (ED) with a shortened and externally rotated right leg with pain on manipulation. Her neurovasculature was intact. An X-ray revealed a comminuted, right subtrochanteric femur fracture. The patient underwent open reduction and internal fixation with a Trigen Intertan nail with no intraoperative complications. Her leg returned to pre-injury length, and she resumed ambulating at her pre-injury level. Six weeks later, the patient experienced pain upon standing. She was transported to the ED by ambulance where she presented with a shortened externally rotated right leg with pain on manipulation. An X-ray revealed failure of the intramedullary nail with breakage at the lag screw hole. Her care was transferred to another orthopedic surgeon (JC), where she underwent hardware removal and conversion to a total hip arthroplasty. Postoperatively, her legs were of equal length, and her neurovasculature remained intact. Four months later, at her final follow-up, she was ambulating unassisted at her pre-fracture level. Subtrochanteric fractures in elderly patients pose serious threats to morbidity, mortality, and quality of life. Surgery with intramedullary nail placement and rapid ambulation have generally favorable outcomes. Failure rates are generally very low. Such circumstances generally require hardware removal and total hip arthroplasty, which are generally curative but can confer small risks of morbidity and mortality.",,,

Requirements to visit an opioid treatment provider (OTP) clinic for methadone treatment limits access to treatment, impacts quality of life, and reduces OUD treatment program retention.

To identify challenges for patients treated with methadone for OUD and gain their perspectives on COPA. Adult patients treated with methadone at a single-site OTP clinic were recruited to complete a qualitative interview regarding their experience with methadone and the impact that expansion of take-home doses would have on their life. Participants were provided printed resources describing COPA and handled a COPA device before being asked for their perspectives. Participants (n=12) were 58.33 percent male and 41.67 percent female, and had no take-home doses (n=5), 2 to 5 days of take-home doses (n=4), or six or more days of take-home doses (n=3). Most (91.67%) participants desired more take-home doses, and 66.7 percent stated more take-home doses would reduce the negative impact of OUD treatment on their ability to work. Average time and cost per trip to obtain their methadone dose at the clinic was 75 minutes and $36.58, respectively. Participants responded positively toward COPA. Participants with no take-home privileges would pay $126.88 per month to obtain take-home privileges by using COPA, and those with take-home privileges would pay $30.31 per month to keep the same level of take-home doses and $117.50 per month to expand their take-home doses using COPA. Participants endured a monetary and time burden to access their methadone treatment, and wished to have more take-home doses to reduce the frequency of their visits to the OTP clinic. Participants viewed take-home doses as having a positive impact on their ability to care for family members, hold a job, and travel, and they appreciated the key attributes of COPA and were willing to invest their own funds to gain access to the device. COPA is a potential solution to expand take-home methadone access to patients while ensuring safety, adherence, retention, and appropriate use.",Morse E; Christianson G; Olivadoti M; Timberlake J,Dr. Olivadoti is with Assisi Medical Affairs Consulting; Mr. Christianson is with 4C Research Group in Somerton; Dr. Morse is with Carolina Performance in Raleigh; Mr. Timberlake is with Berkshire Biomedical Corporation in Dallas,
39790199,Pregnancy & cardiovascular disease: the PREG-CVD-HH registry.,,Cardiovascular diagnosis and therapy,10.21037/cdt-24-248,"Cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains the leading cause of death in pregnant and peripartal women in western countries. Physiological changes during pregnancy can lead to cardiovascular complications in the mother; women with pre-existing heart disease may not tolerate these changes well, increasing their susceptibility to adverse cardiovascular outcomes during pregnancy. The aim of this study is to characterize pregnancy-induced changes in cardiac function, biomarker concentrations and cardiovascular outcomes in women with CVD during pregnancy at a tertiary care hospital in Germany. The PREG-CVD-HH study is a prospective single-center observational study of pregnant women with prevalent CVD treated at the University Medical Center Hamburg, Germany and currently includes 63 women with congenital or acquired heart disease and ten women from the general population included as controls. Participants underwent baseline assessment and dedicated comprehensive echocardiography. Biomarkers N-terminal pro B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), MR-proadrenomedullin (MRproADM) and high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I (hs-cTnI) were measured serially throughout pregnancy and until 6 and 12 months postpartum. A maternal cardiac event was defined as death due to cardiovascular cause, arrhythmia, heart failure or hospitalization for other cardiac intervention. Mean maternal age was 34 years. A majority had a congenital heart disease (N=41), 10 patients developed pregnancy-associated CVD (e.g., preeclampsia, peripartum cardiomyopathy) and 12 women had known acquired heart disease (e.g., valvular disease, arrhythmia, cardiomyopathy). New-onset heart failure was observed in 14.1% of patients (N=9). Five patients developed arrhythmia and three patients developed preeclampsia. About 21.2% of patients were hospitalized due to cardiovascular events. Death from any or cardiovascular cause did not occur over the study period. Left and right ventricular global longitudinal strain (LV GLS, RV GLS) showed a transient worsening in the third trimester and peripartum period. NT-proBNP ranges broadened during the pregnancy and tended to progressively decrease postpartum in women with CVD. Hs-cTnI levels tended to trend upwards during pregnancy in patients with CVD, however, the hs-cTnI levels remained consistently low throughout pregnancy. In our cohort, pregnancy was associated with a transient increase in cardiac biomarkers and worsening of cardiac function during the third trimester and peripartum. These temporal changes reversed at 6-12 months postpartum, potentially due to decreased cardiac load, fluid shifts and hormonal changes.

39788685,A new platform of electrowetting-on-dielectric digital microfluidics for rapid detection of early-stage Hepatocellular Carcinoma(HCC) specific biomarker.,2025-01-09,Analytica chimica acta,10.1016/j.aca.2024.343533,"The early detection of Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC) is crucial for improving patient survival rates.Early diagnosis of HCC can significantly enhance treatment outcomes and reduce disease progression. Antigen detection of tumor markers is one of the important diagnostic methods for HCC. However, Traditional antigen detection methods often rely on heavy detection equipment, involve lengthy turnaround times, and must be conducted in laboratory settings. Therefore, there is a clear need for a portable, low-skill, rapid sample-to-result detection method for early HCC biomarkers. We propose a new platform based on electrowetting-on-dielectric digital microfluidic(EWOD-DMF) for the detection of early-stage HCC biomarkers, enabling the quantitative measurement of Alpha-Fetoprotein (AFP), the proportion of AFP-L3 in total AFP (AFP-L3%), and Des-Gamma-Carboxy Prothrombin (DCP). First, serum samples are processed through the microfluidic system, achieving the separation of AFP-L3 within 10 min. Next, immunoassays are performed within 15 min, using magnetic particles to capture biomarkers such as AFP, AFP-L3, and DCP, followed by enzymatic reactions that generate detectable signals. Each chip can simultaneously detect three biomarkers from five different samples, allowing for a total of fifteen targets to be tested, with only approximately 2.4 μL of serum required for each biomarker detection. Ultimately, data are analyzed with dedicated software to quantitatively measure the HCC biomarkers. The detection limits for AFP or AFP-L3 and for DCP are 0.24 ng/mL and 1.89 ng/mL, respectively. This study presents a EWOD-DMF platform for early-stage HCC diagnosis, capable of simultaneously detecting multiple samples and biomarkers, thus improving detection efficiency and diagnostic accuracy. Moreover, the platform has POCT capability, with advantages in portability and cost-effectiveness, providing clinicians and primary healthcare institutions with a fast and convenient solution for early-stage HCC diagnosis.",Xia W; Wang X; Jin J; Wang X,Department of Molecular Diagnostics; Nanjing RealMind Biotech Co.,chenying@xzhmu.edu.cn.

After initially exploring trade flows among different regions, the paper conducts an in-depth analysis of the network's overall structure and the significance of its nodes. Furthermore, the evolution of the trade network's community structure is discussed and its robustness and dynamics over recent years are assessed through computer program simulation. The findings are as follows: First, semiconductor trade flows are concentrated primarily among a few regions in Asia, US, and EU. Second, the network has grown in size and exhibits significant ""small-world"" characteristics in all segments, deviating from the typical ""sparsity"" seen in large-scale networks. Third, Japan, the US, and a few European regions wield significant influence in semiconductor materials and equipment trade, while Asian economies such as Chinese mainland, Chinese Taiwan, and Korea dominate semiconductor components trade. Fourth, the raw materials trade network has diversified in recent years, while the trade networks for equipment and finished components remain in a state of continuous ""polarization."" Fifth, the semiconductor trade network demonstrates robustness against random attacks but collapses quickly under targeted attacks. Among the three segments, the trade network of finished components, being larger in scale, exhibits greater resilience against both random and targeted attacks. This paper not only enhances the construction of the global semiconductor trade network but also introduces a dynamic perspective, offering deeper insights into its structure and robustness. The insights gained from this analysis provide valuable guidance for policymakers and companies, especially amidst rapid technological change and geopolitical tensions.",,,

These include the scheduled use of acetaminophen, gabapentinoids, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. In addition, intravenous analgesics such as dexmedetomidine, ketamine, magnesium, and lidocaine have been shown to both complement the maintenance of anesthesia as well as optimize pain control postoperatively. Long-acting opioids remain a key component of pain management when provided to reduce the overall use of short-acting synthetic opioids or in direct response to break though pain after exhausting other alternatives. When applied in a bundled fashion, several studies have demonstrated a reduction in overall opioid administration and improved rates of postoperative recovery.

This approach enables treating to a desired tissue temperature and depth to provide a safe, effective, reproducible, and durable treatment of acne. We designed and built a 1726 nm laser system with a 40 W maximum power output, a highly controlled air-cooling device, and a thermal camera in the handpiece, which permits real-time temperature monitoring of the epidermis. IRB-approved safety and efficacy trials demonstrated SG damage at depth, resulting in safe, efficacious, and durable clinical outcomes. Bioheat transfer and light transport modeling confirmed that the pulsing protocols could produce therapeutic temperatures at various SG depths, while protecting the epidermis and dermis with bulk air-cooling. Similarly, we employed clinical observations and photothermal modeling to identify pain mitigation opportunities while maintaining therapeutic efficacy. Biopsies were subsequently taken for histological evaluation. Clinical and histological data, confirmed with modeling, demonstrated that multi-pulse laser delivery with bulk air-cooling selectively increased SG temperature compared to surrounding dermis and at depths unachievable by a single pulse. Subjects showed an average 71% ILC reduction at 3 months posttreatment. We identified two different pulsing protocols with similar selective photothermolysis (SP) of the SG with very different pain responses. Thus, changing the pulsing protocols allowed for pain mitigation and eliminated the need for injectable anesthetic. Histology confirmed the selective damaging of the SG at depth and the preservation of the surrounding dermis and the epidermis. The multi-pulse 1726 nm laser with bulk air-cooling, thermal monitoring, treat-to-temperature (and depth) control, and a unique pulsing protocol, is capable of selectively damaging SGs at depth without damage to the surrounding dermis or the epidermis. The system offers two different protocols that were developed with different levels of discomfort allowing for two different methods for pain mitigation (injectable vs. topical anesthesia).",Sierra R; Estes M; Eck A; Intintoli A; Hofvander H; Cohen JL; Goldman MP; Pomerantz H,Accure Acne Inc.; VivaSkin Dermatology and Aesthetics; AboutSkin Dermatology and Derm Surgery; Cosmetic Laser Dermatology,

It is known that AF impairs health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in the general population, but data on HRQOL in stroke patients with newly diagnosed AF are sparse. Post hoc analysis of the prospective, investigator-initiated, multicenter MonDAFIS study (NCT02204267) to analyze whether AF-related oral anticoagulation (OAC), and/or AF-symptom severity are associated with HRQOL after ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA). HRQOL was measured using the EQ-5D-3L-questionnaire (including EQ-index/EQ-VAS) at baseline and after 12 months using multivariable linear mixed models. AF symptom severity was assessed using the European Heart Rhythm Association classification and symptom severity score (EHRA score) categorizing patients with no/mild/severe/disabling AF-related symptoms. A first episode of AF was detected in 261/2927 (8.9%) patients within 12 months after the index stroke and 227/2920 (7.8%) patients had AF and were anticoagulated at 12 months. HRQOL (measured by EQ-index, n = 2495 patients) was higher in AF patients on OAC compared to AF patients without OAC at 12 months after stroke (mean difference: MD: -16.8, 95% CI: 5.6 to 28.0), and similar in AF patients under OAC compared with patients without AF (MD: 2.0, 95% CI: -2.2 to 6.3). AF-related symptoms were negatively associated with HRQOL (measured by EQ-index) indicating that stroke patients with AF-related symptoms had a lower HRQOL compared to asymptomatic AF patients (mild vs. asymptomatic: MD: -9.0, 95% CI: -17.7 to -0.3; severe/disabling vs. asymptomatic: MD: -19.1, 95% CI: -34.7 to -3.4).

The primary outcome was the rate of mechanical failure of the intramedullary nail defined as deformation and/or breakage of the intramedullary nail. The rate of mechanical failure was compared among retrograde femoral nails used at the same institution during the same time period. One hundred and twenty distal femur fractures were identified (77 native distal femur, 43 periprosthetic) that were treated with a retrograde intramedullary nail. Average patient age was 67 years (SD 15.1, range 18-96 years). Eighty-three (69.2%) patients were women. Four mechanical nail failures (deformation and/or breakage of the intramedullary nail) were observed within 6 months of surgery, 2 in patients with native distal femur fractures and 2 in patients with periprosthetic distal femur fractures. All failures occurred among 49 fractures treated with a newly released retrograde femoral nail, the T2 Alpha Retrograde Femoral Nail (Stryker, Mahwah, NJ). This represents an 8.2% mechanical failure rate of distal femur fractures treated with this new nail compared with no failures observed with any other nail ( P = 0.03).

39773449,Measuring Bound Attention During Complex Liver Surgery Planning: Feasibility Study.,2025-01-29,JMIR formative research,10.2196/62740,"The integration of advanced technologies such as augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) into surgical procedures has garnered significant attention. However, the introduction of these innovations requires thorough evaluation in the context of human-machine interaction. Despite their potential benefits, new technologies can complicate surgical tasks and increase the cognitive load on surgeons, potentially offsetting their intended advantages. It is crucial to evaluate these technologies not only for their functional improvements but also for their impact on the surgeon's workload in clinical settings. A surgical team today must increasingly navigate advanced technologies such as AR and VR, aiming to reduce surgical trauma and enhance patient safety. However, each innovation needs to be evaluated in terms of human-machine interaction. Even if an innovation appears to bring advancements to the field it is applied in, it may complicate the work and increase the surgeon's workload rather than benefiting the surgeon. This study aims to establish a method for objectively determining the additional workload generated using AR or VR glasses in a clinical context for the first time. Electroencephalography (EEG) signals were recorded using a passive auditory oddball paradigm while 9 participants performed surgical planning for liver resection across 3 different conditions: (1) using AR glasses, (2) VR glasses, and (3) the conventional planning software on a computer. The electrophysiological results, that is, the potentials evoked by the auditory stimulus, were compared with the subjectively perceived stress of the participants, as determined by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration-Task Load Index (NASA-TLX) questionnaire. The AR condition had the highest scores for mental demand (median 75, IQR 70-85), effort (median 55, IQR 30-65), and frustration (median 40, IQR 15-75) compared with the VR and PC conditions. The analysis of the EEG revealed a trend toward a lower amplitude of the N1 component as well as for the P3 component at the central electrodes in the AR condition, suggesting a higher workload for participants when using AR glasses. In addition, EEG components in the VR condition did not reveal any noticeable differences compared with the EEG components in the conventional planning condition. For the P1 component, the VR condition elicited significantly earlier latencies at the Fz electrode (mean 75.3 ms, SD 25.8 ms) compared with the PC condition (mean 99.4 ms, SD 28.6 ms). The results suggest a lower stress level when using VR glasses compared with AR glasses, likely due to the 3D visualization of the liver model. Additionally, the alignment between subjectively determined results and objectively determined results confirms the validity of the study design applied in this research.",,,

All materials were used according to manufacturers' instructions. All specimens were subjected to two distinct challenges: first, thermomechanical cycling was performed within 24 hours of restoring the specimens to simulate 1 year of masticatory function. Subsequently, the specimens were stored for 18 days in a laboratory biofilm model to promote biofilm formation and to mimic the effects of tooth demineralization. Two sessions of micro-CT imaging were conducted: the first immediately after the thermomechanical cycling and the second post-exposure to the biofilm model. All data on mineral profile measurements reconstructed in the Perkin-Elmer Quantum GX-II CT were transferred to Image J software for analysis and interpretation.

Traditional in vitro models and commercial aerosol systems fail to accurately simulate the complex human respiratory patterns and mucosal barriers. To address this, we have developed the breathing mucociliary-on-a-chip (BMC) platform, which replicates mucociliary clearance and respiratory dynamics in vitro. This platform allows for precise analysis of drug deposition and penetration, providing critical insights into how liposomes and other nanocarriers interact with lung tissues under various airflow conditions. Our results reveal that liposomes penetrate deeper into the cellular layer under high shear stress, with both static and dynamic airflows distinctly affecting their drug release rates. The BMC platform integrates dynamic inhalation systems with mucociliary clearance functionality, enabling a comprehensive evaluation of drug delivery efficacy.

Clinical research suggests that Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), a precursor to dementia, offers a critical window of opportunity for lifestyle interventions to delay or prevent the progression of AD/ADRD. Previous research indicates that lifestyle changes, including increased physical exercise, reduced caloric intake, and mentally stimulating activities, can reduce the risk of MCI. Early detection of MCI is challenging due to subtle and often unnoticed cognitive decline and is traditionally monitored through infrequent clinical tests. In this research, the Smart Driving System, a novel, unobtrusive, and economical technology to detect early stages of neurodegenerative diseases, is presented. The system comprises a multi-modal biosensing array (MMS) and AI algorithms, including driving performance and driver's biometrics, offering insights into a driver's cognitive function. This publication is the first work reported towards the ultimate goal of developing the Smart Driving Device and App, integrating it into vehicles, and validating its effectiveness in detecting MCI through comprehensive pilot studies.",,,

Herein, we present a novel signal-on electrochemical aptamer sensor, utilizing AuNPs-MXene composite materials, for sensitive AFP quantitation. The AuNPs-MXene composite was synthesized through a simple one-step method and modified on portable microelectrodes. As signal molecules, AFP aptamers were conjugated with methylene blue (MB) and immobilized on the electrode surface. When interacting with AFP, conformational changes in the aptamer-target complex caused MB to approach the electrode, and the electrochemical signal was enhanced through signal-on mechanisms. The developed sensor demonstrated high sensitivity and selectivity for AFP, with a log-linear relationship defined as 1-300 ng/mL, and the LOD was 0.05 ng/mL (S/N = 3). The method was applied to laboratorial and real clinical samples and presented satisfactory selectivity, reproducibility, and long-term stability. The proposed high-performance sensor highlights the potential of electrochemical aptamer sensors in improving the warning capabilities in disease management.",Chen J; Wu S,Hangzhou Shuntai Installation Engineering Co.,

39770159,Study on the Abrasive Blasting Mechanism of Solder Welded 304V Wire in Vascular Intervention.,,Micromachines,10.3390/mi15121405,"The solder burrs on the 304V wire surface can easily scratch the vascular tissue during interventional treatment, resulting in complications such as medial tears, bleeding, dissection, and rupture. Abrasive blasting is often used to remove solder burr and obtain a smooth surface for the interventional device. This study conducted an abrasive blasting experiment to explore the effects of process parameters (air pressure, lift-off height, abrasive volume, and abrasive type) on processing time, surface roughness, and mechanical properties to reveal the material removal mechanism. The results indicated that the resin abrasive can remove the SAC burr and keep the 304V integrity due to the proper hardness and Young's module. Impaction pits are the main material removal mode in abrasive blasting. The processing time decreases with the increase in air pressure. The surface roughness increases with the increase in abrasive volume. The primary and secondary factors affecting the surface roughness of the 304V wire after abrasive blasting are the abrasive type and air pressure, followed by the abrasive volume and lift-off height. Blasting leads to a decrease in yield strength, and Young's modulus and the hardness of the abrasive will affect the tensile strength. This study lays a foundation for understanding abrasive blasting and different cutting mechanisms.",Fu S; Shen B,Jiaxing Jiangxin Medical Technology Co.,

Therefore, this study aimed to analyze the crystallinity of hydroxyapatite (HAp) and the three-dimensional structure of collagen in HPP teeth at the molecular level and to search for new biomarkers of HPP. Raman spectroscopy was used to investigate the molecular structure, composition, and mechanical properties of primary teeth from healthy individuals and patients with HPP. The results showed that the crystallinity of HAp decreased and the carbonate apatite content increased in the region near the dentin-enamel junction (DEJ) of HPP primary teeth. X-ray diffraction (XRD) analyses confirmed a decrease in HAp crystallinity near the DEJ, and micro-computed tomography (CT) scanning revealed a decrease in mineral density in this region. These results suggest incomplete calcification in HPP primary dentin and may contribute to the development of diagnostic and therapeutic agents.",,,

Currently, by applying a coating to a bare metal stent (BMS) surface to improve biocompatibility, the main risks after PCI, such as restenosis and thrombosis, are reduced while maintaining the basic requirements for the mechanical behavior of the stent itself. In this work, for the first time, the development and optimization process of the spatial structure of the Co-Cr stent (L-605) with a graphene-based coating using cold-wall chemical vapor deposition (CW-CVD) to ensure uniform coverage of the implant was attempted. The CW-CVD process allows the coating of 3D structures, minimizing thermal stress on the surrounding equipment and allowing the deposition of coatings on temperature-sensitive materials. It produces uniform and high-purity films with control over the thickness and composition. The reduced heating of the chamber walls minimizes unwanted reactions, leading to fewer impurities in the final coating. The graphene layers obtained using Raman spectroscopy at different parameters of the CW-CVD process were verified, their properties were investigated, and the functional mechanical behavior of the studied graphene-covered stent was confirmed. In vitro, graphene-coated stents promoted rapid endothelial cell repopulation, an advantage over gold-standard drug-eluting stents delaying re-endothelialization. Also, full-range biocompatibility studies on potential allergic, irritation, toxicological, and pyrogenic reactions of new material in vivo on small animal models demonstrated excellent biocompatibility of the graphene-coated stents.",,,

Managing PD requires accurate assessment of motor and non-motor symptoms, often complicated by the subjectivity in symptom reporting and the limited availability of neurologists. To address these challenges, commercial wearable devices have emerged to continuously monitor PD symptoms outside the clinical setting. The main devices include PKG™, Kinesia 360™, Kinesia U™, PDMonitor™, and STAT-ON™. These devices utilize advanced technologies such as accelerometers, gyroscopes, and specific algorithms to provide objective data on motor symptoms like tremors, dyskinesia, and bradykinesia. Despite their potential, the adoption of these devices is limited due to concerns about their accuracy, complexity of use, and lack of independent validation.

Various electrode montages are used during TSS, with little understanding of how electrode position influences spinal circuit activation. We sought to identify the thoracolumbar electrode montage associated with the most robust activation of spinal circuits by comparing posterior root-muscle reflexes (PRM reflexes) elicited by 6 montages. Additionally, we assessed tolerability of the stimulation during PRM reflex testing. Fifteen adults with intact neurological systems participated in this randomized crossover study. PRM reflexes were evoked transcutaneously using electrode montages with dorsal-ventral (DV) or dorsal-midline (DM) current flow. DV montages included: [1] cathode over T11/T12, anodes over iliac crests (DV-I), [2] cathode over T11/T12, anodes over umbilicus (DV-U), [3] dual paraspinal cathodes at T11/12, anodes over iliac crests (DV-PI), and [4] dual paraspinal cathodes at T11/12, anodes over umbilicus (DV-PU). DM montages included: [5] cathode over T11/12, anode 5 cm caudal (DM-C), and [6] cathode over T11/12, anode 5 cm rostral (DM-R). PRM reflex recruitment curves were obtained in the soleus muscle of both lower extremities. Lower reflex thresholds (mA) for dominant (D) and nondominant (ND) soleus muscles were elicited in DV-U (D: 46.7[33.9, 59.4], ND: 45.4[32.5, 58.2]) and DV-I (D: 48.1[35.3, 60.8], ND: 45.4[32.5, 58.2]) montages compared to DV-PU (D: 64.3[51.4, 77.1], ND:61.7[48.8, 74.6]), DV-PI (D:64.9[52.1, 77.7], ND:61.4[48.5, 75.5]), DM-C(D:60.0[46.9, 73.1], ND:63.6[50.8, 76.5]), and DM-R(D:63.1[50.3, 76.0], ND:62.6[49.8, 75.5]). DV-U and DV-I montages demonstrated larger recruitment curve area than other montages. There were no differences in response amplitude at 120% of RT(1.2xRT) or tolerability among montages. Differences in spinal circuit recruitment are reflected in the response amplitude of the PRM reflexes. DV-I and DV-U montages were associated with lower reflex thresholds, indicating that motor responses can be evoked with lower stimulation intensity. DV-I and DV-U montages therefore have the potential for lower and more tolerable interventional stimulation intensities. Our findings optimize electrode placement for interventional TSS and PRM reflex assessments. NCT04243044.",,,kelly.thatcher@shepherd.org.
39760845,Memory enhancement by transcranial radiofrequency wave treatment occurs without appreciably increasing brain temperature.,2025-04-14,Physical and engineering sciences in medicine,10.1007/s13246-024-01508-8,"We have previously shown in small studies that full brain Transcranial Radiofrequency Wave Treatment (TRFT) to subjects with Alzheimer's Disease could stop and reverse their cognitive decline. An 8-emitter head device, the ""MemorEM"", was used in these studies to provide TRFT at 915 MHz frequency and power level of 1.6 W/kg Specific Absorption Rate (SAR) during daily 1-hour treatments. Although no deleterious side effects during up to 2.5 years of treatment were reported, it is important to rule out the possibility that brain heating will occur during TRFT in humans at a higher power level of 4.0 W/kg SAR, which is anticipated for future clinical testing in order to increase treatment intensity/efficacy to deep sub-cortical areas. To examine if brain heating occurs during a single 1-hour treatment at 4 W/kg SAR, a hollow human head phantom filled with brain-analogous gel and with an attached MemorEM head device was utilized. Brain temperatures were taken at 64 specific coordinates within the brain gel before and immediately following one-hour of TRFT. Results revealed none of the 64 sites having a temperature increase after TRFT of 1 °C or more. Indeed, 45 of the 64 sites exhibited a temperature rise of less than 0.5 °C, with just three sites exhibiting an increase between 0.75 and 0.9 °C. These results demonstrate that TRFT in a human head phantom that mimics the electromagnetic properties of the human head, does not appreciably increase brain temperature (i.e., is non-thermal) at 915 MHz frequency and 4 W/kg SAR power level. Thus, TRFT would appear to be safe at 4 W/kg for long-term daily treatments.",Baranowski R; Amschler J; Wittwer D; Arendash GW,Ocotillo Electromagnetics; Left Coast Engineering; RF Longevity,arendash@RFlongevity.com.

This retrospective, non-interventional study used the OPAL dataset, derived from electronic medical records. Patients initiated UPA (N = 2624), other JAKis (baricitinib and tofacitinib [N = 925]), or TNFis (adalimumab, etanercept, certolizumab, golimumab, infliximab [N = 3540]) between May 2020 and March 2023. Median persistence (Kaplan-Meier) and effectiveness (Disease Activity Score 28-joint C-reactive protein, three variables [DAS28CRP{3}]) were evaluated for UPA-treated patients and in three propensity score-matched cohorts: UPA monotherapy versus combination therapy, UPA versus other JAKis, and UPA versus TNFis. In patients prescribed UPA, 41.3% were ≥ 65 years old, 33.8% were prescribed as first-line advanced therapy, and 27.2% were prescribed monotherapy. Persistence on UPA was 26.6 months (95% confidence intervals: 24.4, 29.9) and longest in earlier lines of therapy. The DAS28CRP(3) remission rate was 73% at 3 months, with improvements observed across lines of therapy. UPA monotherapy and combination therapy had similar persistence (27.8 [23.5, 33.4] versus 30.4 months [22.1, 35.3], p = 0.84) and effectiveness. UPA showed longer persistence than other JAKis (28.8 [25.6, 32.4] versus 17.2 months [14.9, 19.8], p < 0.001) and TNFis (26.6 [24.9, 30.8] versus 13.3 months [11.5, 14.5], p < 0.001). DAS28CRP(3) remission rates were greater at 3 months for UPA than other JAKis (75.0% versus 61.5%) and TNFis (72.7% versus 59.5%). In unmatched subgroups, compared to cycling between TNFis, switching to UPA from other JAKis or TNFis resulted in longer persistence (JAKi-to-UPA: 25.3 [16.1, not reached]; TNFi-to-UPA: 27.8 [23.2, 35.4]; TNFi-to-TNFi: 9.6 [8.4, 10.7]) and greater DAS28CRP(3) remission rates over 9 months. Overall, the breadth and depth of data from this large real-world dataset continue to support a favorable clinical profile of UPA for the treatment of RA and may inform treatment choices in everyday clinical practice. This study of patients treated in clinical practice looked at how a targeted medication, a Janus kinase inhibitor (JAKi) called upadacitinib, was used to treat rheumatoid arthritis, a disease that causes joint pain and damage. The researchers wanted to see how long patients continued treatment with upadacitinib, how effective it was at reducing symptoms, and how these outcomes compared to other JAKis (baricitinib and tofacitinib) and tumor necrosis factor inhibitors, a different type of advanced medication. Patients continued upadacitinib treatment for a median time of over 2 years. Those patients who had never previously used JAKis or tumor necrosis factor inhibitors continued upadacitinib treatment longer than those patients with previous experience. Patients treated with upadacitinib alone or in combination with less advanced medications like methotrexate continued treatment for a similar length of time. Compared to other JAKis and tumor necrosis factor inhibitors, patients prescribed upadacitinib stayed on their treatment the longest. Upadacitinib helped to lessen the symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis, whether patients took it alone or in combination with medications like methotrexate. After 3 months, more patients treated with upadacitinib experienced reduced symptoms than patients treated with other JAKis or tumor necrosis factor inhibitors. Additionally, patients who switched to upadacitinib after using other JAKis or tumor necrosis factor inhibitors reduced their symptoms and continued treatment for longer than those switching between tumor necrosis factor inhibitors. Overall, patients treated with upadacitinib continued treatment for longer and saw greater improvements in the symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis than patients prescribed other advanced medications.",Ciciriello S; Tahir T; Leadbetter J; Butcher B; Calao M; Walsh N; O'Sullivan C; Smith T; Littlejohn G,WriteSource Medical Pty Ltd; OPAL Rheumatology Ltd; AbbVie Pty Ltd.; Coburg Rheumatology Service,geoff.littlejohn@monash.edu.

Development of purification methods that are scalable and robust is a major focus of EV research. Yet there is still little in the literature that evaluates purification methods against potency of the EV product. In the present study, we examined two monolith chromatography methods with a focus on assessing the ability of purified EVs to retain stimulatory effects on fibroblasts to connect scalable purification methods with product outputs. We characterized EVs recovered from CTX0E03 (CTX) neural stem cell-conditioned medium in terms of biomarker distribution, functional capacity and purity. We evaluated the ability of EVs to promote wound closure in an in vitro scratch assay prior to and following two monolith chromatography steps (anion exchange and hydrophobic interaction) to determine whether these options may better serve EV bioprocessing. EVs from CTX cells were successful in initiating wound repair in a fibroblast scratch assay over 72 h with a single 20-μg dose. EV preparations presented the markers CD9, CD81 and CD63 but also contained culture albumin and DNA as process impurities. EVs recovered by tangential flow filtration could be successfully purified further by both monolith chromatography steps. Post-monolith EV stimulation was conserved. The results indicate that monolith chromatography is a viable purification method for EVs derived from cell culture that does not detract from the product's ability to stimulate fibroblasts, suggesting that product functionality is conserved. Further work is needed in developing suitable downstream processes and analytics to achieve clinically relevant purities for injectable biologics.",Corteling RL,ReNeuron Ltd.,d.bracewell@ucl.ac.uk.
39754992,Preventing disease progression in schizophrenia: What are we waiting for.,2025-04-29,Journal of psychiatric research,10.1016/j.jpsychires.2024.12.042,"Despite research advances and progress in health care, schizophrenia remains a debilitating and costly disease. Onset occurs typically during youth and can lead to a relapsing and ultimately chronic course with persistent symptoms and functional impairment if not promptly and properly treated. Consequently, over time, schizophrenia causes substantial distress and disability for patients, their families and accrues to a collective burden to society. Recent research has revealed much about the pathophysiology that underlies the progressive nature of schizophrenia. Additionally, treatment strategies for disease management have been developed that have the potential to not just control psychotic symptoms but limit the cumulative morbidity of the illness. Given the evidence for their effectiveness and feasibility for their application, it is perplexing that this model of care has not yet become the standard of care and widely implemented to reduce the burden of illness on patients and society. This begs the question of whether the failure of implementation of a potentially disease-modifying strategy is due to the lack of evidence of efficacy (or belief in it) and readiness for implementation, or whether it's the lack of motivation and political will to support their utilization. To address this question, we reviewed and summarized the literature describing the natural history, pathophysiology and therapeutic strategies that can alleviate symptoms, prevent relapse, and potentially modify the course of schizophrenia. We conclude that, while we await further advances in mental health care from research, we must fully appreciate and take advantage of the effectiveness of existing treatments and overcome the attitudinal, policy, and infrastructural barriers to providing optimal mental health care capable of providing a disease-modifying treatment to patients with schizophrenia.",,,jl2616@cumc.columbia.edu.

The miniaturization of ultrasound devices has greatly contributed to their widespread adoption in operating rooms and intensive care units. The integration of AI-enabled tools has further transformed the field by simplifying echocardiographic evaluations and enhancing the reproducibility of hemodynamic measurements, even for less experienced operators. Speckle tracking echocardiography offers a direct, visual, and quantitative assessment of myocardial shortening, serving as a compelling alternative to traditional methods for evaluating right and left ventricular systolic function. In critically ill patients, sublingual microcirculation imaging has revealed a high prevalence of microvascular alterations, which are markers of disease severity. The use of handheld vital microscopes enables the quantification of several key parameters, including vessel density, perfusion, red blood cell velocity, and the perfused vascular density. Such metrics are useful for evaluating microcirculatory health. The development of automated software marks a significant advance toward real-time bedside microvascular assessment. These advancements could eventually allow shock resuscitation to be tailored based on microvascular responses. In parallel with imaging advances, cardiac output monitors have evolved significantly. Once cumbersome devices displaying basic numerical data in tabular form, they now feature sleek, touch-screen interfaces integrated with visual decision-support tools.

Herein, we sought to expand on the capability of MN patches to deliver therapies into skin by providing improved spatiotemporal control. Polylactic-co-glycolic acid (PLGA) microspheres were used to encapsulate model dye and then loaded into MN patches through a layer-by-layer fabrication method that created multiple layers of different composition within each MN. MN patches were loaded with up to 5 μg/MN of PLGA microspheres. Mechanical testing demonstrated that mechanical strength of MNs decreased with increasing number of microsphere layers. Microsphere-loaded MN patches inserted into porcine skin ex vivo and murine skin in vivo fully dissolved within 15 min, administering drug-loaded microspheres for controlled release lasting over 45 days.

Imaging cancer,10.1148/rycan.230154,"Percutaneous tumor ablation has become a widely accepted and used treatment option for both soft and hard tissue malignancies. The current standard-of-care techniques for performing these minimally invasive procedures require providers to navigate a needle to their intended target using two-dimensional (2D) US or CT to obtain complete local response. These traditional image-guidance systems require operators to mentally transpose what is visualized on a 2D screen into the inherent three-dimensional (3D) context of human anatomy. Advanced navigation systems designed specifically for percutaneous needle-based procedures often fuse multiple imaging modalities to provide greater awareness and planned needle trajectories for the avoidance of critical structures. However, even many of these advanced systems still require mental transposition of anatomy from a 2D screen to human anatomy. Augmented reality (AR)-based systems have the potential to provide a 3D view of the patient's anatomy, eliminating the need for mental transposition by the operator. The purpose of this article is to review commercially available advanced percutaneous surgical navigation platforms and discuss the current state of AR-based navigation systems, including their potential benefits, challenges for adoption, and future developments.

LFA is a straightforward and effective paper-based platform for the rapid detection of target analytes in mixtures. Its simple design, low cost, and ease of operation are among the most attractive advantages of LFA. The signal reporting label, which constitutes the core component of LFA detection, is of paramount importance for enhancing the sensitivity of the detection process. The sensitivity of traditional LFA signal labels is insufficient for the detection of biomarkers at low concentrations. To address this issue, AIE materials have been developed in recent years. These materials can significantly enhance the luminescence intensity at high concentrations or in aggregated states, exhibiting excellent photostability and a high signal-to-noise ratio. They possess the advantages of high quantum yields, good photostability, and strong fluorescence, rendering them suitable for a variety of applications, including medical diagnostics, food safety, and environmental monitoring. This review therefore provides an overview of the operational principles of AIE and LFA, details the selection of AIE materials, the design of the platform and their applications, and reviews the latest research. Notable examples include the detection of viral pathogens, bacterial and mycotoxin contamination, antibiotic residues, and pesticide residues. The integration of AIE materials in LFA technology has demonstrated the potential for rapid, accurate, and cost-effective diagnostics. However, challenges remain in large-scale synthesis and multiplexed assays. The paper concludes with a discussion of current limitations and future directions for the technology.",Li X,Juxintang (Chengdu) Biotechnology Co.,elisalijunwang@163.com.

This study introduces composite hyaluronic acid gas-entrapping materials (GEMs) delivering carbon monoxide (CO) to promote wound healing in pigs. These composite materials facilitate burst release followed by sustained release of CO over 48 h. In a porcine full-thickness wound model, CO-GEMs significantly accelerated wound closure compared to the standard-of-care dressing (Tegaderm). Wound area closure with CO-GEMs was 68.6% vs 56.8% on day 14, 41.0% vs 25.1% on day 28, and 26.9% vs 11.8% on day 42, effectively reducing healing time by 14 days. Histological analysis revealed increased epithelialization and neovascularization with reduced inflammation. These findings demonstrate the potential of CO-GEMs as a topical therapeutic to enhance tissue repair in clinically relevant models, supporting further testing for wound-healing applications.",,,

Various devices and configurations of mechanical circulatory support (MCS) exist to support patients, each with unique pathophysiological characteristics. The Intra-aortic balloon pump can improve coronary perfusion, decrease afterload, and indirectly augment cardiac output. TandemHeart, a percutaneous ventricular assist device, can decrease left ventricular preload and directly augment cardiac output. Neither the intra-aortic balloon pump nor the percutaneous ventricular assist device has been shown to decrease mortality in the revascularization era. Venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation can offer complete cardiopulmonary support; however, it has not been shown to decrease mortality. Recent studies have indicated that microaxial flow pumps, such as Abiomed's Impella family of devices, can decrease mortality in the AMI-CS population. Managing AMI-CS requires careful clinical assessment, as no single MCS device is universally effective, and device-related complications are common. While venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation provides complete support, it has not demonstrated a mortality benefit in major trials and carries significant risks. In contrast, microaxial flow pumps have shown a mortality benefit but with higher complication rates.

TaBw01 tantalum rods were fabricated using type FTaY-1 tantalum powder via the foam impregnation-sintering method. Mechanical testing with the Instron 8801 universal testing machine and finite element analysis (FEA) assessed single tantalum rod implantation and impaction bone grafting combined with rod implantation. A total of 86 osteonecrosis of the femoral head (ONFH) patients (94 hips) were treated: the experimental group (45 patients, 50 hips) underwent surgical hip dislocation (SHD) with impaction bone grafting and tantalum rod implantation, while the control group (41 patients, 44 hips) received single rod implantation. Primary failure criteria included femoral head collapse (≥ 2 mm) or total hip arthroplasty. Patient-reported outcomes (PROs), including Harris Hip Score (HHS), Visual Analog Score (VAS), Hip Outcome Score Activities of Daily Living Subscale (HOS-ADL), and Hip Outcome Score Sport-Specific Subscale (HOS-SSS), were analyzed based on Minimum Clinically Important Difference (MCID). FEA confirmed stresses below the material's yield and compressive strength. At 3 years, survival rates for ARCO (Association Research Circulation Osseous) stage IIb and IIc were higher in the experimental group (100%, 80.38%) than the control group, while stage IIa survival was 100% in the control group. The experimental group also had higher MCID attainment for HHS, HOS-ADL, and HOS-SSS. Compared with single TaBw01 implantation, impaction bone grafting combined with TaBw01 implantation via SHD demonstrated superior outcomes for ARCO stage IIb and IIc, with a minimum 2-year follow-up. while single TaBw01 implantation may be more suitable for stage IIa.

The concept was originally demonstrated in closed-channel capillary circuits. We show here that trigger valves can be successfully implemented in open channels. We also show that a series of open-channel trigger valves can be placed alongside or opposite a main channel resulting in a layered capillary flow. We developed a closed form model for the dynamics of the flow at trigger valves based on the concept of average friction length and successfully validated the model against experiments. For the main channel, we discuss layered flow behavior in the light of the Taylor-Aris dispersion theory and in the channel turns by considering Dean theory of mixing.

This study tested the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of this novel therapeutic option. REMOTE-HF was a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, phase Ib dose-titration study with two active arms. Study participants had an established diagnosis of HF with NYHA Class I-III and LVEF ≤ 45%. Patients were required to have an implanted cardiac defibrillator (ICD) or cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) device because of the potential for bradycardia or AV conduction delay, which may be induced by BAY 2413555. The study period included a screening and run-in period, followed by a treatment period of over 28 days, consisting of two parts, A and B, comprising 14 days each. Participants were randomized into 1 of 3 arms: a placebo arm and two BAY 2413555 arms-one receiving 1.25 mg in both Part A and Part B (BAY 1.25 mg-1.25 mg) and the other receiving 1.25 mg in Part A followed by 5 mg in Part B (BAY 1.25 mg-5 mg). The primary safety endpoint was the number of participants with treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs). Secondary endpoints included number of participants with high degree AV block or symptomatic pauses/ bradycardia and changes from baseline in resting heart rate after 2 and 4 weeks of dosing with BAY 2413555. Changes from baseline in heart rate recovery (HRR) at 1 and 2 min after exercise testing and chronotropic reserve (CR) were also assessed. Of the anticipated 129 participants, 22 participants were randomized: 7 to placebo, 8 to BAY 1.25 mg-1.25 mg, and 7 to BAY 1.25 mg-5 mg. The study was terminated early based on new and unexpected preclinical findings from a chronic animal toxicology study in monkeys in which evidence of increased vascular inflammation was observed, leading to a no longer favorable risk-benefit balance for the intended long-term (i.e., life-long) treatment of heart failure patients. Comparable adverse events were not encountered in REMOTE-HF. Overall, until the termination of the study, BAY 2413555 was safe and well tolerated, with no deaths or TEAEs leading to discontinuation, and no symptomatic bradycardia or AV blocks observed. There was a larger change in the mean HRR at 60 s in the pooled BAY 2413555 treatment arms in Part A (1.25 mg) compared to the placebo (+ 7.3 vs. -6.7 bpm), indicating enhanced cardiac parasympathetic activity. Administration of 1.25 mg and 5 mg BAY 2413555 was safe and well tolerated in both active treatment arms, with no concerning safety findings observed. However, due to the limited number of subjects resulting from early termination, the results should be considered with caution and viewed as exploratory.

However, for DBS to be clinically effective, it may require DBS technology that can alter or trigger stimulation in response to changes in biomarkers sensed from the patient's brain. A growing body of evidence suggests that such adaptive DBS is feasible, it might achieve clinical effects that are not possible with standard continuous DBS and that some of the best biomarkers are signals from the cerebral cortex. Yet capturing those markers requires the placement of cortex-optimized electrodes in addition to standard electrodes for DBS. In this Perspective we argue that the need for cortical biomarkers in adaptive DBS and the unfortunate convergence of regulatory and financial factors underpinning the unavailability of cortical electrodes for chronic uses threatens to slow down or stall research on adaptive DBS and propose public-private partnerships as a potential solution to such a critical technological gap.",Kullmann A; Neumann WJ,NeuroOne Medical Technologies Corporation; Movement Disorder and Neuromodulation Unit,awidge@umn.edu.

An investigational, contact-based, 800-kHz, 140° (visual angle) UWF-OCT field-of-view handheld device was used during regular ROP examinations. Images from each examination were captured using the UWF-OCT device, and the zone, stage, and presence of plus disease were diagnosed. If the UWF-OCT system was unable to capture diagnosis, this was recorded. A total of 507 examinations were performed on 83 neonates (mean [SD] birth weight, 905.1 [362.5] g; mean [SD] gestational age, 189.5 [19.1] days) with this system. The vascular border and disease was able to be visualized in 100% of cases, including to and beyond zone III. In some cases, images were able to clearly demonstrate the ora serrata and even the ciliary body. The UWF-OCT device was able to be safely used to perform ROP screenings and subsequent evaluations and provided volumetric imaging of the ora serrata and sometimes the ciliary body. The findings suggest that such devices may be associated with reduced technical challenges of capturing the entire peripheral retina in telemedicine programs, may reduce pain and stress for delicate neonates owing to the reduced use of scleral depression, and, with adaptation of the system, could potentially allow for peripheral imaging of the whole retina in older children and adults.",,,

We aimed to determine the following: (1) the reliability of eyeballing cup inclination/anteversion on AP pelvis radiographs vs geometrical measurements and (2) whether visual assessments are affected by surgeon experience. Fifteen de-identified standing AP pelvis radiographs obtained before rTHA for instability were evaluated by one orthopedic surgeon who measured inclination/anteversion of the cups (n=15) using a new simplified method based on basic geometry. Subsequently, 4 orthopedic surgeons and 4 fellows (postgraduate year 6) assessed inclination/anteversion by eyeballing. A modified Lewinnek safe zone range was employed to categorize each value (in degrees) by geometrical measurements or by raters' eyeballing as within or outside the safe zones. Cohen's kappa ( According to geometrical measurements, 8 and 12 cups were in malposition (for inclination and anteversion, respectively).

However, postoperative ischemic injury of the skin flap is a major complication and a top concern after the surgery. Currently, evidence-based drugs to fully prevent ischemic injury are not available. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of KUS121, a VCP modulator, on flap ischemia using a rodent model. 26 Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into two groups. The experimental group was intraperitoneally administered with 100 mg/kg KUS121 dissolved in 5% glucose solution 1 hour before surgery and once per day after surgery. The control group received the same amount of glucose solution on the same schedule. On day 7, 33.6 ± 3.7% of skin flaps in the control group had developed black necrosis compared with 26.4 ± 3.6% in the KUS121 group (p < 0.01). Immunohistochemistry showed that the KUS121 treatment reduced the number of apoptotic cells in the distal third of the flap (p < 0.01); moreover, in the KUS121-treated rats, the number of cells expressing CHOP, an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress marker, in the middle third of the flap was significantly lower than in the controls (p < 0.01). We examined the mRNA expression of Ddit3 (CHOP) and Casp3 (caspase-3) on day one after the surgery; mRNA expression of both genes appeared to decrease in the KUS121 group, as compared with the control group, although differences between groups were not significant. Thus, in a random pattern flap, KUS121 reduces ER stress and the number of apoptotic cells, thereby reducing ischemic damage of the flap.",,,

This has catalyzed collaboration between cardiologists, hepatologists, endocrinologists, and the wider multidisciplinary team to address the need for earlier identification of those with MASLD who are at increased risk for CVD. The overlap in the pathophysiologic processes and parallel prevalence of CVD, metabolic syndrome, and MASLD highlight the multisystem consequences of poor cardiovascular-liver-metabolic health. Metabolic dysfunction and associated insulin resistance, together with the predilection for ectopic fat deposition in the liver and surrounding tissues, are associated with elevated risk of endothelial dysfunction, systemic inflammatory response, and ectopic fat deposition in the epicardium. This complex pathophysiology can accelerate atherogenic dyslipidemia, atherogenesis, diastolic dysfunction, valvular calcification, and cardiac arrhythmias. Despite the mounting evidence of mechanistic pathways underpinning MASLD and CVD, current recommendations have not clearly focused upon MASLD as a risk factor or target for intervention in CVD. We have brought together a diverse range of international experts committed to promoting cardiovascular-liver-metabolic health and related outcomes across the globe. The overarching goal of this document is to offer a construct for clinicians in the cardiovascular field with regards to (1) diagnosis and screening of MASLD through the use of noninvasive serum and imaging tests; (2) screening for CVD in all individuals with MASLD regardless of established atherosclerotic risk factors; and (3) the approach to management of MASLD with respect to prevention of CVD through lifestyle, as well as pharmacologic and surgical strategies. To achieve this, the modified Delphi method was applied and a series of evidence-based quality standard recommendations have been identified.",,,

In an effort to overcome these limitations, we hereby develop and experimentally validate a finite-element (FE)-based algorithm, including a novel cross-shear and contact pressure dependent wear and creep model, and apply it towards understanding the sensitivity of wear outcomes to the applied boundary conditions. Specifically, we investigated the application of in vivo data for level walking from the publicly available ""Stan"" data set, which contains single representative tibiofemoral loads and kinematics derived from in vivo measurements of six subjects, and compared wear outcomes against those obtained using the ISO standard boundary conditions. To provide validation of the numerical models, this comparison was reproduced experimentally on a six-station knee wear simulator over 5 million cycles, testing the same implant Stan's data was obtained from. Experimental implementation of Stan's boundary conditions in displacement control resulted in approximately three times higher wear rates (4.4 vs. 1.6 mm The FE wear model is suitable for supporting future patient-specific models and development of novel implant designs. Incorporating the Stan data set alongside ISO boundary conditions emphasized the value of using measured kinematics in displacement control for reliably replicating in vivo joint mechanics in wear simulation.

The authors hypothesize PCT allows regression of peritoneal inflammation, but infundibular inflammation is increased at interval cholecystectomy, resulting in greater requirement for advanced dissection techniques. Between December 2009 and July 2023, 1222 patients were admitted with acute cholecystitis and ultimately underwent cholecystectomy. Of these 1222 patients, there were 876 patients that underwent urgent (within 10 days) cholecystectomy (UrgSurg), 170 patients underwent interval cholecystectomy (10 or more days) after antibiotic therapy (IntMed), and 175 patients that underwent PCT and interval cholecystectomy (IntTube). Minimally invasive operation was attempted in all patients. Patient demographics, comorbidities, surgical techniques (Critical View of Safety (CVS), infundibulum down, fundus-down, subtotal fenestrating, subtotal reconstituting, and conversion to open operation), and surgical outcomes were reviewed retrospectively. Multivariate logistic regression was performed to identify if interval cholecystectomy was independently associated with more advanced dissection techniques or reinterventions. Compared to the UrgSurg and IntMed patients, IntTube patients were significantly older (Median: 60 vs 66 vs 68, P < 0.001) and more often male (41.7% vs 47.6% vs 72.2%, P < 0.001). Additionally, IntTube patients were more likely to have medical comorbidities. Establishment of CVS was significantly less frequent in IntTube patients (61%) compared to UrgSurg patients (86%) and IntMed patients (85.9%) in unadjusted analysis (OR 0.26, P < 0.001) and in multivariable analysis after adjusting for potential confounders (OR 0.31, P < 0.001). There was no incidence of biliary injury, and no difference in rates of biliary reintervention among groups.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the nerve regeneration ability of Bio 3D conduits made from UC-MSCs using a rat sciatic nerve defect model. A Bio 3D conduit was fabricated using a Bio 3D printer by placing UC-MSC spheroids into thin needles according to predesigned 3D data. The conduit was transplanted to bridge the 5-mm gaps of Lewis rat sciatic nerve, and nerve regeneration was evaluated at 8 weeks (Bio 3D group). Transplantation of autologous nerve segments (autograft) and silicone tubes represented the positive and negative control groups, respectively. In a second experiment, immunological reactions were evaluated in Bio 3D, autograft, and allograft groups by histochemical staining of transplanted segments in Brown Norway rats. The mean angle of attack value in the kinematic analysis was significantly better in the Bio 3D group (‒20.1 ± 0.5°) than in the silicone group (‒33.7 ± 1.5°) 8 weeks after surgery. The average diameters of myelinated axons were significantly larger in the Bio 3D group (3.61 ± 0.15 μm) than in the silicone group (3.07 ± 0.12 μm), and the number of myelinated axons was significantly higher in the Bio 3D group (11,201 ± 980) than in the silicone group (8117 ± 646). Histological findings (hematoxylin and eosin [HE] staining and anti-CD3 fluorescent immunostaining) showed that rejection was suppressed in the Bio 3D group compared to the allograft group. Based on macroscopic findings and histological findings (anti-human mitochondrial fluorescent immunostaining), UC-MSCs in the Bio 3D conduit disappeared gradually from week 1 to week 8. The Bio 3D conduit prepared from UC-MSCs was superior to the silicone tube and achieved comparable nerve regeneration to the autologous (autograft) group. Rejection was suppressed in the Bio 3D group compared to the allograft group. Although this study used a xenograft model, we speculate that rejection was low due to the characteristics of UC-MSCs.

39710220,Multiphysics modelling of the impact of skin deformation and strain on microneedle-based transdermal therapeutic delivery.,2025-04-29,Acta biomaterialia,10.1016/j.actbio.2024.12.053,"Microneedle patches (MNs) hold enormous potential to facilitate the minimally-invasive delivery of drugs and vaccines transdermally. However, the micro-mechanics of skin deformation significantly influence the permeation of therapeutics through the skin. Previous studies often fail to appreciate the complexities in microneedle-skin mechanical interactions. This may impede the accuracy of MNs pre-clinical assessments. Here, we develop a multiphysics finite element model which simulates the biomechanics of microneedle skin penetration and the subsequent permeation of therapeutics. Employing the aqueous pore path hypothesis, we consider how strain (induced through the insertion of a MN), affects pore geometry in the skin and therefore the diffusion of therapeutics. Our models show that considering the insertion-induced skin deformation alone reduces the transdermal permeation of insulin by 25 %, while considering the effect of strain can reduce the overall permeation by a further 45 % over 24 h. Our model also indicates that once the mechanical strain is removed i.e. through removal or dissolution of the array, the permeation through the skin will recover. Furthermore, our results indicate that the delivery of high molecular weight compounds may be most susceptible to strain-induced changes in drug permeation. These findings could have significant implications for the preferred type of microneedle administration when targeting, for example, intradermal or transdermal delivery. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: This manuscript presents an advanced computational model of microneedle insertion into human skin. Here, we adopt a multiphysics modelling strategy, where we predict the influence of microneedle insertion on skin deformation and strain and how that influences subsequent therapeutic permeation through the skin. Our model predicts that whether or not the microneedle remains in situ, the resultant change in tissue deformation and strain has a major impact on how quickly the therapeutic diffuses through the skin. This has important implications for transdermal device design, administration strategies and protocols and associated clinical studies, where either intradermal or transdermal therapeutic delivery is being targetted.",,,aisling.niannaidh@ucd.ie.

Cell based approaches have shown progress. However, these have been associated with high costs and logistical challenges. Acellular meshes were engineered using liquid collagen. They underwent in vitro, mechanical and bench testing by surgeons. Sixty-nine male New Zealand rabbits were used to refine the design. The final prototype based on the TissueSpan patented technology was then implanted again in a 2 cm long urethral defect in 9 rabbits and in a 4 cm long defect in 6 dogs. The TissueSpan technology platform allows for the manufacturing of tubular and rectangular meshes in different diameters and thicknesses. The tubular mesh acted as physical conduit to gap the urethral defect with a patent urethra demonstrated after 1month in both animal models. The mesh was absorbed within 1-3months. Spontaneous urothelial coverage of the mesh and smooth muscle cell migration into the surgical area was demonstrated even in a 4 cm long urethral defect. A first in man clinical trial was subsequently initiated. The acellular mesh may have the potential to be an off-the-shelf product for substitution urethroplasty.

By combining physical and cognitive training components, they aim to preserve independence in older adults and reduce their risk of falling. This study explored whether primary end users (PEU, healthy older adults and patients with neurological and geriatric diagnoses) and secondary end users (SEU, health professionals) evaluated the ExerG functional model to be usable, providing a positive experience and therefore acceptable. We conducted a multi-methods study using several assessments to quantify usability and enjoyment outcomes, along with semi-structured interviews to gain an in-depth understanding of the users' experiences. Descriptive statistics were used for quantitative outcome measures. For qualitative data, a thematic analysis (TA) using an inductive, data-driven approach was carried out to develop themes for each user group. We interviewed 20 PEUs (13 healthy older adults, 7 patients) and 22 SEUs at two rehabilitation centres in Austria and Switzerland. Users' scores of over 70 on the System Usability Scale denoted good usability. On the Physical Activity Enjoyment Scale-16, both PEU groups rated the ExerG highly. Our TA approach identified four themes per user group. Themes from both PEU groups confirmed their enjoyment of training with the ExerG, however more variety and greater challenges were requested. Whilst the patient group appreciated the security given by the harness system, the healthy older adults reported feeling restricted. SEU themes reflected their approval of this novel training device, although a desire for increased difficulty and more individualisation was expressed. Clear instructions and an easy-to-use harness system were acknowledged and useful feedback for the developers emerged. The ExerG is usable, offers a positive experience, and can therefore be regarded as an acceptable solution for the combined physical and mental training of older adults. Our findings contribute to the ongoing development of the ExerG, which will be a welcome addition to current training options for this target group.

Vascular and endothelial cell changes appear to precede other features of SSc. Retinal vascular analysis is a new, easy-to-use tool for the assessment of retinal microvascular function. The primary aim of this study was to investigate whether retinal microcirculation is affected in patients with SSc compared to healthy controls. Microvascular function was assessed non-invasively measuring flicker-light induced vasodilation of retinal arterioles (FIDart%). In addition, FID of retinal venules (FIDven%), central retinal arteriolar and venular equivalents (CRAE and CRVE), and measurements of flow-mediated vasodilation (FMD) of the brachial artery, pulse wave velocity (PWV) and pulse wave analysis were obtained. Patients with SSc were prospectively enrolled in the study (n = 40, mean age 56 ± 11 years, females 73 %) and compared with age- and sex-matched healthy controls (HC, n = 40; mean age 59 ± 15 years, females 73 %). Patients with SSc showed significant impairment of retinal microvascular function compared to age- and gender-matched HC (FIDart%: 2.23 ± 2.0 % vs. 3.1 ± 1.9 %, respectively, p = 0.04). FMD and PWV were not significantly different between the groups. Impaired retinal microvascular function was associated with SSc disease duration. Our study shows a significant impairment of retinal microvascular function in patients with SSc. Because this association seems to be independent of CV risk and dependent on disease duration, retinal vessel analysis may have the potential to serve as a tool for risk assessment and prognosis.",,,andreas.flammer@usz.ch.

However, established outcome measures are insufficient regarding measurement quality criteria (e.g., reliability, objectivity) or functional relevance. Wearables such as data gloves might be helpful, allowing repeated quantification of complex everyday life-relevant motor function of the hand. 25 patients with chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy or multifocal motor neuropathy were followed-up at five time points during maintenance therapy with intravenous immunoglobulin. 14 of them showed clinically relevant hand motor impairment. We examined the patients' hand function using a data glove which quantifies the active range of motion (ROM) of the hand based on three different movement patterns. In addition, clinical outcome parameters (grip strength measurement, MRC Sum Score, INCAT disability score), nerve conduction studies (NCS), and high-resolution ultrasound (HRUS) were performed, and patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) like the Rasch-built Overall Disability Scale (R-ODS) were assessed. We calculated correlation coefficients, performed Receiver Operating Characteristic analysis, as well as correlation analyses for the glove data and clinical outcome parameters. Longitudinal analyses were based on a Linear Mixed Model, and we assessed construct validity of the data glove by analyzing correlations between the glove measurements and well-established clinical parameters. We found good to excellent test-retest reliability for the ROM in all glove movement patterns (Intraclass correlation coefficients = 0.83-0.94), underlining the ability to capture clinical stability. Moreover, the glove demonstrated adequate, sensitivity and specificity in detecting hand motor impairment (area under the curve (AUC): 0.714-0.780), and it performed better than NCS and HRUS (AUC: 0.552/0.701). The AUC values for the metrically scaled parameters include: Vigorimeter (AUC: 0.929) and R-ODS (AUC: 0.698). Additionally, the data glove proved to be a valid tool, as we demonstrated moderate to strong, significant correlations between the glove and established clinical parameters (especially Vigorimeter), as well as PROMs (especially R-ODS). This data glove allowed for a non-invasive assessment of the hand motor function and yielded investigator-independent results that reliably reflected individual functional deficits with relevance to everyday life. Future studies should explore the ability to predict clinically meaningful responses to immunomodulatory treatment and to support and monitor rehabilitation progress, with potential applications in other neurological diseases as well.

The current study investigated the association of the use of interdental cleaning devices with oral health outcomes such as tooth loss among employees as a healthier population. Tooth loss was determined as the main outcome in 2017 in a company employee population (n = 845, average age = 47.76 years old, and 25.09% of female). Using the data of dental health examinations in the past 5-years from 2017, the years of use of interdental brushes (IDB) and dental floss (DF) were examined. The Community Periodontal Index (CPI) as of 5-years ago was also examined. The impact of years of use of IDB and DF on tooth loss was analyzed by a logistic regression model in stratifying the subjects into two groups by the maximum CPI (0-2 of CPI [< 4 mm] and 3-4 of CPI [≥ 4 mm]) in all periodontium. In the group of maximum CPI < 3, a multivariate-adjusted odds ratio of the use of DF for 4-5 years on tooth loss was 0.42 versus for 0-1 year (reference). In the group of maximum CPI ≥ 3, the multivariate-adjusted odds ratio of the use of IDB for 4-5 years was 0.38 versus for 0-1 year (reference). A longer-term use of interdental cleaning devices could improve oral health outcomes in this population, while the impact could differ depending on the basis of periodontal status. These findings would be useful for making strategies for oral health promotion in healthier people as employees.",Ishikawa M; Yasuda T,Sunstar Inc.,kazukotani@jichi.ac.jp.

Near-infrared transcranial photobiomodulation (tPBM) is a safe neurostimulation modality with potential antidepressant and hypnotic effects. We investigated the feasibility and efficacy of adjunctive tPBM treatment, self-administered by a wearable headband. We randomized 48 outpatients with major depressive disorder (MDD) into tPBM or sham with 1:1 ratio. All participants were advised to receive the device-based intervention for at least 20 min daily at their preferred time and place for 8 weeks. The compliance and adverse events were monitored throughout the trial. The Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD), Beck's Depression Inventory (BDI) and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) were used to evaluate the symptoms from baseline until week-12. Participants reported this self-administered intervention well-tolerated. Treatment compliance was equally good between various group-comparisons, and the adverse effects were minimal and transient. Post-treatment, the HAMD and BDI scores of patients in both tPBM group and sham group significantly decreased compared to baseline, with no between-group difference. However, a significant PSQI score reduction was only found in tPBM group from week-2 onward compared with baseline, with significant between-group difference lasting until week-12 (F This smaller sample size and short treatment and follow-up durations. Self-administered wearable tPBM appears to be a feasible and well-tolerated in MDD patients.

The study was also to evaluate the impact of shock therapy on depression development and long-term prognosis. The prospective study encompassed 396 consecutive heart failure (HF) patients implanted with CRT-D. All patients completed the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II) and underwent a psychiatric examination at baseline. 221 patients free of depressive symptoms at baseline were included into the final analysis. The assessment of psychiatric status was routinely repeated every 6 months as well as after the shock delivery. The primary outcome was a composite endpoint of death or hospitalization for HF. During long-term observation (median 37.1 months) 52 (23.5%) patients suffered from an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) shock, whereas 48 (21.8%) subjects developed depression. The incidence of new-onset depression was significantly higher in patients after shock delivery (Shock Group), CRT non-responders and subjects with atrial fibrillation. The risk for a composite endpoint was higher in the Shock Group than subjects without an ICD intervention: 57.7% vs. 25.4% and in patients with new-onset depression compared to the population free of this disorder: 62.5% vs. 24.9% (all p < 0.001). New-onset depression (HR 1.7) and an ICD shock (HR 2.1) were strong independent predictors of poor prognosis. Depression is a common mental disorder in CRT-D recipients, that adversely affects long-term prognosis. Subjects suffering from ICD shocks and those with HF progression are at higher risk of experiencing depressive symptoms.",,,tomekpod@interia.pl.

Eighty-two (82) participants were recruited from 5 clinical sites in the United States. Each participant performed self-collect sampling using the self-collect device followed by a standard of care clinician-collected sample. Both samples were evaluated for hrHPV using polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based HPV assays. A subset of HPV-positive samples underwent dual staining (p16/Ki-67), and concordance was evaluated. Biopsy results collected per standard of care were recorded. On the Roche cobas assay, the preliminary positive percent agreement (PPA) and negative percent agreement (NPA) was 91%. Agreement for hrHPV using the BD OnClarity in PreservCyt was 100% PPA (n = 10), and 100% PPA, 93% NPA in SurePath. Dual-stain concordance was 93% (n = 16) overall, and 100% for HPV other genotypes. Seventy-one participants (n = 71; 89%) indicated they would feel confident using the self-collect device for screening if they knew they could get equal results, and 86% (n = 69) indicated that they would be more likely to get screened with this option. The self-collect device shows high (>92%) positive and negative agreement for detection of HPV when compared with reference clinician-collected samples, with very high acceptability and preference. Furthermore, the self-samples collected with the self-collect device showed highly concordant results by dual stain, which is a novel and emerging application for a self-collected sampling device, thus enabling potential triage from 1 sample.",Crane L; Fitzpatrick MB; Sutton E; Favreau J; Young S; Young J,; Planned Parenthood Gulf Coast; Woman's Health Foundation; TriCore Reference Laboratories; Crescendo MD,

The development of a sensitive, accurate, and rapid detection method for respiratory viruses is crucial for disease prevention and control. However, existing methods are inadequate in satisfying the demand for accurate and convenient detection simultaneously. Therefore, an ultrasensitive point-of-care testing (POCT) platform based on a multiple aptamer recognition-based quantum dot lateral flow immunoassay (MARQ-LFIA) was developed in this work. This platform consisted of multiple high-affinity aptamers for recognizing different sites on a respiratory infectious virus protein, enhancing the efficiency of virus identification in complex environments. By combining a multiple aptamer recognition strategy with quantum dot fluorescent technique to construct LFIA test strips and pairing them with a high-gain portable fluorescence reader, excellent detection sensitivity and specificity were achieved in the case of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

Stimulating the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) with deep Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (dTMS) could lead to shifts in affective bias. The current study examined behavioral and neural correlates of affective bias in the context of dTMS in adolescents with treatment-resistant depression (TRD). Adolescents completed a Word-Face Stroop (WFS) task during an fMRI scan before and after 30 sessions of dTMS targeting the left dlPFC. In the task, participants were shown words superimposed on faces in either a ""congruent"" (both word and face were positive or both negative) or an ""incongruent"" fashion; in both cases, participants identified whether the words were positive or negative. We examined pre-post intervention neural and behavioral WFS changes and their correlations with clinical improvement. Usable pre- and post-intervention WFS data were available for 10 adolescents with TRD (Age, years: M = 16.3, SD = 1.09) for behavioral data; 9 for neuroimaging data. After treatment, although changes in behavioral performance did not suggest improved affective bias, amygdala activation decreased during the negative word/happy face condition, which correlated with clinical improvement. Overall, clinical improvement correlated with decreased neural activation during congruent conditions. Major limitations include the small sample size, lack of a sham control group, and unknown psychometric properties. Preliminary findings suggesting improving neural efficiency and normalizing affective bias in those with the most clinical improvement highlight the potential importance of targeting affective bias in treating adolescents with TRD.",Croarkin PE,Department of Psychiatry and Psychology,nair0035@umn.edu.

Part A, Molecular and biomolecular spectroscopy",10.1016/j.saa.2024.125608,"Culture media are widely used for biological research and production. It is essential for the growth of microorganisms, cells, or tissues. It includes complex components like carbohydrates, proteins, vitamins, and minerals. The media's consistency is key for predictable outcomes in biology applications. However, traditional methods of analyzing media are costly and time-consuming by using chromatography or mass spectrometry. This study introduces an innovative approach using optimized convolutional neural networks (CNN) combined with Raman spectroscopy to identify culture media. Samples of culture media from different models and batches are prepared for identification experiment. Raman spectra of each culture media samples are captured with unique molecular vibrations and rotations by Raman spectrometer rapidly. After preprocessing of sample data, Raman spectra are input to CNN for identification training and validation. An optimized CNN with more layers is designed to enhance the identify ability for Raman spectra. In experiment, it compared the performance of PCA-SVM, the original CNN, and an optimized CNN for media identification. The PCA-SVM achieved high accuracy and precision rates of 99.19% and 98.39% respectively. The original CNN achieved an accuracy of 71.89% due to limited training dataset. The optimized CNN model achieved a perfect accuracy rate of 100% in identifying different culture media. To avoid overfitting risk, additional external test is performed with optimized CNN. The result confirmed that optimized CNN offering effectiveness in identifying media from different models and batches, with strong generalization ability. The findings in study may offer an efficient and cost-effective method for pharmaceutical companies, to ensure the consistency of culture media.",Li X,Jiangsu Simcere Zaiming Pharmaceutical Co.,xwzhao@seu.edu.cn.

Nevertheless, the judgments made by decision-makers often possess a degree of fuzziness and uncertainty, rendering the sole reliance on precise values inadequate for representing real-world scenarios. To address this issue, our study extends the DEMATEL approach to more effectively and efficiently handle intuitionistic fuzzy information, which denotes the factor correlation information from decision-makers in the form of intuitionistic fuzzy terms. The paper aggregates the intuitionistic fuzzy correlation information from each decision-maker, employing operators designed for managing intuitionistic fuzzy numbers. The significance and categorization of factors are determined through intuitionistic fuzzy matrix operations. Additionally, a causal and effect diagram is constructed to elucidate the distinct roles of these factors. Finally, this study illustrates the applicability of our proposed method with a real-world case in the context of electric vehicles (EVs). The study's results identify four cause factors and six effect factors within EV battery technology. The identification and categorization of these factors will assist EV companies in implementing targeted measures to foster the advancement of the battery technology.",,,

Sequential EPID images for VMAT plans were acquired every 0.4-second by iView system and processed through iterative deconvolution to mitigate blurring from photon scattering. Deconvolved images were binarized to define multi-leaf collimator (MLC) positions. Pre-acquired box fluences determined optimal threshold for binarization and adjusted for detector shift depending on gantry and collimator angles. Sequential EPID images were re-scaled using pixel scaling factor (PSF) and converted to monitor unit (MU) proportional values. Generated EPID-based log file, including control-point specific MLC and monitor units (MU) information, were analyzed in Mobius3D for Gamma passing rate (GPR) of VMAT plans from 18 patients. Plan complexity indices were calculated and correlated with GPR. Clinically appropriate threshold was defined to be 20000 that can extract accurate MLC data from the deconvolved binarized EPID images. Positional deviations due to gantry and collimator rotations were observed to be up to 4.5 pixels. Recalibrated EPID pixel values showed linearity with MU regardless of changes in dose rate. Consequently, average GPR for 18 patients evaluated using Mobius3D reached 95.2% ± 3.7%%, based on 3% dose difference and 3mm distance-to-agreement criterion. It was found that two plan complexity indices showed statistically significant correlation with GPR. This study successfully implemented novel measurement-based VMAT QA framework based on control-point specific EPID, based upon accurate MLC and MU data at each frame.",,,

The present study aims to inform the most recent data on the strength of clinical evidence supporting such approvals. Evidentiary characteristics of pre-approval pivotal clinical studies and regulator-required post-approval confirmatory studies supporting AAs between 2015 and 2022 were extracted from publicly available FDA documents. Descriptive analyses were conducted for each of the characteristic including study design, study phase, primary endpoint, number of participants, and magnitude of effect. Trends of these characteristics over time were documented and accounted for class of drugs, application type, novelty, orphan status, and oncology/non-oncology indications. During 2015-2022, 156 drug-indication pairs received AA. To support these AAs, 77% of pre-approval pivotal trials employed single-arm designs, and 22% were phase I trials, with a median of 92 participants (IQR, 45-125); 61% of post-approval confirmatory studies were required by FDA to use randomized controlled design, 25% to use clinical endpoints, and 33% specified the number of participants requirement. During the 8-year observation period, the pairs approved via AA pathway almost tripled from 20 (2015-2016) to 59 (2019-2020) and fell to 36 (2021-2022); the corresponding proportion to all new drug approvals showed the same trend. Single-arm pre-approval pivotal studies increased from 55% (2015-2016) to 91% (2019-2020) and fell to 69% (2021-2022), while the median number of participants decreased from 106 (2015-2016) to 59 (2019-2020) and rose to 106 (2021-2022). Randomized controlled post-approval confirmatory studies decreased from 75% (2015-2016) to 42% (2019-2020) and rebounded to 75% (2021-2022), while those using surrogate endpoints increased from 50% (2015-2016) to 72% (2021-2022). Analyses adjusting for drug class, application type, novelty, orphan status, and oncology/non-oncology showed similar results.

There is no general consensus regarding the surgical treatment, but most surgeons recommend internal fixation of the coronoid along with primary ligament repair. This methodology involves postoperative immobilization to allow ligament healing, occasionally associated with stiffness. Augmentation of one/or both collateral ligaments using a non-absorbable suture tape as an internal brace in VPMRI cases was the subject of the presented study. This method allows brace-free initiation of full elbow range of motion while protecting bony and soft tissue healing. 17 patients (13 males and four females) with VPMRI were treated in the center from 2017 to 2021 with internal brace augmentation of collateral ligament along with ORIF (Open reduction & internal fixation)/ reconstruction of the coronoid fragment. All patients were actively mobilized early after surgery. Patients who completed a minimum follow up of 24 months were included in the study. Clinical examination findings at follow-up assessment included ROM (range of motion) recording and instability testing, including special instability tests such as moving valgus stress test, lateral pivot shift test, Posterolateral rotatory drawer test, and gravity-assisted varus stress test. Disabilities of arm, shoulder and hand (DASH) score, Mayo Elbow Performance Score (MEPS), Oxford Elbow Score (OES), Visual Analogue Score (VAS), and SEV (Simple Elbow values) were assessed and noted at follow-up. At 43 months of mean follow-up, none of the patients had significant postoperative contracture, and none had any clinically apparent signs of instability or suffered subluxation or re-dislocation. Postoperative radiographs showed complete fracture/graft healing with no signs of subluxation in all patients.

Lesions in an adult and a 10-year-old-child body phantom were imitated using iodine solutions of different concentrations. Phantoms were subjected to several SECT and DECT thoracic and abdominal scans using a rapid kV-switching DECT scanner. The contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) of each lesion was measured on resulting SECT images and virtual monoenergetic images (VMI) available from DECT. The SECT scans that resulted in CNR values similar to the maximum CNR observed in VMIs derived from corresponding DECT scans were identified. SECT and DECT scans with equivalent lesion-discriminating power were compared regarding the associated radiation dose burden. Doses to the lung, breast, and esophagus from thoracic imaging and doses to the liver, kidneys, and stomach from abdominal imaging were determined through Monte Carlo simulations of SECT and DECT exposures. Compared to SECT imaging of the adult body phantom, organ doses from DECT were found to be 5-11% lower in thoracic imaging and 44-45% lower in abdominal imaging. Compared to SECT imaging of the 10-year-old body phantom, organ doses from DECT were found to be 2.8-3.4 times higher in thoracic imaging and 1.5-1.6 times higher in abdominal imaging. The use of rapid kV-switching DECT instead of SECT imaging may be associated with a similar or lower dose burden in adults but a noticeably higher dose burden in children. Question How does the radiation exposure from single-energy and dual-energy CT imaging compare when both techniques provide equivalent lesion identification power? Findings Rapid kV-switching dual-energy CT compared to single-energy CT may result in a similar or lower radiation dose in adults, but higher radiation dose in children. Clinical relevance Rapid kV-switching dual-energy CT imaging in children should be preferred over single-energy CT imaging only in cases where the additional information provided is crucial for an effective diagnosis.",,,perisynk@uoc.gr.

We tested for interaction effects between baseline characteristics (age, sex, socio-professional background, body mass index, insulin daily dose, carbohydrate counting practice) and treatment effect. We included 245 patients (58% women): 178 treated with Control-IQ and 67 with MiniMed 780G. The mean ± SD age and haemoglobin A1c were 39 ± 15 years and 8.7 ± 1.8% (72 ± 20 mmol/mol) respectively. In the propensity score-matched sample (n = 221), we observed significant differences in 12-month TIR (MiniMed 780G minus Control-IQ [95% CI]: 6.4 [3.4;9.5]), GMI (-0.42 [-0.59; -0.25]) and CV (-2.12 [-3.68; -0.55]), while TBR showed no significant difference (-0.04 [-0.47; +0.40]). The 12-month TIR difference was consistent across subgroups, including baseline carbohydrate counting characteristics. MiniMed 780G is associated with moderate metabolic superiority compared to Control-IQ, without interaction with patient characteristics. These results suggest that neither model is more appropriate for certain populations, particularly patients without carbohydrate counting practice.",,,

However, thiamethoxam is prone to loss during practical applications, especially in soil application, which seriously reduces its performance. In this work, thiamethoxam is loaded in ethyl cellulose microspheres to solve this issue, and the thiamethoxam-loaded ethyl cellulose microspheres (thiamethoxam/EC) are facilely and effectively fabricated by emulsified solvent volatilization. The exceptional embedding capacity of thiamethoxam/EC was elucidated through a systematic investigation of its controlled release and antiphotolysis properties. The encapsulation efficiency of thiamethoxam/EC was found to be ∼70.36%. Even after 130 h in a phosphate-buffered saline solution, the release of thiamethoxam from the thiamethoxam/EC complex continued, with a cumulative release of ∼52.38%. In contrast, the cumulative release of thiamethoxam/EC in soil after being flushed with 580 mL of water was a mere 14.74%, significantly lower than the value of 42.73% observed for unencapsulated thiamethoxam at the same volume.

This prospective IRB-approved, HIPAA-compliant pilot study enrolled adults with overweight or obesity. Participants underwent chemical-shift-encoded magnetic resonance imaging to estimate proton density fat fraction (PDFF) and, within 1 mo, QUS with a POCUS device by expert sonographers and novice operators (no prior US scanning experience). Radiofrequency data from the liver collected with the POCUS device were analyzed offline using probe-specific calibrations to estimate two QUS parameters: attenuation coefficient (AC) and backscatter coefficient (BSC). Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of each parameter was estimated for classifying presence/absence of hepatic steatosis (defined as PDFF ≥ 5%). Spearman rank correlation between each parameter and PDFF was estimated and its significance assessed. Of 18 participants (mean age, 43 y ± 14; 17 women), 8 had hepatic steatosis (PDFF ≥ 5%). Both AC and BSC classified hepatic steatosis accurately with AUCs of 0.96-0.97 for expert and 0.88-0.89 for novice operators (p < 0.01 for all) and correlated significantly with PDFF with rho's of 0.65-0.69 for expert and 0.58-0.65 for novice operators (p < 0.02 for all).

A total of 797 eyes that had been fitted with CRT lenses and demonstrated good lens centration with plus power ring intact in their topography were retrospectively included. A comprehensive AI model included spherical refraction, keratometry readings, eccentricity, corneal astigmatism, horizontal visible iris diameter, inferior-superior index, surface asymmetry index, surface regularity index and 8-mm chordal corneal height difference. A simplified AI model omitted the latter four parameters. Correlation and disparity in predicted lens parameters between the AI prediction and manufacturer's conventional lens fitting method were compared. There was overall no significant difference between AI predicted parameters and the final ordered parameters (p > 0.05). The horizontal return zone depth (RZD1, p = 0.022) and vertical return zone depth (RZD2, p < 0.001) values suggested by the conventional method were significantly lower, while the horizontal landing zone angle (LZA1) was significantly larger (p = 0.002) than those of the final ordered lens. The AI predicted parameters were significantly correlated to those of the final ordered lens (p < 0.01), with the correlation coefficients of base curve radius (BCR), RZD1, RZD2, LZA1, vertical LZA (LZA2) and total lens diameter (TD) being 0.958, 0.708, 0.773, 0.697, 0.654 and 0.730, respectively, for the comprehensive AI model. The correlation coefficients were higher in RZD2, LZA1 and TD with the AI model as compared to conventional method. Compared with the conventional method, AI predicted lens parameters exhibit less disparity and improved accuracy, with a potential to facilitate more efficient and precise CRT OK lens fitting.",Wang C,MediWorks Precision Instruments Company Limited,peter459@aliyun.com.

The purpose of this article is to evaluate the ability of computed tomography (CT)-based preoperative templating to accurately predict implant sizes. A total of 724 Stryker MAKO robotic-assisted TKA cases were retrospectively evaluated from a prospectively collected database between January 2020 and October 2023. Cases were performed by one of three adult reconstruction fellowship-trained orthopaedic surgeons from a health system that includes an academic level one trauma center, an ambulatory surgery center, and a community hospital. Out of the 724 cases, 391 were preoperatively templated independently by the surgeon and the company representative (MAKO Product Specialist [MPS]). The remaining 333 cases were only templated prior to incision by the MPS. Final implant sizes of the tibial and femoral components were compared to preoperative templates. The MPS was able to preoperatively predict the final tibial and femoral implants within one size in 97.2 and 97.8% of cases, respectively. A surgeon and MPS combined preoperative templating increased accuracy to predict the final tibial and femoral implants within one size in 98.9 and 99.5% of cases, respectively.

In this study, the utility of the QIAstat-Dx syndromic device for influenza surveillance was evaluated. Bioinformatic analysis was performed on all WHO-recommended influenza Candidate Vaccine Viruses (CVVs), including the common strains recommended for the 2023-2024 influenza vaccine composition in the northern hemisphere, and 16 different H5 highly pathogenic avian influenza virus (HPAIV) and two H9N2 low pathogenic avian influenza virus (LPAIV) strains. For laboratory validation, engineered gene fragments and real HPAIV and LPAIV samples were tested using the QIAstat-Dx Respiratory SARS-CoV-2 Panel. During the bioinformatic screening, common influenza strains were positive including influenza A subtypes, and all H5 HPAIV and LPAIV H9N2 were detected as Influenza A positive without subtype discrimination. In all cases, laboratory validation confirmed all bioinformatic results. QIAstat-Dx can detect all tested potentially zoonotic influenza A virus strains, and discriminate them from human sesonal influenza A viruses, ensuring a correct diagnosis.

A popular weightlifting exercise is the deadlift, which targets multiple muscle groups including the lower back, glutes, and hamstrings. However, incorrect technique (i.e., poor form) can slow training progress, result in asymmetrical muscle development, and cause serious injuries. The objective of this study was to validate that a self-adhesive, elastic fabric, wearable, skin-strain sensor called Motion Tape (MT) could monitor a person's posture while performing deadlift exercises. Two pairs of Motion Tape were attached on the front and back sides of the pelvis at each posterior superior iliac spine to record muscle engagement during deadlift exercises. The results of this preliminary study confirmed that the MT identified asymmetry in muscle engagement during deadlifting repetitions. In addition, the sensors could quantify the different levels of effort exerted according to the deadlift weight load.",Sten D; Wareham R,S10 Fitness,

Impedance measurements were obtained from 21 participants during surgery and at four postoperative stages. Monopolar impedances were recorded using the Bionic Ear Data Collection System (BEDCS) and the Active Insertion Monitoring (AIM) system. Three- and four-point impedances were recorded directly using BEDCS, and indirect three-point impedances were additionally derived from Electrical Field Imaging matrices recorded using BEDCS or AIM. There was an 11% relative error between monopolar measurements from BEDCS and AIM and a 25% discrepancy between direct and indirect three-point measurements. Despite this, direct and indirect measurements from both systems were useful for tracking postoperative impedance shifts. Three- and four-point measurements showed a strong relationship both during and after surgery. Our results suggest that three- and four-point measurements are more specific than monopolar impedances in capturing localized tissue changes. Three- and four-point impedance measurements are potential markers of intracochlear tissue changes over time. While direct three-point impedance measurements offer higher accuracy, indirect measurements provide a feasible alternative for monitoring intracochlear changes in clinical settings lacking the option of direct measurements.",,,

The surface electromyographic (sEMG) signals of four muscles, namely the biceps femoris (BF), gluteus maximus (GM), semimembranosus (SM), and semitendinosus (ST), were collected to evaluate the performance of the robot. The experimental results show that the exoskeleton robot could reduce the root mean square (RMS) values of the sEMG signals of the main force-generating muscles related to the hip joint.

Lind. has significant medicinal and economic value, and the social demand for this species is increasing annually. Laser light sources have different luminescent mechanisms compared with ordinary light sources and are also important factors regulating the synthesis of functional metabolites in A. roxburghii. However, the regulatory mechanism through which A. roxburghii responds to blue laser light has not been investigated. Previous studies have shown that blue-laser treatment results in more red leaves than blue- or white-light treatment. Here, the differences in the effects of laser treatment on A. roxburghii were analyzed by transcriptome sequencing. Gene Ontology analysis revealed that the membranes, calcium ion binding, brassinosteroid-mediated signaling pathway and response to salicylic acid play important roles in the response of A. roxburghii to blue laser light. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes analysis revealed the involvement of multiple pathways in the response to blue-laser treatment, and among these, beta biosynthesis, flavone and flavonol biosynthesis, thiamine metabolism, limonene and pinene biosynthesis, and peroxisomes play core roles. Cytoscape interaction analysis of the differentially expressed miRNA targets indicated that novel_miR_66, novel_miR_78 and novel_miR_212 were most likely involved in the effect of blue laser light on A. roxburghii. Metabolic content measurements showed that blue laser light increased the beet red pigment, thiamine, total flavonoid and limonene contents, and qPCR analysis confirmed that novel_miR_21, novel_miR_66, novel_miR_188 and novel_miR_194 might participate in the blue-laser signaling network through their target genes and thereby regulate the functional metabolite accumulation in A. roxburghii.

The mosaicplasty technique is one of the most commonly used methods for deep lesions. The all-arthroscopic technique with scaffold and autograft bone taken from the tibial plafond is a novel method as an alternative to the mosaicplasty. This study aims to compare the clinical and radiological results of these two different surgical techniques in the treatment of deep OLT. From September 2019 to July 2021, 30 patients with deep osteochondral lesions of the talus were randomly divided into two groups for either mosaicplasty or the all-arthroscopic technique, and they were evaluated prospectively. American Orthopedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) ankle-hindfoot scale and visual analog scale (VAS) scores were evaluated within and between groups preoperatively and postoperatively. Radiological assessments were performed at 6th and 12th month postoperatively according to the magnetic resonance observation of cartilage repair tissue (MOCART) scale. Mosaicplasty was applied to 15 patients, and all-arthroscopic technique was applied to 15 patients. 14 of the patients were female and 16 were male; the mean age was 38.1. Within-group evaluations revealed significant improvements in AOFAS and VAS scores at postoperative 6th and 12th months (p < 0.05). There was no significant difference between the treatment groups in comparison of clinical scores at any time period. There was no significant difference between the two methods according to the total MOCART scores (p > 0.05). However, the all-arthroscopic technique was more successful in terms of ""border integration"" and ""repair tissue structure"" (p < 0.05). Age, body mass index (BMI) and lesion surface area were not correlated with clinical scores. In terms of clinical and radiological scores, similar results were obtained in the treatment groups.

39679851,The effect of sample site and collection procedure on identification of SARS-CoV-2 infection.,2024-12-16,The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,10.1002/14651858.CD014780,"Sample collection is a key driver of accuracy in the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Viral load may vary at different anatomical sampling sites and accuracy may be compromised by difficulties obtaining specimens and the expertise of the person taking the sample. It is important to optimise sampling accuracy within cost, safety and accessibility constraints. To compare the sensitivity of different sampling collection sites and methods for the detection of current SARS-CoV-2 infection with any molecular or antigen-based test. Electronic searches of the Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register and the COVID-19 Living Evidence Database from the University of Bern (which includes daily updates from PubMed and Embase and preprints from medRxiv and bioRxiv) were undertaken on 22 February 2022. We included independent evaluations from national reference laboratories, FIND and the Diagnostics Global Health website. We did not apply language restrictions. We included studies of symptomatic or asymptomatic people with suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection undergoing testing. We included studies of any design that compared results from different sample types (anatomical location, operator, collection device) collected from the same participant within a 24-hour period. Within a sample pair, we defined a reference sample and an index sample collected from the same participant within the same clinical encounter (within 24 hours). Where the sample comparison was different anatomical sites, the reference standard was defined as a nasopharyngeal or combined naso/oropharyngeal sample collected into the same sample container and the index sample as the alternative anatomical site. Where the sample comparison was concerned with differences in the sample collection method from the same site, we defined the reference sample as that closest to standard practice for that sample type. Where the sample pair comparison was concerned with differences in personnel collecting the sample, the more skilled or experienced operator was considered the reference sample. Two review authors independently assessed the risk of bias and applicability concerns using the QUADAS-2 and QUADAS-C checklists, tailored to this review. We present estimates of the difference in the sensitivity (reference sample (%) minus index sample sensitivity (%)) in a pair and as an average across studies for each index sampling method using forest plots and tables. We examined heterogeneity between studies according to population (age, symptom status) and index sample (time post-symptom onset, operator expertise, use of transport medium) characteristics. This review includes 106 studies reporting 154 evaluations and 60,523 sample pair comparisons, of which 11,045 had SARS-CoV-2 infection. Ninety evaluations were of saliva samples, 37 nasal, seven oropharyngeal, six gargle, six oral and four combined nasal/oropharyngeal samples. Four evaluations were of the effect of operator expertise on the accuracy of three different sample types. The majority of included evaluations (146) used molecular tests, of which 140 used RT-PCR (reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction). Eight evaluations were of nasal samples used with Ag-RDTs (rapid antigen tests). The majority of studies were conducted in Europe (35/106, 33%) or the USA (27%) and conducted in dedicated COVID-19 testing clinics or in ambulatory hospital settings (53%). Targeted screening or contact tracing accounted for only 4% of evaluations. Where reported, the majority of evaluations were of adults (91/154, 59%), 28 (18%) were in mixed populations with only seven (4%) in children. The median prevalence of confirmed SARS-CoV-2 was 23% (interquartile (IQR) 13%-40%). Risk of bias and applicability assessment were hampered by poor reporting in 77% and 65% of included studies, respectively. Risk of bias was low across all domains in only 3% of evaluations due to inappropriate inclusion or exclusion criteria, unclear recruitment, lack of blinding, nonrandomised sampling order or differences in testing kit within a sample pair. Sixty-eight percent of evaluation cohorts were judged as being at high or unclear applicability concern either due to inflation of the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in study populations by selectively including individuals with confirmed PCR-positive samples or because there was insufficient detail to allow replication of sample collection. When used with RT-PCR • There was no evidence of a difference in sensitivity between gargle and nasopharyngeal samples (on average -1 percentage points, 95% CI -5 to +2, based on 6 evaluations, 2138 sample pairs, of which 389 had SARS-CoV-2). • There was no evidence of a difference in sensitivity between saliva collection from the deep throat and nasopharyngeal samples (on average +10 percentage points, 95% CI -1 to +21, based on 2192 sample pairs, of which 730 had SARS-CoV-2). • There was evidence that saliva collection using spitting, drooling or salivating was on average -12 percentage points less sensitive (95% CI -16 to -8, based on 27,253 sample pairs, of which 4636 had SARS-CoV-2) compared to nasopharyngeal samples. We did not find any evidence of a difference in the sensitivity of saliva collected using spitting, drooling or salivating (sensitivity difference: range from -13 percentage points (spit) to -21 percentage points (salivate)). • Nasal samples (anterior and mid-turbinate collection combined) were, on average, 12 percentage points less sensitive compared to nasopharyngeal samples (95% CI -17 to -7), based on 9291 sample pairs, of which 1485 had SARS-CoV-2. We did not find any evidence of a difference in sensitivity between nasal samples collected from the mid-turbinates (3942 sample pairs) or from the anterior nares (8272 sample pairs). • There was evidence that oropharyngeal samples were, on average, 17 percentage points less sensitive than nasopharyngeal samples (95% CI -29 to -5), based on seven evaluations, 2522 sample pairs, of which 511 had SARS-CoV-2. A much smaller volume of evidence was available for combined nasal/oropharyngeal samples and oral samples. Age, symptom status and use of transport media do not appear to affect the sensitivity of saliva samples and nasal samples. When used with Ag-RDTs • There was no evidence of a difference in sensitivity between nasal samples compared to nasopharyngeal samples (sensitivity, on average, 0 percentage points -0.2 to +0.2, based on 3688 sample pairs, of which 535 had SARS-CoV-2). When used with RT-PCR, there is no evidence for a difference in sensitivity of self-collected gargle or deep-throat saliva samples compared to nasopharyngeal samples collected by healthcare workers when used with RT-PCR. Use of these alternative, self-collected sample types has the potential to reduce cost and discomfort and improve the safety of sampling by reducing risk of transmission from aerosol spread which occurs as a result of coughing and gagging during the nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal sample collection procedure. This may, in turn, improve access to and uptake of testing. Other types of saliva, nasal, oral and oropharyngeal samples are, on average, less sensitive compared to healthcare worker-collected nasopharyngeal samples, and it is unlikely that sensitivities of this magnitude would be acceptable for confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 infection with RT-PCR. When used with Ag-RDTs, there is no evidence of a difference in sensitivity between nasal samples and healthcare worker-collected nasopharyngeal samples for detecting SARS-CoV-2. The implications of this for self-testing are unclear as evaluations did not report whether nasal samples were self-collected or collected by healthcare workers. Further research is needed in asymptomatic individuals, children and in Ag-RDTs, and to investigate the effect of operator expertise on accuracy. Quality assessment of the evidence base underpinning these conclusions was restricted by poor reporting. There is a need for further high-quality studies, adhering to reporting standards for test accuracy studies.",Emperador D; Van den Bruel A,Department of Public Health and Primary Care; FIND,

VH has been hypothesized to influence baseline vocal fold tension during phonation, and the relative fundamental frequency (RFF) during onset and offset cycles of phonation has been related to vocal fold tension and has been shown to differentiate typical voices from patients with VH in laboratory settings. In this study, we investigated whether the laboratory sensitivity of RFF to the presence of VH found in the laboratory is preserved in naturalistic, in-field settings and whether ecological momentary assessment of RFF during daily life could be a correlate of self-reported vocal effort. RFF analysis was carried out after performing smartphone-based monitoring of anterior neck-surface vibration with accelerometer sensors in both laboratory and in-field settings. Supervised machine learning was applied to combine multiple RFF values to discriminate and classify patients with VH from vocally typical speakers. Results showed that RFF-based classification of VH can be preserved in the naturalistic environments for patients with phonotraumatic (81.3% accuracy) and nonphonotraumatic (62.5% accuracy) VH. Additionally, we used explainability techniques to understand which RFF features were clinically relevant in the classification tasks. No direct relationship was observed between RFF and self-reported vocal effort. Overall, this study advances our understanding about RFF as a potential biomarker of VH as individuals go about their daily life. Machine learning algorithms can be implemented within a monitoring device for proactive screening or in biofeedback-based voice therapy paradigms.",,,ahsancheema@g.harvard.edu.

Most national registries rely on data collected as part of routine clinical encounters, an approach that does not capture real-world, patient-centred outcomes, such as physical activity, fatigue, ability to do daily tasks, and other indicators of quality of life. Digital health technologies that obtain such real-world data could greatly enhance patient registries but unresolved challenges have so far prevented their broad adoption. Based on our experience implementing digital health technologies in registries and observational studies, we propose potential solutions to three practical challenges we have repeatedly encountered: determining what to measure digitally, selecting the appropriate device, and ensuring representativeness and engagement over time. We describe the example of a hypothetical patient registry for valvular heart disease, a condition for which there is substantial variation in treatment selection and postintervention outcomes, and for which patient-centred outcome data are urgently needed to inform clinical care guidelines and health-service commissioning.",Marra C; Alexandrow A; Rainaldi E; Size K; Franklin JB; Grice H; Gariban A; Ellery J; Sudlow C; Abernethy AP; Morris A,Health Data Research; Verily Life Sciences; British Heart Foundation Data Science Centre-Patient and Public Group,cmarra@verily.com.

An online search was performed for articles published in PubMed and EMBASE between January 1, 1975, and January 7, 2023. Original studies reporting postoperative complications of sutureless intrascleral IOL fixation were included. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines were followed. The initial search yielded 1854 articles, from which 1797 were excluded; 57 and 51 were included in the qualitative synthesis and meta-analysis, respectively. Based on the meta-analysis, the postoperative complication rates of cystoid macular edema (5.7 %), retinal detachment (3.5 %), vitreous hemorrhage (8.8 %), and hypotony (5.5 %) were highest with the scleral tunnel technique. The glued technique had the highest complication rate for corneal edema (14.2 %). The rates of temporarily elevated intraocular pressure (9.9 %), iris capture (5.4 %), haptic exposure (6.5 %), and IOL decentration (7.3 %) were the highest with the flanged technique. The flanged technique had a significantly shorter operative time (median, 17.1 min) compared with the scleral tunnel (42.7 min) and glued (56.5 min) techniques. Postoperative best-corrected visual acuity with the flanged technique was significantly better than that with the other techniques (P = 0.017). This meta-analysis identified high postoperative complication rates related to the impact of surgical manipulations with the scleral tunnel technique and IOL placement stability with the flanged technique. These findings enable surgeons to minimize postoperative complications in high-risk patients.",,,tinoma@juntendo.ac.jp.

Upstream therapies targeting inflammatory or antifibrotic mechanisms have been disappointing in preventing AF progression, but more recently genetic and genomic studies in AF suggest novel cellular and metabolic stress targets, supporting prior studies of lifestyle and risk factor modification (LRFM) for AF. However, while obesity is a significant risk factor, weight loss and risk factor modification have not been successfully applied in a US population with AF. Metformin, a common drug that targets metabolic stress pathways, has demonstrated potential in reducing the burden of AF. The Targeting Risk Interventions and Metformin for Atrial Fibrillation (TRIM-AF, NCT03603912) is a randomized clinical trial designed to examine reduction of AF burden and progression, targeting metabolic upstream therapies. This single center trial, at the Cleveland Clinic, is designed as a prospective randomized open-label blinded endpoint (PROBE) 2 × 2 factorial study of metformin extended release up to 750 mg twice daily and lifestyle and risk factor modification (LRFM) in patients with a cardiovascular implantable electronic device (CIED) that have had at least one ≥ 5-min episode of atrial fibrillation (AF) over the prior 3 months. Randomization is stratified by pacemaker vs. ICD and rhythm at enrollment (sinus rhythm/atrial paced vs. AF). TRIM-AF trial aims to determine if metformin, lifestyle, and risk factor modification (LRFM) reduce AF burden and its progression and assess whether combined therapy outperforms individual treatments.

This study aims to analyse the degree of use of biological protection gloves as personal protective equipment (PPE), the factors that influence its use, and the profile of workers exposed to occupational biological agents in Spanish companies in the health sector, farms, meat industry, waste treatment plants, food industry and veterinary centers. We conducted a cross-sectional descriptive study involving 590 Spanish workers from 51 companies. We developed a 34-item questionnaire to assess workers' risk perception related to exposure to biological agents in their workplaces. Among the questions, three were designed to find the degree of use of key protective equipment in sectors with biological agent exposure: protective gloves, goggles or face shields, and respirators. We performed various statistical analyses, including Cronbach's alpha, frequency of endorsement, Content Validity Ratio (CVR) using Lawshe's method, Varimax rotation, Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin (KMO), and Bartlett's sphericity test, to assess the internal consistency and reliability of the questionnaire. Additionally, we employed a CHAID segmentation analysis, using workers' responses regarding their attitude toward glove usage as PPE for protection against biological risks, with demographic variables as independent factors. The CHAID analysis yielded a segmentation diagram, revealing five distinct groups or profiles of workers based on their use of protective gloves. Our study, through CHAID analysis, highlights that workers tend to use protective gloves more frequently when there is an internal Health and Safety department within the company.",Aguilar-Elena R; Agún-González JJ,Universidad Internacional de Valencia,

Patients were followed for 4-9 mos after fitting with an interview and Prosthetic Comfort and Utility questionnaire. Out of 18 participants, 13 were located and provided follow-up feedback. Seven of the original 13 were still wearing the adjustable socket, while three reverted to their old socket and three did not use any socket. The highest positive rated question was the ability of the socket to accommodate changes in volume. Twelve (92%) of the participants said that they would recommend the system, yet cited that bulk and lack of cosmetic cover as major issues. For participants who had a conventional prosthesis, it took over a year to get their device through prosthetists using conventional fabrication techniques. This socket system seems to be a feasible option for persons with lower limb loss in Botswana.

However, over the last 2 decades, minimally invasive surgical approaches (multiport thoracoscopic and robotic-assisted surgery) have proven feasible, offering similar survival, lower morbidity, and shorter length of stay. Single-port (SP) subxiphoid thymectomy potentially offers less pain and allows bilateral visualization of the mediastinum. A prospective, multicenter, single-arm clinical study was conducted to evaluate the performance and safety of the da Vinci SP surgical system (Intuitive) for thymectomy through a subxiphoid incision. Primary performance end points included ability to achieve R0 resection and completion of the procedure without conversion. The primary safety end point was all adverse events up to 30 days postoperatively. The study enrolled 13 individuals (benign, n = 6; malignant, n = 7) at 6 centers in the United States. All SP thymectomy procedures were completed through a small (mean, 3.8 cm) subxiphoid incision without conversion to other minimally invasive or open approaches. For malignant cases, the rate of complete resection was 100%. No study participants experienced any intraoperative or serious adverse events. No unanticipated adverse device effects were reported. Thymectomy using the da Vinci SP surgical system through a subxiphoid approach is feasible, and there are no early indications of safety or procedural concerns. Larger clinical studies are warranted to further evaluate the relative benefits and limitations of the SP system compared with multiport robotic thymectomy.",Zervos M,Department of Cardiothoracic Surgery,drice@mdanderson.org.

The objective of this study was to validate continuous respiratory rate measurements from a radar-based contactless patient monitor [Vitalthings Guardian M10 (Vitalthings AS, Norway)] in a hospital ward. An observational study (clinicaltrials.gov: NCT06083272) was conducted at the emergency ward of a university hospital.

The agreement was assessed using Bland-Altman 95% limits of agreement. The sensitivity and specificity of clinical alarms were evaluated using a Clarke Error grid modified for continuous monitoring of respiratory rate. Clinical aspects were further evaluated in terms of trend analysis and examination of gaps between valid measurements. 32 patients were monitored for a median duration of 42 min [IQR (range) 35-46 (30-59 min)].

Modern structured light 3D scanning can generate high-quality 3D representations of surface anatomy using a mobile device. We hypothesized that a mobile-based 3D scanning system would provide accurate deformity assessments compared to a scoliometer. Between August 2020 and June 2022, patients 10-18 years being evaluated for AIS in our clinic with a scoliosis radiograph obtained within 30 days of clinic evaluation and no history of spinal surgery were enrolled. Patients had 3D scans taken in the upright and forward bend positions, and the largest angle of trunk rotation (ATR) was measured by a scoliometer. Image processing software was used to analyze trunk shift (TS), coronal balance (CB), and clavicle angle (CL) in the upright position and the largest ATR in the forward bend position. 3D and scoliometer measurements were correlated to major curve magnitude. Multiple logistic regression models were created based on 3D and scoliometer measurements, controlling for demographic covariates. Two hundred and fifty-eight patients were included in this study. Mean coronal major curve magnitude was 25.7° (range 0-100), and 59% had a thoracic major curve. There were good-to-excellent correlations between 3D and radiographic measures of TS, CB, and CL (r = 0.79, rs = 0.80, and r = 0.64, respectively, p < 0.001). Correlations between 3D and radiographic measures of largest lumbar and thoracic ATR also demonstrated good correlations (r = 0.64 for both, p < 0.001). Using Akaike's Information Criterion (AIC), a multivariable logistic regression model based on 3D scanning outperformed a scoliometer model. Mobile device-based 3D scanning of TS, CB, and TS identifies clinically relevant scoliotic deformity and is more predictive of radiographic curve magnitude than scoliometer in this population. This new modality may facilitate scoliosis screening by decreasing the need for trained personnel or dedicated equipment and clinical space to perform screening tests.

However, the advanced age of the patients, together with the difficulties in achieving the required cell amounts, impede autologous treatments. Reprogramming of MSCs into induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), followed by re-differentiation to MSCs has emerged as a promising and safe method to facilitate the cell expansion and the removal of aging-associated characteristics. However, the effect of reprogramming on the MSC's pro-angiogenicity is poorly understood. In this study, we use a microfluidic organ-on-a-chip platform designed for vascularization assays to study and compare the effects of bone marrow MSCs (BM-MSCs) and iPSC-derived MSCs (iMSCs) in stimulating the formation of vessels by endothelial cells. Cells were loaded in fibrin hydrogels, injected into the microfluidic channel, and grown for ten days. Fluorescence microscopy revealed that BM-MSCs promote the formation of long and interconnected endothelial vessels, while iMSCs barely stimulate neoangiogenesis. This was further confirmed and explained by bulk RNA sequencing, showing a decrease of pro-angiogenic agents in both of the iMSCs co-cultures. Furthermore, transmission electron microscopy revealed that BM-MSCs closely associate with the new vessels as perivascular cells, while iMSCs just remain in proximity. These results highlight iMSCs as a promising substitute for BM-MSCs in the treatment of diseases with pernicious vascularization, such as osteoarthritis, ocular degeneration, and cancer.",,,thiebes@ame.rwth-aachen.de.

Automated relative afferent pupillary defect (RAPD) and pupillary light reflex (PLR) testing may offer more objective alternatives. This pilot study aimed to evaluate whether RAPD could sufficiently distinguish between the two eyes in asymmetrical glaucoma, and thus could lay the foundation for using the PLR of a single eye to monitor progression longitudinally. Twenty-one patients underwent quantitative PLR measurements using a virtual reality headset. RAPD was calculated by subtracting the amplitude of PLRs between eyes. Both RAPD and relative SAP (measured using the mean defect or MD) results were correlated to the thickness of the peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL), as measured by OCT. Data from 18 patients was analyzed after exclusions. RAPD significantly correlated with differences between the two eyes as measured by RNFL thickness (Pearson r = 0.79, p = 0.05). MD differences correlated slightly better with RNFL differences (Pearson r = 0.87, p < 0.05). RAPD and MD combined yielded an improved prediction of RNFL differences by 5% compared to using MD only. RAPD measurements reliably detected asymmetries in optic nerve damage in glaucoma patients. SAP measurements correlated better with OCT results than RAPD results. However, SAP and RAPD combined led to an improved prediction of RNFL thickness. This could possibly allow us to use PLR only over longer periods of time to monitor glaucomatous optic nerve damage in a single eye in the future. Aktuelle Standardmethoden zur Überwachung der Glaukomprogression wie die optische Kohärenztomografie (OCT) und die standardisierte automatisierte Perimetrie (SAP) haben in bestimmten Fällen Einschränkungen. Automatisierte Tests des relativen afferenten Pupillendefekts (RAPD) und des pupillären Lichtreflexes (PLR) könnten objektivere Alternativen bieten. Diese Pilotstudie zielte darauf ab zu evaluieren, ob der RAPD bei asymmetrischem Glaukom ausreichend zwischen beiden Augen differenzieren kann, um so die Grundlage für die Verwendung des PLR eines einzelnen Auges zur längerfristigen Überwachung der Glaukomprogression zu schaffen. 21 Patienten unterzogen sich quantitativen PLR-Messungen mithilfe eines Virtual-Reality-Headsets. Der RAPD wurde berechnet, indem die Amplitude der PLRs zwischen den Augen subtrahiert wurde. Sowohl der RAPD, als auch die relativen SAP-Ergebnisse (gemessen mit dem mittleren Defekt oder MD) wurden mit der peripapillären retinalen Nervenfaserschichtdicke (RNFL) korreliert, die mittels OCT ermittelt wurde. Nach Ausschlüssen wurden die Daten von 18 Patienten analysiert. Der RAPD korrelierte signifikant mit den Unterschieden der RNFL-Dicke zwischen beiden Augen (Pearson r = 0,79, p = 0,05). MD-Unterschiede korrelierten etwas besser mit den RNFL-Unterschieden (Pearson r = 0,87, p < 0,05).

This assessment used a mixed-methods approach that included 1:1 interviews with in-country subject matter experts (SMEs) and an electronic survey capturing qualitative and quantitative data from practicing in-country physicians. Our analysis reflects countries with CME/CPD systems that are quite mature when compared to other areas of the world. Almost all the European countries have CME/CPD systems that are professionally self-regulated and have implemented policies or laws to limit the influence of pharmaceutical or device companies over content in CME/CPD. Several countries have incorporated a learning sciences framework into their systems, including self-assessment/self-reflection and evaluation of professional practice gaps. Overall quality of CME/CPD systems was described as high, with education focused on knowledge and practice change. Opportunities for improvement are focused on increasing innovation, improving transparency and consistency, and decreasing administrative burdens. About half the countries have and support IPCE, which is likely also a marker of a more mature CME/CPD system. This mixed-method assessment demonstrates that the CME/CPD systems in the 15 European countries reflect elements of mature systems globally. Physician participation is mandated or strongly encouraged and supported. Physicians have access to a wide variety of opportunities to participate in CME/CPD, and they do participate even if not required by regulation. There are mechanisms to ensure the quality of CME/CPD even when pharmaceutical or device companies are permitted to provide education.

The radial nerve was electrically stimulated in the right wrist, and the evoked magnetic field was recorded using a 132-channel bio-magnetometer system with a superconducting quantum interference device positioned below the upper arm. The measurements were divided into distal and proximal sessions because of the extensive range of the nerve. MNG recorded the radial nerve's evoked magnetic field in all cases, and the neural activity of the radial nerve at the upper arm was visualized using reconstructed currents. The mean conduction velocity calculated from the peak latency of the inward currents was 43.9 m/s for distal measurements and 57.9 m/s for proximal measurements. A 67-year-old female patient with radial nerve palsy had a disappearance of the reconstructed inward current and conduction disturbance of the axonal current, facilitating the identification of the lesion site. MNG allowed visualization of the radial nerve activity in the upper arm and facilitated the identification of the lesion site in a patient with radial nerve palsy. This method could be a useful diagnostic tool for patients with radial nerve palsy.",Sato S; Yamamoto Y,RICOH Futures BU,

Studies in mice and humans have revealed associations between the early-life gut microbiome and future susceptibility to immune and metabolic diseases. To resolve microbe and host contributing factors to early-life development and to disease states requires experimental platforms that support reproducible, longitudinal, and high-content analyses. Here, we deployed a continuous single-stage chemostat culture model of the human distal gut to study gut microbiota from 18- to 24-month-old children integrating both culture-dependent and -independent methods. Chemostat cultures recapitulated multiple aspects of the fecal microbial ecosystem enabling investigation of relationships between bacterial strains and metabolic function, as well as a resource from which we isolated and curated a diverse library of early life bacterial strains. We report the reproducible, longitudinal dynamics of early-life bacterial communities cultured in an advanced model of the human gut providing an experimental approach and a characterized bacterial resource to support future investigations of the human gut microbiota in early childhood.",,,jayne.danska@sickkids.ca.

In previous studies in patients with moderate-to-severe AD, lebrikizumab, administered subcutaneously via a prefilled syringe with a needle safety device (PFS-NSD), demonstrated rapid and durable dose-dependent efficacy. We assessed the pharmacokinetics and safety of lebrikizumab using either a PFS-NSD or an investigational autoinjector. Such devices have been developed to make self-injection easier for patients, thus increasing adherence over long treatment durations. The current study compared the pharmacokinetics and safety of 250 mg lebrikizumab (2 mL of a 125-mg/mL solution) administered subcutaneously at 1 of 3 different injection sites (abdomen, arm, or thigh) in 241 healthy participants using either a PFS-NSD (N = 122) or an investigational autoinjector (N = 119).

While effective, variability in outcomes necessitates identifying predictors of therapeutic response. This study examined whether motor threshold (MT), percentage of motor threshold (%MT), and treatment intensity could predict clinical outcomes in MDD patients undergoing rTMS and iTBS. Adult MDD patients treated with NeuroStar rTMS or iTBS at Mayo Clinic from February 2016 to April 2024 were included. MT, %MT, and treatment intensity were recorded. Clinical outcomes were assessed via Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) score changes, response (PHQ-9 change ≥50 %), remission (PHQ-9 < 5), and a patient-reported outcome (PRO) on treatment helpfulness. Linear and logistic regression models were used to assess predictors of clinical outcomes. Among 149 patients analyzed (mean age 45.7, 67.8 % female), response rate was 43.0 % and remission rate was 16.8 %. MT and %MT did not significantly correlate with clinical outcomes. Treatment intensity and TMS type did not predict PHQ-9 score changes. Higher treatment intensity was associated with decreased odds of positive PRO responses. Linear regression showed that age and gender significantly predicted PHQ-9 score changes, with older patients and females showing greater improvement. MT was significantly lower in men and with iTBS compared to rTMS. MT, %MT, and treatment intensity did not reliably predict outcomes. Higher intensity was linked to reduced patient-reported helpfulness, suggesting that patient comfort is crucial. iTBS's lower MT may benefit those needing less stimulation. Future research should identify better predictors to improve TMS outcomes.",Kung S; Penaluna BK; Greenwaldt SE; Croarkin PE; Lapid MI,Mayo Clinic,kung.simon@mayo.edu.

Several studies have evaluated the distribution of payment value and types to orthopaedic surgeons, but little is known about the spending patterns from an industry-centric perspective. The purpose of this study was to describe the payment patterns of top medical device companies in orthopaedics while presenting a geospatial analysis of these trends. The Open Payments database was assessed for all records of industry financial relationships with orthopaedic surgeons from 2015 to 2021. Value of financial relationships was expressed on a per orthopaedic surgeon basis, with the numerator representing total value of payments and denominator representing number of orthopaedic surgeons, and was geographically analyzed according to United States Census Divisions. Based on averages during the study period, the top 10 paying companies were (1) DePuy, (2) Zimmer Biomet, (3) Stryker Corporation, (4) Arthrex, (5) SpineFrontier, (6) Medtronic, (7) Smith and Nephew, (8) Renovis Surgical Technologies, (9) NuVasive, and (10) Paragon 28. Payments in the South Atlantic ($6,854 ± $1,265) Division were significantly greater than all other eight divisions ( P < 0.001), with the next leading division being the Pacific Division ($4,114 ± $643). Five companies strongly favored one particular division, directing more than double the amount of payments to this division compared with the next leading division (SpineFrontier, 99% South Atlantic; Renovis Surgical Technologies, 81% Pacific; Paragon 28, 59% South Atlantic; NuVasive, 43% West North Central; DePuy, 35% South Atlantic). Only 3 of 10 companies were headquartered in the same division where most payments were made. From 2015 to 2021, companies preferentially supported surgeons in certain geographic regions, irrespective of where they were headquartered in.

We investigated the feasibility of using super-resolution ultrasound (SR-US) imaging for visualizing and quantifying the microvasculature of intraparenchymal FLLs. Patients with FLLs between June 2022 and February 2023 were prospectively screened. Following bolus injection of microbubbles at clinical concentration, SR-US was performed using a high frame rate (350-500 Hz) modified ultrasound scanner and a convex array transducer with a central frequency of 3.1 MHz. In total, 47 pathologically proven FLLs at a depth of 5.7 ± 1.7 cm (mean ± standard deviation) were included: 30 hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC), 11 liver metastases (LM), and 6 focal nodular hyperplasias (FNH). The smallest detectable vessel size of the hepatic microvasculature was 128.4 ± 18.6 μm (mean ± standard deviation) at a depth of 8 cm. Significant differences were observed among the three types of lesions in terms of pattern categories, vessel density, minimum flow velocity, and perfusion index. We observed higher vessel density for FNH versus liver parenchyma (p < 0.001) as well as fractal dimension and local flow direction entropy value for FNH versus HCC (p = 0.002 and p < 0.001, respectively) and for FNH versus LM (p = 0.006 and p = 0.002, respectively). Multiparametric SR-US showed that these three pathological types of FLLs have specific microvascular phenotypes. Vessel density, fractal dimension and local flow direction entropy served as valuable parameters in distinguishing between benign and malignant FLLs. ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT06018142). Multiparametric SR-US imaging offers precise morphological and functional assessment of the microvasculature of intraparenchymal focal liver lesions, providing insights into tumor heterogeneity and angiogenesis. Super-resolution (SR)-US imaging allowed morphological and functional evaluation of intraparenchymal hepatic lesion microvasculature.

However, ureteral stents themselves cause pain and urinary symptoms in many patients that can lead to morbidity. Professional society guidelines support stent omission after uncomplicated ureteroscopy, which represents most cases. Despite this, ureteral stents are utilized in more than 80% of all ureteroscopy procedures. One reason for guideline discordance is the low level of evidence supporting stent omission recommendations. Studies are inconclusive on whether stents increase pain and complications. A recent Cochrane review concluded higher quality and large trials are needed to inform decision-making. Furthermore, there is a lack of studies evaluating health-related quality of life (HRQOL), patient-reported outcomes (PROs), and unplanned healthcare utilization. Another factor is that prospective clinical trials are hindered by patient reluctance to be randomized to either stent placement or omission. The outcomes of patients who decline randomization have been ignored in trials, limiting the generalizability of the evidence. Through collaboration with patient partners, we developed a pragmatic multi-center combined randomized and observational cohort study in a quality improvement collaborative. Patients will be prospectively enrolled into a randomized cohort in which assignment to ureteral stent omission (vs. placement) is determined in the operating room using a web-based randomization platform. Patients who decline randomization are invited to take part in an observational (real-world) cohort in which the determination of stent use is at the discretion of the urologist. Patients in both cohorts will complete preoperative and postoperative assessments of PROs including pain, urinary symptoms, interference with usual activities, time taken off work or school, and treatment satisfaction. Unplanned healthcare utilization within 30 days postoperatively will be assessed by review of the electronic health record. Severe adverse events will be recorded. A subgroup of patients and urologists will also participate in qualitative semi-structured interviews focusing on knowledge, preferences, and practice patterns regarding ureteral stenting. Interview transcripts will be thematically analyzed. This study is designed to evaluate the HRQOL and 30-day healthcare utilization of patients undergoing ureteral stent omission compared to stent placement following uncomplicated ureteroscopic treatment of upper urinary tract stones. Additionally, patient and urologist opinions and preferences related to ureteral stenting will be explored through qualitative interviews, with the aim of identifying key barriers and facilitators of practice change related to stenting practices.

To investigate the incidence, characteristics, and clinical implications of angiographically detected residual trabeculation after LAAC using the WATCHMAN device. We analyzed 1350 consecutive patients with atrial fibrillation undergoing LAAC using the WATCHMAN device from the OCEAN-LAAC registry, which is a prospective ongoing, multicenter Japanese registry. The inclusion criteria comprised patients who successfully underwent LAAC and whose presence or absence of residual trabeculation can be confirmed using a contrast medium. The clinical outcomes were compared between patients with and without angiographically detected residual trabeculation. Residual trabeculation was angiographically detected in 5.6% (75/1350 patients). At the procedure, the proportion of peri-device leak (PDL) was significantly higher in the residual trabeculation group than in the non-residual trabeculation group (20% vs. 5.1%, p < 0.001). However, the PDL and device-related thrombosis at 45 days and 1 year were comparable between the two groups (37% vs. 23%, p = 0.24; 28% vs. 31%, p = 0.84; 2.1% vs. 1.4%, p = 0.50; 6.9% vs. 6.0%, p = 0.69, respectively).

The purpose of this study was to investigate whether attaching microneedles to acupoints would improve PD pathology by recovering immune dysfunction. The PD mouse model was induced by intrastriatal injection of 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA), and microneedle patches (MPs) or sham patches (SPs) were attached to GB20 and GB34, representative acupoints for treating PD for 14 days. First, the behavioral experiment showed that motor disorders induced by 6-OHDA were significantly improved by MP. Simultaneously, 6-OHDA-induced dopaminergic neuronal death and brain neuroinflammation decreased. Conversely, SP had no effect on behavioral disorders, neuronal death, or neuroinflammation. Measurement results from flow cytometry of immune cells in the brain and blood revealed a disruption in the CD4+/CD8+ ratio in the 6-OHDA group, which was significantly restored in the MP group. The brain mRNA expression of cytokines was significantly increased in the 6-OHDA group, which was significantly decreased by MP.

39627541,A multiwell plate approach to increase the sample throughput during tissue clearing.,2025-04-08,Nature protocols,10.1038/s41596-024-01080-1,"Tissue clearing, coupled with immunostaining, enables the transition from two-dimensional to three-dimensional pathology and has the potential to substantially improve data quality for biomedical diagnostics. Nevertheless, the workflows are limited by the complex sample processing protocols. Approaches for the parallel processing of samples, to include tissue clearing, immunostaining, imaging and analysis can increase three-dimensional pathology throughput. Here we detail a step-by-step approach that combines a tissue clearing device with a six-well multiwell plate to increase the throughput compared with methods using conventional clearing protocols. The six-well multiplate allows for parallel tissue clearing of multiple samples and is compatible with passive tissue clearing methods including Clear, Unobstructed Brain/Body Imaging Cocktails and Computational (CUBIC) analysis. In addition, gel embedding is performed without moving the samples from the wells, and a series of steps such as imaging with a high-speed light-sheet microscope and analysis in the cloud can be performed. Although this procedure slightly extends the overall time required for preparing and analyzing a single sample, it reduces the effort required at each step, such as reagent exchange and gel embedding, which results in an overall reduction in hands-on time due to the parallel sample processing. We describe a series of whole-organ analyses, including high-throughput tissue clearing, staining, gel embedding, imaging and data analysis in the cloud, as a useful platform for cellular biology and pathology. The total process varies depending on the presence or absence of immunostaining, but for some six-well plates, the tissue clearing process, imaging and data analysis can be completed within 10 d.",,,uedah-tky@umin.ac.jp.

We retrospectively collected wrist radiographs from 1748 patients who had imaging before and after splint application at a single institution. The dataset was divided into training (1696 patients, 5353 images) and testing sets (52 patients, 965 images). A CycleGAN-based model was trained to generate splint-free wrist radiographs (generated ""splint-less"") from the original ""splint"" images. A pre-trained fracture detection model (YOLO8s) was used to assess fracture detection performance on three image groups: original ""splint-less"" radiographs, original ""splint"" radiographs, and generated ""splint-less"" radiographs. Two radiologists scored the generated images. Subtraction images quantified overall image alterations. Precision, recall, and F1 scores were used to compare fracture detection performance. CycleGAN effectively generated splint-suppressed radiographs with minimal remaining splint density (< 10% remaining in 97.99%), hardware distortion (< 10% change in 100%), anatomical distortion (< 10% in 99.63%), and fracture lesion changes (< 10% change in 100%). New artefacts were rare (absent in 97.54%). Notably, the fracture detection model achieved higher precision (0.94 vs. 0.92), recall (0.63 vs. 0.5), and F1 score (0.75 vs. 0.65) on the generated ""splint-less"" radiographs compared to the original ""splint"" radiographs, approaching the performance on original ""splint-less"" radiographs (F1 0.71). Furthermore, greater image alterations by CycleGAN correlated with larger improvements in fracture detection. CycleGAN successfully removed splint densities from wrist radiographs with splints. Question Can CycleGAN (Generative Adversarial Networks), designed for image-to-image translation, generate synthetic ""splint-less"" radiographs to improve fracture visualisation in follow-up radiographs? Findings Removal of splint densities from wrist radiographs using Generative Adversarial Networks preserved anatomical structures and improved the performance of a fracture detection model. Clinical relevance Generated splint-less radiographs can enhance the performance of wrist fracture detection in wrist radiographs, benefiting both human clinicians and AI-powered diagnostic tools.",,,jy.jung@songeui.ac.kr.

Multicentre randomised controlled trial. Surgical services of 55 hospitals worldwide. 2498 adults aged ≥65 years with an American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status classification of II or greater and undergoing major elective gastrointestinal surgery, recruited between January 2017 and September 2022. Participants were assigned to minimally invasive cardiac output-guided intravenous fluid therapy with low dose inotrope infusion during and four hours after surgery, or to usual care without cardiac output monitoring. The primary outcome was postoperative infection within 30 days of randomisation. Safety outcomes were acute cardiac events within 24 hours and 30 days. Secondary outcomes were acute kidney injury within 30 days and mortality within 180 days. In 2498 patients (mean age 74 (standard deviation 6) years, 57% women), the primary outcome occurred in 289/1247 (23.2%) intervention patients and 283/1247 (22.7%) usual care patients (adjusted odds ratio 1.03 (95% confidence interval 0.84 to 1.25); P=0.81). Acute cardiac events within 24 hours occurred in 38/1250 (3.0%) intervention patients and 21/1247 (1.7%) usual care patients (adjusted odds ratio 1.82 (1.06 to 3.13); P=0.03). This difference was primarily due to an increased incidence of arrhythmias among intervention patients. Acute cardiac events within 30 days occurred in 85/1249 (6.8%) intervention patients and 79/1247 (6.3%) usual care patients (adjusted odds ratio 1.06 (0.77 to 1.47); P=0.71). Other secondary outcomes did not differ. This clinical effectiveness trial in patients undergoing major elective gastrointestinal surgery did not provide evidence that cardiac output-guided intravenous fluid therapy with low dose inotrope infusion could reduce the incidence of postoperative infections. The intervention was associated with an increased incidence of acute cardiac events within 24 hours, in particular tachyarrhythmias. Based on these findings, the routine use of this treatment approach in unselected patients is not recommended. ISRCTN Registry ISRCTN39653756.",,,

Biohybrid sensors based on ORs described to date show selectivity towards specific versus non-specific binding of odorants, being unable to distinguish between specific ligands of different affinity. Here we disclose a method that enables odorant discrimination based on the modulation of the capacitive response of the receptor, which allows the differentiation of three high-affinity hOR1A1 agonists. We performed voltammetry and impedance measurements of the hOR1A1 receptor selectively immobilized on a gold electrode in the absence and presence of the agonists. Binding induces a decrease in the capacitive response of the receptor that is proportional to the ligand potency, reaching up to a 40% decrease for the cognate ligand dihydrojasmone, which is attributed to changes in the magnitude and orientation of the electric dipole in the receptor, thereby regulating its response to the applied electric field.",Belloir C; Lalis M; Briand L; Topin J,Institut de Chimie de Nice; Centre des Sciences Du Goût et de L'Alimentation,alagunas@ibecbarcelona.eu.

The objectives were to assess the quality of kinematic traces from three head impact sensors, determine the effects of signal quality on peak accelerations, and compare measurements across sensors. Head impacts were collected with instrumented mouthguards, skin patches, and headgear patches during boxing sparring. The quality of the raw kinematic traces for 442 events for each sensor was categorized using pre-defined objective criteria into high, questionable, and low-quality classes. The proportion of high-quality recordings was analyzed by participant, type of impact, and impact location. Associations between signal quality and peak kinematics were assessed within each sensor, and peak kinematics (resolved to the head center of gravity) were compared between sensors. High-quality criteria were met in 53%, 20%, and 26% of events for the mouthguard, skin patch, and headgear patch, respectively. High-quality recordings were less frequent for impacts occurring close to the sensor (e.g., 30% vs. 61% for the mouthguard) and showed lower peak kinematics than low-quality recordings (p < 0.001). Despite careful selection of high-quality simultaneous recordings, there was little to no association between the sensors' measurements (Spearman's p ≥ 0.043). The kinematic data often reflected the motion of the sensor itself rather than the motion of the head, overestimating head impact magnitude. Researchers should evaluate data quality prior to analyzing kinematics or injury severity metrics. Comparison of data across studies or in relation to injury risk functions needs to be done with caution when data were acquired from different sensors.",Siegmund GP,MEA Forensic Engineers & Scientists,enora.leflao@osumc.edu.

To address this need, microneedle (MN) patches containing needlelike projections made from a polymer/drug matrix can be painlessly pressed into the skin for local or systemic drug delivery. To improve the speed and ease of drug delivery, we present a rapidly dissolving, highly water-soluble MN patch, which minimizes the wear time to 10 s to improve drug delivery in situations where rapid delivery with simplified administration is needed. MNs were made of polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP), which is soluble in both water (enabling dissolution in the skin) and polar organic solvents (facilitating coformulation with lidocaine (L)). The addition of a highly water-soluble salt, sodium bicarbonate (NaB), to PVP/L MNs allowed for 60% faster MN dissolution in porcine skin ex vivo. Further addition of citric acid to generate effervescence upon reaction with NaB did not further decrease the MN dissolution time in the pig skin and led to poor shelf-life stability due to premature effervescence during storage. The PVP/L/NaB MNs delivered 23.8 ± 3.5 μg lidocaine to the skin ex vivo, well above the expected dose for local analgesic effect. Our highly water-soluble PVP/L/NaB MN design enables shorter wear time for faster delivery compared to the oral or topical route and easier administration compared to injection currently used for the delivery of drugs needing a rapid onset of action.",,,

Assistive technology (AT) supports individuals with communication, but the acceptability of AT solutions is highly variable. In this paper a novel ear based control method of AT, the concept of 'EarSwitch', is presented. This new approach is based on detecting ear rumbling, which is the voluntary contraction of the tensor tympani muscle (TTM), resulting in observable movement of the eardrum and a dull rumbling sound. 'EarSwitch' has the potential to be a discreet method that can complement existing AT control methods. However, only a subset of the population can ear rumble and little is known about the ability of rumbling in populations with neurological disorders. To explore the viability of the 'EarSwitch' concept as an AT control method we conducted in-depth online surveys with (N=1853) respondents from the general population and (N=170) respondents with self-declared neurological disorders including Motor Neurone Disease (MND) and Multiple Sclerosis (MS).This is the largest ever study to explore ear rumbling and the first to explore whether rumbling is preserved among individuals with neurological disorders. In addition, we validated rumbling, and investigated usability of the 'EarSwitch' concept as a control input, using in-person otoscopic examination with a subset of participants. A significant proportion of the population with neurological disorders could benefit from 'EarSwitch' controllable AT. The upper bound prevalence of the ability to rumble without accompanying movements was 55% in the general population, 38% in the neurological population, and 20% of participants with MND (N=95) reported this ability. During the validation procedure, participants achieved high accuracy in self-reporting the ability to rumble (80%) and proved concept of using the 'EarSwitch' method to control a basic interface. 'EarSwitch' is a potential new AT control method control, either by itself or as a supplement to other existing methods. Results demonstrate self-reported ear rumbling is present among patients with different neurological disorders, including MND. Further research should explore how well the ability to rumble is preserved in different types and stages of neurological disorders.",Gompertz N,EarSwitch Ltd.,b.w.metcalfe@bath.ac.uk.

As such, collagens are widely used biomaterials in tissue engineering; however, most 3D fabrication methods use only collagen type I and are restricted to simple cast or molded geometries that are not representative of native tissue. Freeform reversible embedding of suspended hydrogel (FRESH) 3D bioprinting has emerged as a method to fabricate complex 3D scaffolds from collagen I but has yet to be leveraged for other collagen isoforms. Here, we developed collagen type II, collagen type III, and combination bioinks for FRESH 3D bioprinting of millimeter-sized scaffolds with micrometer scale features with fidelity comparable to scaffolds fabricated with the established collagen I bioink. At the microscale, single filament extrusions were similar across all collagen bioinks with a nominal diameter of ∼100 μm using a 34-gauge needle. Scaffolds as large as 10 × 10 × 2 mm were also fabricated and showed similar overall resolution and fidelity across collagen bioinks. Finally, cell adhesion and growth on the different collagen bioinks as either cast or FRESH 3D bioprinted scaffolds were compared and found to support similar growth behaviors. In total, our results expand the range of collagen isoform bioinks that can be 3D bioprinted and demonstrate that collagen types I, II, III, and combinations thereof can all be FRESH printed with high fidelity and comparable biological response. This serves to expand the toolkit for the fabrication of tailored collagen scaffolds that can better recapitulate the extracellular matrix properties of specific tissue types.",,,

A known CRT risk factor is a high catheter-to-vein ratio (CVR), or a large catheter diameter with respect to the indwelling vein size. In this study, the CVR's effect on CVC hemodynamics and its impact on CRT is investigated with in vitro and in silico experiments. An in vitro flow loop is used to characterize the hemodynamics around CVCs using particle image velocimetry. In addition, CRT is investigated using an in vitro flow loop with human blood and clinical catheters. The wall shear rate of flow around the CVC is computed numerically. CVRs of 0.20, 0.33, and 0.49 and Reynolds numbers of 200, 800, and 1300 are evaluated. No flow is used through CVC lumens to model chronic indwelling catheters. Results show CVR ≥ 0.33 promotes platelet-rich clot growth at the device tip and at an increased rate compared to lower CVR cases. A high wall shear rate gradient on the CVC tip and an extended wake distal to the tip exists for higher CVR cases, promoting the aggregation of platelets and subsequent stagnation for clot formation. Further, the combination of the CVR and Reynolds number are crucial to CRT potential, not the CVR alone. Specifically, thrombosis risk is increased with low (stasis driven) and/or high (platelet activation driven) flow conditions, with the CVR and CVC's geometry playing an additional role in promoting fluid mechanic driven thrombus development. A high CVR (≥ 0.33) and high flow condition (≥ 1300) results in the highest risk for clot growth at the tip of the device; other locations of the device are at risk for thrombus development in lower flow conditions, regardless of the CVR. The importance of the device geometry and flow in promoting thrombus and fibrin sheath formation is also shown for the device investigated. This work demonstrates that the CVR, flow, and device geometry affect CRT. For clinical cases with CVR ≥ 0.33 and/or Re ≥ 1300, the device tip may be monitored more consistently for clot formation. Thrombosis risks remain on the entire catheter, regardless of the flow condition, for a CVR = 0.49. Device placement should be chosen carefully with respect to the combination of the Reynolds number and CVR. Further study is needed on the effect of catheterization to confirm these findings.",,,kbm10@psu.edu.

Despite the effectiveness of these available treatments, many patients' symptoms do not remit. This has led to the search for novel treatments for PTSD. In this review, the authors critically evaluate the data supporting several emerging pharmacological and other somatic interventions in the categories of medication-assisted psychotherapy, novel medication monotherapy strategies, and neuromodulation, selected because of the salience of their mechanisms of action to the pathophysiology of PTSD (e.g., MDMA-assisted psychotherapy, ketamine, cannabidiol, transcranial magnetic stimulation). The authors also evaluate the evidence for treatments that are the focus of increasing scientific or public interest (i.e., hyperbaric oxygen therapy, stellate ganglion block, neurofeedback). To date, the evidence supporting most novel pharmacological and somatic treatments for PTSD is preliminary and highly variable; however, the data for several specific treatments, such as transcranial magnetic stimulation, are encouraging.",,,

A sensitivity of 94.3% and a specificity of 99.9% were achieved. Finally, enumeration was performed on CTCs obtained from pancreatic cancer patients. We further demonstrated the DCLC's ability in zero-shot generalization of enumeration on lung cancer patients' CTCs.

Data analysis was conducted in Rstudio (version 2022.07.0) with Kruskal-Wallis, Mann-Whitney U, and Chi-square tests to assess statistical significance across specialties, regions, and payment periods. Between 2017 and 2023, 2,158,140 payments totaling $601,567,196.10 were made to 19,585 U.S.-based hematology, medical oncology, and hematology-oncology specialists. Hematology-oncology received the highest total payment amount ($393,169,915.10) and transaction count (1,700,202), while hematology had the highest median payment ($23.05) compared to hematology-oncology ($18.12) and medical oncology ($19.5). Payment patterns demonstrated seasonal peaks, particularly in Q1 and Q4, and increased markedly during major oncology conferences (ASCO, ASH). Analysis by geographic region revealed that the South consistently received the highest total payments, peaking at $36.8 million in 2023, while the Northeast had the highest median payment values, reaching $22.87 in 2023. The COVID-19 pandemic corresponded with lasting shifts in payment patterns, with median payment values rising significantly during the pandemic period and remaining elevated post-COVID across all specialties. Additionally, the distribution of payments by type revealed that direct cash payments and consulting fees were the most prominent, with hematology-oncology showing the greatest reliance on high-value cash transactions, while stock payments featured prominently in hematology. Sensitivity analyses confirmed these patterns as robust, with minimal variance observed when excluding extreme values, further validating consistent trends across specialties, regions, and periods. This study reveals specialty- and region-specific variations in oncology-related payments, with significant increases during key conferences and the COVID-19 pandemic. These findings underscore the importance of continued transparency and scrutiny in industry-oncology financial interactions to mitigate potential conflicts of interest in oncology care.",,,pranasi1@jhmi.edu.
39614088,The application of rigid gas permeable contact lenses after surgery for infantile nystagmus syndrome.,2024-11-30,Scientific reports,10.1038/s41598-024-81584-8,"The purpose of this study is to investigate the improvement in visual acuity when applying Rigid Gas Permeable Contact Lenses (RGPCL) compared to spectacles in patients after surgical treatment for infantile nystagmus syndrome (INS). A total of 33 patients with nystagmus who had nystagmus surgery from October 2020 to July 2021 were enrolled and all were fitted RGPCL. SPSS statistical software was used to analyze the difference between best-corrected visual acuity with spectacle(BCSVA) and best-corrected visual acuity with RGPCL (BCRVA) in these patients. According to the refractive status of each eye, it was grouped into 2 groups. We study the difference between its BCSVA and BCRVA in different groups. In our study, BCRVA was significantly better than BCSVA in all participants (P < 0.001), with a strong positive correlation between them (overall r = 0.9333). In Group A (SE ≥ -3.00D, 15 eyes), the difference was significant (P = 0.0018), while in Group B (SE < -3.00D, 27 eyes), the difference was highly significant (P < 0.001). However, there was no significant difference in corrective visual acuity between the two groups (P = 0.5934). The mean difference between BCRVA and BCSVA was - 0.1160 ± 0.1221 in all participants, with similar differences in both groups. These findings suggest that BCRVA and BCSVA are closely related but with significant differences. The results of our study show that for patients who have undergone surgery for INS, RGPCL provide better best-corrected visual acuity compared to spectacle correction. This holds true for patients with high myopia, low myopia, and hyperopia. We recommend the use of RGPCL for refractive correction in patients after surgery for INS.",Jin Y; Wang H; Zhen N,Itabashi Medical (Dalian) Limited Liability Company,yue.ue@163.com.

In July 2023, SV95C received European Medicines Agency (EMA) qualification for use as a primary endpoint in trials of patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) aged ≥ 4 years-becoming the first digital endpoint to receive such qualification. We present the data supporting this qualification, providing insights into the evidentiary basis of qualification as a digital clinical outcome assessment. Clinical trials, natural history studies, and patient surveys (ages 5 - 14 years) showed that SV95C is accurate, valid, reliable, sensitive, and clinically meaningful. SV95C significantly correlated with traditional DMD assessments, increased rapidly after steroid initiation (0.090 m/s 3 months post-treatment), and declined steadily in patients on stable steroid regimens. Compared with traditional assessments, SV95C demonstrated earlier sensitivity to disease progression (3 vs 9 months) and greater sensitivity at 12 months. Distribution- and anchor-based approaches revealed a change of - 0.10 to - 0.20 m/s as clinically meaningful.

The CAPE is intended to provide a safe environment for care receipt and delivery when isolation capacity is limited. The goal of this study was to evaluate the acceptability of receiving care in the CAPE from the emergency department (ED) patient perspective. For this prospective, observational study, adult ED patients receiving care in the CAPE were asked to participate in an anonymous survey upon conclusion of the patient encounter. Survey domains included comfort, ability to see and communicate with care team members, space adequacy, perceptions of safety, and the ease of entering and exiting the device. Participants provided responses using a five-point Likert-type scale. Ten adult patients participated during a 68-day evaluation period in a tertiary care ED. A total of seven completed the survey (70 %); the remaining three did not complete the survey due to illness severity. The median time spent in the device was 190 min. The median degree of comfort inside the CAPE was 5.0. Participants rated their ability to see their surroundings as median 5.0. The median score for ability to communicate with their medical team inside the CAPE was 5.0. Patients reported feeling safe inside the device with a median of 5.0 and most felt there was enough space inside with a median 5.0. The IQR for each of the above metrics was 5.0 and 5.0. Additionally participants also found it easy to mobilize in and out of the CAPE, with a median score of 5.0, IQR 4.0, 5.05. In this pilot, prospective, observational study with adult ED patients, the majority of patients found the CAPE comfortable and safe, providing adequate space, and easily accessed.

39608004,Wearables and Smartphones for Tracking Modifiable Risk Factors in Metabolic Health: Protocol for a Scoping Review.,2024-11-28,JMIR research protocols,10.2196/59539,"Metabolic diseases, such as cardiovascular diseases and diabetes, contribute significantly to global mortality and disability. Wearable devices and smartphones are increasingly used to track and manage modifiable risk factors associated with metabolic diseases. However, no established guidelines exist on how to derive meaningful signals from these devices, often hampering cross-study comparisons. This study aims to systematically overview the current empirical literature on how wearables and smartphones are used to track modifiable (physiological and lifestyle) risk factors associated with metabolic diseases. We will conduct a scoping review to overview how wearable and smartphone-based studies measure modifiable risk factors related to metabolic diseases. We will search 5 databases (Scopus, Web of Science, PubMed, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and SPORTDiscus) from 2019 to 2024, with search terms related to wearables, smartphones, and modifiable risk factors associated with metabolic diseases. Eligible studies will use smartphones or wearables (worn on the wrist, finger, arm, hip, and chest) to track physiological or lifestyle factors related to metabolic diseases. We will follow the reporting guideline standards from PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews) and the JBI (Joanna Briggs Institute) guidance on scoping review methodology. Two reviewers will independently screen articles for inclusion and extract data using a standardized form. The findings will be synthesized and reported qualitatively and quantitatively. Data collection is expected to begin in November 2024; data analysis in the first quarter of 2025; and submission to a peer-reviewed journal by the second quarter of 2025. We expect to identify the degree to which wearable and smartphone-based studies track modifiable risk factors collectively (versus in isolation), and the consistency and variation in how modifiable risk factors are measured across existing studies. Results are expected to inform more standardized guidelines on wearable and smartphone-based measurements, with the goal of aiding cross-study comparison. The final report is planned for submission to a peer-reviewed, indexed journal. This review is among the first to systematically overview the current landscape on how wearables and smartphones measure modifiable risk factors associated with metabolic diseases.

Cardiovascular interventions,10.1016/j.jcin.2024.08.030,"Abbreviated antiplatelet therapy (APT) reduces bleeding without increasing ischemic events in largely unselected high bleeding risk (HBR) patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Diabetes mellitus (DM) is associated with higher ischemic risk, and its impact on the safety and effectiveness of abbreviated APT in HBR PCI patients remains unknown. This study sought to investigate the comparative effectiveness of abbreviated (1 month) vs standard (≥3 months) APT in HBR patients with and without DM after biodegradable polymer sirolimus-eluting coronary stent implantation. This was a prespecified analysis from the MASTER DAPT (Management of High Bleeding Risk Patients Post Bioresorbable Polymer Coated Stent Implantation With a Abbreviated Versus Prolonged DAPT Regimen) trial, which randomized 4,579 HBR patients (1,538 [34%] with DM) to abbreviated (n = 2,295) or standard (n = 2,284) APT. The coprimary outcomes were net adverse clinical events (NACEs; composite of all-cause death, myocardial infarction, stroke, and major bleeding), major adverse cardiac or cerebral events (MACCEs; all-cause death, myocardial infarction, and stroke), and major or clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding at 11 months. HBR patients with DM had higher risks of MACCEs (HR: 1.28; 95% CI: 1.00-1.63) and similar net adverse or bleeding events compared with nondiabetic subjects. Abbreviated compared with standard APT was associated with similar NACEs and MACCEs (P MACCE and NACE rates were similar, and bleeding rates were lower with abbreviated APT in patients with or without diabetes.

However the regulatory science of this emerging dosage form is immature and explicit regulatory guidance is limited. A group of international stakeholders has formed to identify and address key issues for the regulatory science of future products that combine a microneedle device and active pharmaceutical ingredient (in solid or semi-solid state) in a single entity that is designed for application to the skin. Guided by the principles of Quality by Design (QbD) and informed by consultation with wider stakeholders, this 'White Paper' describes fundamental elements of the work in an effort to harmonise understanding, stimulate discussion and guide innovation. The paper discusses classification of the dosage form (combination/medicinal product), the regulatory nomenclature that is likely to be adopted and the technical vocabulary that best describes its form and function. More than twenty potential critical quality attributes (CQAs) are identified for the dosage form, and a prioritisation exercise identifies those CQAs that are most pertinent to the dosage form and that will likely require bespoke test methods (delivered dose, puncture performance) or major adaptions to established compendial test methods (dissolution).

Thus, modulation of glucagon receptor (GCGR) activity in the context of single-molecule multi-receptor co-agonists has become an emerging therapeutic target against obesity and obesity-associated metabolic dysfunction. To better elucidate the role of GCGR-signaling when paired with incretin receptor signaling or on its own, we developed, LY3324954, a GCGR agonist with improved potency and selectivity as compared to the native glucagon peptide. LY3324954 was administered to DIO mice, rats, dogs, and monkeys to evaluate pharmacokinetic (PK) profile. Biweekly treatments were conducted in lean and DIO mice to characterize LY3324954-effects on glucose homeostasis and energy balance. Single dose studies were also conducted in liver Gcgr-deficient mice to establish receptor specificity. LY3324954 also exhibited extended PK profile in DIO mice, rats, dogs, and monkeys. When administered every 72 h, LY3324954 treatment stimulated transient glucose and insulin excursions in lean mice. In diet-induced obese mice, LY3324954 treatment stimulates energy expenditure, weight loss, and a reduction of adiposity in a dose-dependent manner. Benefit to whole-body lipid homeostasis was likewise observed in these mice. Taken together, these studies characterize a long-acting and potent GCGR-agonist and its regulation of glucose and lipid metabolism as well as whole-body energy balance following both acute and chronic treatment in mice.",Roell W; Coskun T; O'Farrell L; Martin JA; Sloop KW; Steele JP; Alsina-Fernandez J,Lilly Research Laboratories,alsina-fernandez_jorge@lilly.com.

We explored the relationships between accelerometer measures of physical activity and 6-minute walk distance and patient-reported measures of functional limitation in participants across the entire spectrum of left ventricular ejection fraction in the DETERMINE (Dapagliflozin EffecT on ExeRcise capacity using a 6-MINutE walk test in patients with heart failure) trials. A subgroup of patients in the DETERMINE trials wore a waist-based accelerometer during 7-day periods at 3 points during the trial: between screening and randomization and during weeks 8 and 14. Patients completed the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ) and 6-minute walk distance (6MWD) at baseline and at weeks 8 and 16. Of the 817 patients randomized, 319 (39%) had adequate baseline accelerometer data. Patients with lower levels of physical activity had lower (ie, worse) KCCQ scores and 6MWD, higher NT-proBNP levels and BMIs, worse kidney function, and a greater likelihood of diabetes and atrial fibrillation. Baseline accelerometer values had weak correlations with KCCQ summary scores (Pearson r = 0.06-0.21) and weak to moderate correlations with 6MWD (Pearson r = 0.20-0.31). The change from baseline to 16 weeks in accelerometer-measured physical activity correlated weakly with the change in KCCQ summary scores (Pearson r = 0-0.18) and 6MWD (r = 0.01-0.10).

In a maritime field study 976 seafarers on 65 merchant ships participated in the survey carried out with a questionnaire. The vast majority (98.4%) of the respondents had a mobile device on board. 52.5% stated to already have downloaded a health app, with a higher proportion among the officers (adjusted Odds Ratio (aOR) 1.67; 95% CI (1.13-2.50)). The most common reasons for downloading this kind of app were activity tracking (74.8%), weight loss (41.8%) and exercise (41.0%). Officers downloaded apps significantly more often for activity tracking (p< 0.001) and sleep tracking (p = 0.001). 51.1% of downloaders stopped the use of a health app. Frequent reasons for not downloading or stopping the use of a health app were loss/absence of interest and that the desired health apps could not be used offline. Frequency and duration of use were highest at home, followed by the use at sea and then in port. No correlation between the WHO Well-being Index and the use of health apps could be found. Overall, two kinds of obstacles to implementing app-based health intervention could be identified: maritime-specific obstacles and general obstacles (obstacles not exclusively assignable to the naval environment); the maritime-specific obstacles primarily consisted of being offline for long periods of time and limited recreational time. Among the most important general problems were economic and social problems as well as a significant loss/absence of interest. Nevertheless, the basic requirements for an app-based health prevention for seafarers seem to be in place. Measures taken by the shipping company could consist of providing internet access for app usage and educating seafarers on the benefits of health apps. Providing preselected options and guidance on app selection and licenses for paid apps could further encourage usage among seafarers and strengthen success of an app-based health intervention eventually leading to improved physical and mental health in their employees. Additionally, if follow-up maritime studies can objectively demonstrate benefits and positive health effects, the International Maritime Organization (IMO) could officially recommend the use of health apps as a health management measure and play an important political role by recommending and supporting the development of health apps specifically designed for maritime conditions with key features like offline availability.",,,
39602213,Benefits of Clinical Decision Support Systems for the Management of Noncommunicable Chronic Diseases: Targeted Literature Review.,,Interactive journal of medical research,10.2196/58036,"Clinical decision support systems (CDSSs) are designed to assist in health care delivery by supporting medical practice with clinical knowledge, patient information, and other relevant types of health information. CDSSs are integral parts of health care technologies assisting in disease management, including diagnosis, treatment, and monitoring. While electronic medical records (EMRs) serve as data repositories, CDSSs are used to assist clinicians in providing personalized, context-specific recommendations derived by comparing individual patient data to evidence-based guidelines. This targeted literature review (TLR) aimed to identify characteristics and features of both stand-alone and EMR-integrated CDSSs that influence their outcomes and benefits based on published scientific literature. A TLR was conducted using the Embase, MEDLINE, and Cochrane databases to identify data on CDSSs published in a 10-year frame (2012-2022). Studies on computerized, guideline-based CDSSs used by health care practitioners with a focus on chronic disease areas and reporting outcomes for CDSS utilization were eligible for inclusion. A total of 49 publications were included in the TLR. Studies predominantly reported on EMR-integrated CDSSs (ie, connected to an EMR database; n=32, 65%). The implementation of CDSSs varied globally, with substantial utilization in the United States and within the domain of cardio-renal-metabolic diseases. CDSSs were found to positively impact ""quality assurance"" (n=35, 69%) and provide ""clinical benefits"" (n=20, 41%), compared to usual care. Among CDSS features, treatment guidance and flagging were consistently reported as the most frequent elements for enhancing health care, followed by risk level estimation, diagnosis, education, and data export. The effectiveness of a CDSS was evaluated most frequently in primary care settings (n=34, 69%) across cardio-renal-metabolic disease areas (n=32, 65%), especially in diabetes (n=13, 26%). Studies reported CDSSs to be commonly used by a mixed group (n=27, 55%) of users including physicians, specialists, nurses or nurse practitioners, and allied health care professionals. Overall, both EMR-integrated and stand-alone CDSSs showed positive results, suggesting their benefits to health care providers and potential for successful adoption. Flagging and treatment recommendation features were commonly used in CDSSs to improve patient care; other features such as risk level estimation, diagnosis, education, and data export were tailored to specific requirements and collectively contributed to the effectiveness of health care delivery. While this TLR demonstrated that both stand-alone and EMR-integrated CDSSs were successful in achieving clinical outcomes, the heterogeneity of included studies reflects the evolving nature of this research area, underscoring the need for further longitudinal studies to elucidate aspects that may impact their adoption in real-world scenarios.",Grechuta K; Shokouh P; Alhussein A; Meyerhoff J; Purushotham S; Rolland C,PPD Australia Pty Ltd; Adivus Medical Consultancy Mpv.; Evidera; Boehringer Ingelheim International GmbH,

Triptans are not suitable as first-line treatment for all patients with migraine due to contraindications, lack of efficacy, and/or poor tolerability. However, there is debate about the frequency and characteristics of these patients and the burden they experience. MEDLINE, Embase, and conference abstracts (2011-2022) were reviewed for evidence on patients with migraine unsuitable for triptans for any reason. Data from publications describing the frequency and characteristics of this group, as well as the clinical, humanistic, or economic burden of disease in this population, were extracted. Of 1460 records screened, 29 publications met inclusion criteria. Persistence with triptans was low; 51%-66% of patients starting a new triptan did not refill it, and 43%-100% discontinued their initial triptan over 2 years. In one study, 14% of patients with migraine reported prior discontinuation/failure of ≥ 2 triptans due to inadequate efficacy or poor tolerability. Up to 15% of patients with migraine had triptan contraindications, and ≥ 20% of patients receiving triptans had contraindications. In four studies, 10%-44% of patients who tried triptans had insufficient response, although definitions varied. Patients who achieved a sufficient response typically did so with their first triptan; few became responders with additional triptans. Of patients who did not respond to one to two triptans and received another, 45% were dissatisfied with the final triptan. Approximately half of patients who tried two to three triptans had an insufficient response. Greater disability, impact of disease, and depression were reported in triptan discontinuers compared to those with sustained use. Worse quality of life scores and utility values were reported in triptan insufficient versus sufficient responders, as were greater migraine-related costs, work impairment, and health-care resource utilization. The total population of patients unsuitable for triptans is uncertain, but the literature highlights a large group who cannot or do not persist with triptans, and current evidence suggests a high burden in this population and an unmet need for new therapeutic options.

39599311,Co-Optimization of Mechanical Properties and Radiopacity Through Radiopaque Filler Incorporation for Medical Tubing Applications.,,Polymers,10.3390/polym16223220,"Medical tubing, particularly cardiovascular tubing, is a critical area of research where continuous improvements are necessary to advance medical devices and improve patient care. While polymers are fundamental for these applications, on their own they present several limitations such as insufficient X-ray contrasting capabilities. As such, polymer composites utilizing radiopaque fillers are a necessity for this application. For medical tubing in vivo, radiopacity is a crucial parameter that virgin polymers alone fall short in achieving due to limited X-ray absorption. To address this shortcoming, inorganic radiopaque fillers such as barium sulphate (BaSO",Nugent A; Molloy J; Kelly M,Innovative Polymer Compounds (IPC),
39599106,A Microfluidic-Based Sensing Platform for Rapid Quality Control on Target Cells from Bioreactors.,2024-11-27,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",10.3390/s24227329,"We investigated the design and characterization of a Lab-On-a-Chip (LoC) cell detection system primarily designed to support immunotherapy in cancer treatment. Immunotherapy uses Chimeric Antigen Receptors (CARs) and T Cell Receptors (TCRs) to fight cancer, engineering the response of the immune system. In recent years, it has emerged as a promising strategy for personalized cancer treatment. However, it requires bioreactor-based cell culture expansion and manual quality control (QC) of the modified cells, which is time-consuming, labour-intensive, and prone to errors. The miniaturized LoC device for automated QC demonstrated here is simple, has a low cost, and is reliable. Its final target is to become one of the building blocks of an LoC for immunotherapy, which would take the place of present labs and manual procedures to the benefit of throughput and affordability. The core of the system is a commercial, on-chip-integrated capacitive sensor managed by a microcontroller capable of sensing cells as accurately measured charge variations. The hardware is based on standardized components, which makes it suitable for mass manufacturing. Moreover, unlike in other cell detection solutions, no external AC source is required. The device has been characterized with a cell line model selectively labelled with gold nanoparticles to simulate its future use in bioreactors in which labelling can apply to successfully engineered CAR-T-cells. Experiments were run both in the air-free drop with no microfluidics-and in the channel, where the fluid volume was considerably lower than in the drop. The device showed good sensitivity even with a low number of cells-around 120, compared with the 10",,,
39597757,Regulatory Standard for Determining Preoperative Skin Preparation Efficacy Underreports True Dermal Bioburden in a Porcine Model.,,Microorganisms,10.3390/microorganisms12112369,"Medical device companies and regulatory bodies rely on a nondestructive bacterial sampling technique specified by the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM E1173-15) to test preoperative skin preparations (PSPs). Despite the widespread use of PSPs, opportunistic skin-flora pathogens remain the most significant contributor to surgical site infections, suggesting that the ASTM testing standard may be underreporting true dermal bioburden. We hypothesized that ASTM E1173-15 may fail to capture deep skin-dwelling flora. To test this hypothesis, we applied ASTM E1173-15 and a full-thickness skin sampling technique, which we established previously through application to the backs of seven pigs (Yorkshire/Landrace hybrid) following a clinically used PSP (4% chlorhexidine gluconate). The results showed that samples quantified using the full-thickness skin method consistently cultured more bacteria than the ASTM standard, which principally targeted surface-dwelling bacteria. Following PSP, the ASTM standard yielded 1.05 ± 0.24 log",,,

A retrospective analysis was conducted on video recordings captured by the SEC from 46 patients with dry eye disease (DED). Separate sets of images were created for each level of enhancement: unenhanced (G0), mildly enhanced (G3), and strongly enhanced (G7). These sets were not intermixed, ensuring that each enhancement level was assessed independently. Three observers-two DED specialists and one general ophthalmologist-assessed TBUT, TMH, CFS scores, and conjunctivochalasis. Interobserver reliability was evaluated using intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) for each image set. Interobserver reliability for CFS scores significantly improved with G3, yielding an ICC of 0.8413. In contrast, G7 improved reliability for TBUT measurements (ICC = 0.7381), but led to a notable decrease in reliability for both CFS scoring (ICC = 0.2259) and conjunctivochalasis detection (ICC = 0.0786). Furthermore, the assessment of TMH demonstrated a progressive decline in accuracy with increasing levels of image enhancement. Image enhancement using the SEC improved the diagnostic consistency of dry eye specialists and general ophthalmologists, especially for TBUT and CFS assessments. However, excessive enhancement may obscure key diagnostic features, indicating the need for careful optimization of image processing techniques depending on the diagnostic focus.",Sato S; Asai K; Inoue T; Shimizu E; Shimazaki J,Akasaka Shimazaki Eye Clinic; Yokohama Keiai Eye Clinic; OUI Inc.,

It was first approved in 2019. A group of doctors with various specialties, who have used VYC-25L extensively since it first became available in their countries (3-5 years), share clinical experience and guidance on optimal use. VYC-25L has a unique rheological and physicochemical profile that provides elevated lift capacity and enhanced projection, significant moldability immediately after injection, high levels of tissue integration, reversibility with hyaluronidase, and a long duration of clinical effects-typically lasting at least 24 months. The properties of VYC-25L have created new possibilities for nonsurgical facial medical aesthetics. However, as with any novel product, it is important that injectors recognize how best to use it for the benefit of patients. When first utilizing VYC-25L, it is advisable to start with the chin and jawline to gain familiarity with the gel characteristics before moving into other facial areas, and to consider splitting treatment over two or more sessions. Attention must also be given to injection volume, with less product typically required with VYC-25L compared to other fillers with similar indications. Key principles of good practice should be followed, including appropriate patient selection and pretreatment education, suitable choice of injection device and plane, aseptic technique, slow and careful administration method, and sufficient posttreatment follow-up. By adhering to these principles, VYC-25L can produce natural-looking and highly durable outcomes without substantial safety concerns.",Bertossi D; Denkova R; Hoo AJS; Loh D; Murdoch M; Urdiales-Gálvez F; de Aguiar Menezes MV; de la Guardia C,Instituto Médico Miramar; Knysna Advanced Health Medical Centre; David Loh Surgery; Anna Hoo Clinic; Cosmiatry for Doctor; Department of Maxillo Facial Surgery; Dr. Denkova Dermatology; Global Aesthetics Medical Affairs,

AMI biomarkers, such as cardiac troponin I (cTnI), are often detected with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) that suffers from several well-known drawbacks such as poor stability and slow and cumbersome operation. Therefore, it is necessary to develop a new analytical technique that can rapidly analyse and detect cTnI for early screening of AMI. In this work, a nanoporous electrochemical aptamer-based (E-AB) sensor for rapid and sensitivite detect of cTnI was designed. Firstly, the aptamer was truncated, and then molecular docking simulation and circular dichroism (CD) were used to screen for aptamers with significant conformational changes when binding to the target, in order to enhance the sensitivity of E-AB sensors. Subsequently, nanoporous electrodes with active area 20 times higher than that of smooth electrodes were fabricated by electrochemical alloying/dealloying, which enabled E-AB sensors to obtain higher signal-to-noise ratios, providing favorable assurance for the detection results. Under optimal conditions, E-AB sensors could specifically detect cTnI in serum and blood with a detection limit of 1 pg/mL. At the same time, the sensor and enzyme-linked immunoassay (ELISA) had identical detection results when measuring target levels from real clinical samples. Furthermore, the sensor exhibited good reproducibility, stability, providing a simple and low-cost method for detecting cTnI, which is expected to help early AMI patients obtain accurate diagnosis.",,,jjsun@fzu.edu.cn.

However, the detection of low molecular weight analytes with high sensitivity and specificity remains a complex and unresolved issue, posing significant limitations for the advancement of clinical diagnostic tools and medical device technologies. Notably, abnormal cholesterol levels are a well-established indicator of various pathological conditions; yet, the quantitative detection of the free form of cholesterol is complicated by its small molecular size, pronounced hydrophobicity, and the necessity for mediator molecules to achieve efficient sensing. In the present study, a novel strategy for cholesterol quantification was developed, leveraging a plasmonic optical readout in conjunction with a highly specific cholesterol-binding peptide (C-pept) as a biorecognition element, anchored on a functionalized silica substrate. The resulting biosensor exhibited an exceptionally low detection limit of 21.95 µM and demonstrated a linear response in the 10-200 µM range. This peptide-integrated plasmonic sensor introduces a novel one-step competitive method for cholesterol quantification, positioning itself as a highly sensitive biosensing modality for implementation within the AVAC platform, which operates using reflective dark-field microscopy.",Parra A; Cebrián V; Ahumada Ó,Mecwins S.A.,

This study investigates the potential of ozone nanobubble water, an aqueous solution known for its strong oxidizing and sterilizing properties, to modify the surface of titanium dental implants. By immersing the implants in ozone nanobubble water for ∼10 min, we observed a significant transformation of their surface characteristics. Implant surfaces that had become hydrophobic over time, likely due to organic contaminants, became superhydrophilic, exhibiting a contact angle near zero. Fresh implant material is initially hydrophilic but becomes hydrophobic within a few days of drying. In sharp contrast, the hydrophilicity induced by ozone nanobubble water treatment persisted for more than one month. This durability suggests not only the removal of organic matter through cleaning but also a substantial alteration in the surface properties of the implants. The generation of ozone nanobubble water involved releasing ozone microbubbles into an aqueous solution containing trace amounts of iron and manganese, resulting in spherical particles with an average diameter of ∼10 nm. These particles could be bulk nanobubbles, a stabilized gas body surrounded by a solid shell composed of iron hydroxide. Termed ""nanoshells"" in our previous study, these particles demonstrated exceptional dispersibility without the need for stabilizing agents such as surfactants or capping agents, attributed to their inherent high wettability. The sustained hydrophilicity of the implant surfaces might be attributed to the adherence of these hydrophilic nanoshells to the implant's surface. This study highlights the potential of ozone nanobubble water for long-term surface modification of dental implants, offering a promising avenue for enhancing implant biocompatibility.",Nakazawa M; Nishimoto T; Odajima M,Nakazawa Dental Clinic; Nanosui Company; Nikken Rentacom Company,
39585967,The composition of commercially available human embryo culture media.,2025-01-06,"Human reproduction (Oxford, England)",10.1093/humrep/deae248,"What is the composition of currently available commercial human embryo culture media provided by seven suppliers, for each stage of human preimplantation embryo development? While common trends existed across brands, distinct differences in composition underlined the absence of a clear standard for human embryo culture medium formulation. The reluctance of manufacturers to fully disclose the composition of their human embryo culture media generates uncertainty regarding the culture conditions that are used for human preimplantation embryo culture. The critical role of the embryo culture environment is well-recognized, with proven effects on IVF success rates and child outcomes, such as birth weight. The lack of comprehensive composition details restricts research efforts crucial for enhancing our understanding of its impacts on these outcomes. The ongoing demand for greater transparency remains unmet, highlighting a significant barrier in embryo culture medium optimization. For this study, 47 different human embryo culture media and protein supplements were purchased between December 2019 and June 2020; they comprise complete media (n = 23), unsupplemented media (n = 14), and supplements (n = 10). Unsupplemented media were supplemented with each available supplement from the same brand (n = 33 combinations). All samples were directly frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80°C until composition analysis. We determined the concentrations of 40 components in all samples collected (n = 80). Seven electrolytes (calcium, chloride, iron, magnesium, phosphate, potassium, sodium), glucose, immunoglobulins A, G, and M (IgA, IgG, IgM), uric acid, alanine aminotransferase (ALAT), aspartate aminotransferase (ASAT), and albumin, as well as the total protein concentration, were determined in each sample using a Cobas 8000 Analyser (Roche Diagnostics). Analysis of pyruvate, lactate, carnitine, and 21 amino acids was achieved with Ultra-High Performance Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS). Our analysis showed that generally, the concentrations of components of ready-to-use human embryo culture media align with established assumptions about the changing needs of an embryo during early development. For instance, glucose concentrations displayed a high-low-high pattern in sequential media systems from all brands: 2.5-3 mM in most fertilization media, 0.5 mM or below in all cleavage stage media, and 2.5-3.3 mM in most blastocyst stage media. Continuous media generally resembled glucose concentrations of cleavage stage media. However, for other components, such as lactate, glycine, and potassium, we observed clear differences in medium composition across different brands. No two embryo culture media compositions were the same. Remarkably, even embryo culture media from brands that belong to the same parent company differed in composition. Additionally, the scientific backing for the specific concentrations used and the differences in the composition of sequential media is quite limited and often based on minimal in vivo studies of limited sample size or studies using animal models. N/A. We used a targeted approach and performed a selection of tests which limit the composition analysis to this set of analytes. Comprehensive disclosure and complete transparency concerning the composition of human embryo culture media, including the exact concentration of each component, are crucial for evidence-based improvements of culture media for human preimplantation embryos.

However, increasing evidence suggests the involvement of ipsilateral cortical networks in this process, especially in motor tasks requiring bilateral coordination, such as locomotion. In this study, we combined a unilateral thoracic spinal cord injury (SCI) with a cortical neuroprosthetic approach to investigate the functional role of the ipsilateral motor cortex in rat movement through spared contralesional pathways. Our findings reveal that in all SCI rats, stimulation of the ipsilesional motor cortex promoted a bilateral synergy. This synergy involved the elevation of the contralateral foot along with ipsilateral hindlimb extension. Additionally, in two out of seven animals, stimulation of a sub-region of the hindlimb motor cortex modulated ipsilateral hindlimb flexion. Importantly, ipsilateral cortical stimulation delivered after SCI immediately alleviated multiple locomotor and postural deficits, and this effect persisted after ablation of the homologous motor cortex. These results provide strong evidence of a causal link between cortical activation and precise ipsilateral control of hindlimb movement. This study has significant implications for the development of future neuroprosthetic technology and our understanding of motor control in the context of SCI.",Massai E; Bonizzato M; De Jesus I; Drainville R; Martinez M,Département de Neurosciences,

Remote ischemic conditioning (RIC), where brief cycles of ischemia-reperfusion in a limb are induced to protect the brain, is a promising treatment for this setting. We assessed the usability of a novel RIC system in a simulated emergency response scenario. Paramedics were asked to use the RIC device in an emergency stroke care and ambulance transport simulation, overseen by a confederate. Feedback on device use was collected through questionnaires, including the System Usability Scale (SUS) and the NASA Task Load Index (NASA-TLX), and a semi-structured interview. Questionnaire responses were summarized using descriptive statistics; interview transcripts were analyzed thematically. Nine paramedics (including the confederate) participated, with a mean of 10.0 ± 10.3 years of professional experience. Questionnaire responses indicated high device usability (mean SUS score: 85.3 ± 12.9 out of 100) and low task-related demands, effort, and frustration (mean NASA-TLX domain scores: ≤3.9 out of 20). Seven paramedics stated they would use the device in daily practice. They expressed concerns related to display screen clarity, interference with standard procedures, cable management, device fragility, and patient discomfort. Suggested improvements included adding indicators of device performance and refining the cuff design. While the device was considered easy to use, paramedics also identified important areas of improvement. With a small, localized study sample, our findings are primarily applicable to the refinement of the RICovery system for use in future clinical trials in the same healthcare setting. However, feedback on the importance of mitigating potential interference of newly introduced procedures with those already established, robustness of equipment, and effective paramedic-patient communication may also help inform the design of other pre-hospital interventions.",,,

This includes the 40% of healthcare that is harmful or low value, adding avoidable emissions without improving health or quality of care. Clinicians are well-placed to mitigate emissions associated with the provision of clinical care. This study aimed to explore clinicians' views on a new construct we have termed 'carbon health literacy' to understand how knowledge, skills and capacities related to the emissions of clinical care has application in clinical practice. Qualitative interviews were conducted between August 2022 and February 2023 with clinicians from Australia (n = 15) and Canada (n = 13). Clinicians with an interest in climate change and healthcare sustainability were sampled from a variety of clinical specialty areas, such as primary care, nursing, anaesthetics, and emergency. Clinicians were recruited through advertising on social media and via professional networks. A pre-piloted interview schedule was used to guide the interviews. Interviews were audio recorded, transcribed verbatim and analysed using framework analysis. Participants viewed carbon health literacy as an increasingly important skill for clinicians to have or acquire, though they reported that the level of carbon health literacy and knowledge needed varies by job roles, clinical specialty areas, and individual capacity to generate healthcare system change. Many clinicians reported implementing strategies to mitigate their work-related GHG emissions, such as reducing waste or choosing lower carbon commuting options. There was limited awareness of reducing low-value care as a strategy to decrease emissions. All participants had encountered barriers to providing low-carbon care, including managing patient expectations, inadequate training and information, and limited capacity to generate system change in their organisational roles. To support the delivery of high value low carbon healthcare, work is needed to build the carbon health literacy of clinicians and remove other barriers currently impeding their capacity to practice and promote sustainable clinical care.",McGain F,Wiser Healthcare research collaboration,kristen.pickles@sydney.edu.au.

However, complex multi-level confounding related not only to patient-level but also to surgeon or hospital covariates hampers observational studies of risks and benefits. We conducted parametric and plasmode simulations to compare the performance of cardinality matching (CM) vs propensity score matching (PSM) to reduce confounding bias in the presence of cluster-level confounding. Two Monte Carlo simulation studies were carried out: 1) Parametric simulations (1,000 iterations) with patients nested in clusters (ratio 10:1, 50:1, 100:1, 200:1, 500:1) and sample size n = 10,000 were conducted with patient and cluster level confounders; 2) Plasmode simulations generated from a cohort of 9981 patients admitted for pancreatectomy between 2015 to 2019 from a US hospital database. CM with 0.1 standardised mean different constraint threshold (SMD) for confounders and PSM were used to balance the confounders for within-cluster and cross-cluster matching. Treatment effects were then estimated using logistic regression as the outcome model on the obtained matched sample. CM yielded higher sample retention but more bias than PSM for cross-cluster matching in most scenarios. For instance, with ratio of 100:1, sample retention and relative bias were 97.1% and 26.5% for CM, compared to 82.5% and 12.2% for PSM. The results for plasmode simulation were similar. CM offered better sample retention but higher bias in most scenarios compared to PSM. More research is needed to guide the use of CM particularly in constraint setting for confounders for medical device and surgical epidemiology.",Johnston S; Coplan PM; Strauss VY,Epidemiology & Real-World Data Sciences; Boehringer Ingelheim Pharma GmbH and Co KG,daniel.prietoalhambra@ndorms.ox.ac.uk.

However, current devices often focus on a single body part for specific physical parameters, which hinders the seamless integration of sensors across multiple body parts and necessitates redesign for new detection capabilities. Here, we propose a modular, reconfigurable circuit assembly method that can be adaptable for multiple body locations to construct the body net. By simply reassembling different child modules with the base module using flexible printed circuit board connectors, we can efficiently detect various parameters including sweat ion indicators, electrocardiogram signals, electromyography signals, motion data, heart rate, blood oxygen saturation, and skin temperature. These data can be transmitted to a mobile phone app via a Bluetooth Low Energy protocol for further evaluation. Comparative evaluations against established commercial devices substantiate the viability of our sensor technology.

However, studies examining whether similar discrepancies exist in RCTs focusing on gastrointestinal and liver diseases are limited. This study aimed to assess the extent of discrepancies between registered and published primary outcomes in RCTs featured in journals specializing in gastroenterology and hepatology. We retrospectively retrieved RCTs published between January 1, 2017 and December 31, 2021 in the top three journals from each quartile ranking of the 2020 Journal Citation Reports within the ""Gastroenterology and Hepatology"" subcategory. We extracted data on trial characteristics, registration details, and pre-specified versus published primary outcomes. Pre-specified primary outcomes were retrieved from the World Health Organization's International Clinical Trials Registry Platform. Only trials reporting specific primary outcomes were included in analyzing primary outcome discrepancies. We also assessed whether there was a potential reporting bias that deemed to favor statistically significant outcomes. Statistical analyses included chi-square tests, Fisher's exact tests, univariate analyses, and logistic regression. Of 362 articles identified, 312 (86.2%) were registered, and 79.8% of the registrations (249 out of 312) were prospective. Among the 285 trials reporting primary outcomes, 76 (26.7%) exhibited at least one discrepancy between registered and published primary outcomes. The most common discrepancies included different assessment times for the primary outcome (n = 32, 42.1%), omitting the registered primary outcome in publications (n = 21, 27.6%), and reporting the registered secondary outcomes as primary outcomes (n = 13, 17.1%). Univariate analyses revealed that primary outcome discrepancies were lower in the publication year 2020 compared to year 2021 (OR = 0.267, 95% CI: 0.101, 0.706, p = 0.008). Among the 76 studies with primary outcome discrepancies, 20 (26.3%) studies were retrospectively registered, and 32 (57.1%) of the prospectively registered trials with primary outcome discrepancies showed statistically significant results. However, no significant differences were found between journal quartiles regarding primary outcome consistency and potential reporting bias (p = 0.14 and p = 0.28, respectively). This study highlights the disparities between registered and published primary outcomes in RCTs within gastroenterology and hepatology journals.

Some MBs will end up as microemboli in the lung, heart, and brain. MB exposure has no medical purpose and is considered to be bio-incompatible. Selecting venous chambers with a high removal rate of MBs is warranted to reduce the risks of air bio-incompatibility. The primary aim was to compare the Fresenius 5008 (F5008-VC) and the Emboless Twenty patients underwent 80 sessions of cross-over HD using both the F5008-VC and the Emboless-VC randomized such that half started with the F5008-VC and half with the Emboless-VC. For 32 of the 80 sessions, measurements were also performed during hemodiafiltrations (HDF) after the initial HD. MBs were measured with an ultrasound device (within the size range of 20-500 µm) at the ""inlet"" and ""outlet"" bloodline of the venous chambers. The Wilcoxon pairwise test compared the percentage of MB elimination between venous chambers. During HD, the median reduction of MBs for the outlet was 39% with the F5008-VC and 76% with the Emboless-VC ( Fewer MBs and subsequently fewer microemboli entered the bloodline of the patient using the Emboless-VC compared to the F5008-VC venous chamber during HD and during HDF.

Older age is a strong predictor of delirium. Intraoperative burst suppression on the electroencephalogram (EEG) has also been linked to postoperative delirium and poor neurocognitive outcomes. In this a secondary analysis of data from the Perioperative Anesthesia Neurocognitive Disorder Assessment-Geriatric (PANDA-G) observational study, the raw EEGs of 239 spine surgery patients were evaluated. Associations between delirium and age, device-generated burst suppression ratio, and visual detection of the raw EEG were compared. Demographics and anesthesia durations were similar in patients with and without delirium. There was a higher incidence of burst suppression identified by analysis of the raw EEG in the delirium group than in the no delirium group (73.45% vs. 50.9%; P=0.001) which appeared to be driven largely by a higher incidence of burst suppression during maintenance of anesthesia (67.2% vs. 46.3%; P=0.004). Burst suppression was more strongly associated with delirium than with age; estimated linear regression coefficient for burst suppression 0.182 (SE: 0.057; P=0.002) and for age 0.009 (SE: 0.005; P=0.082). There was no significant interaction between burst suppression and age (-0.512; SE: 0.390; P=0.190). Compared with visual detection of burst suppression, the burst suppression ratio overestimated burst suppression at low values, and underestimated burst suppression at high values. Intraoperative burst suppression identified by visual analysis of the EEG was more strongly associated with delirium than age in older adults undergoing spine surgery.

Nonetheless, the practical utility of these data for clinical and research applications, such as sleep analysis, is hindered by their noisy, large-scale, and multidimensional characteristics. Here, we develop a neural network algorithm that predicts sleep stages by tracking topological features (TFs) of wearable data and model-driven clock proxies (CPs) reflecting the circadian propensity for sleep. To evaluate its accuracy, we apply it to motion and heart rate data from the Apple Watch worn by young subjects undergoing polysomnography (PSG) and compare the predicted sleep stages with the corresponding ground truth PSG records. The neural network that includes TFs and CPs along with raw wearable data as inputs shows improved performance in classifying Wake/REM/NREM sleep. For example, it shows significant improvements in identifying REM and NREM sleep (AUROC/AUPRC improvements >13% and REM/NREM accuracy improvement of 12%) compared with the neural network using only raw data inputs. We find that this improvement is mainly attributed to the heart rate TFs. To further validate our algorithm on a different population, we test it on elderly subjects from the Multi-ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis cohort. This confirms that TFs and CPs contribute to the improvements in Wake/REM/NREM classification. We next compare the performance of our algorithm with previous state-of-the-art wearable-based sleep scoring algorithms and find that our algorithm outperforms them within and across different populations.

The purpose of this study was to assess the impact of age on mortality and complication rates in patients with STEMI-related CS randomized to standard care or mAFP on top of standard care. This is a secondary analysis of the Danish-German Cardiogenic Shock (DanGer Shock) trial, an international, multicenter, open-label trial, in which 355 adult patients with STEMI-related CS were randomized to receive an mAFP (Impella CP) plus standard care or standard care alone. The primary outcome of 180-day all-cause mortality is analyzed according to age and intervention. From lowest to highest age quartile, the median ages (range) were 54 years (Q1-Q3: 31-59 years), 65 years (Q1-Q3: 60-69 years), 73 years (Q1-Q3: 70-76 years), and 81 years (Q1-Q3: 77-92 years). There were no differences in blood pressure, lactate level, left ventricular ejection fraction, or shock severity at randomization across age groups. Mortality increased from lowest to highest quartile (31%, 47%, 61%, and 73%, respectively; log-rank P < 0.001), with an adjusted OR for death at 180 days of 7.85 (95% CI: 3.37-19.2; P < 0.001) in the highest quartile compared to the lowest. The predicted risk of mortality was higher in the standard-care group until approximately 77 years, after which the predicted risk became higher in the mAFP group (P = 0.20). In patients <77 years, a reduced 180-day mortality was observed in patients randomized to the mAFP (OR: 0.45; 95% CI: 0.28-0.73; P = 0.001), opposed to patients aged ≥77 years (OR: 1.52; 95% CI: 0.57-4.08; P = 0.40), P for interaction = 0.028. Complications were more frequent in the mAFP group, but there were no apparent differences in incidence of complications across all ages. This exploratory secondary analysis of the DanGer Shock trial demonstrates that older patients with STEMI-related CS experience high mortality and may not attain the same benefit from routine treatment with an mAFP as younger patients. Incorporating age as a factor in patient selection may enhance the overall benefit of this therapy.

However, accessible in vitro 3D dynamic models for evaluating Tumor Infiltrating Natural Killer Cells (TINKs) remain scarce. This study addresses this gap by developing a novel pump-free microfluidic chip to investigate the interactions between NK-92 cells and prostate DU 145 tumor spheroids. The platform facilitates the separation of free NKs and TINKs for subtype characterization. The design integrates multiple planes with a multi-layer paper scaffold to accommodate tumor spheroids, allowing NK-92 cells to traverse Matrigel-coated barriers that mimic the extracellular matrix. The dual-channel pump-free device enables unidirectional circulation of NK-92 cells, allowing analysis of tumor spheroid movement and NK-92 cell interactions under flow conditions. Results demonstrate continuous fluid circulation in the dual-channel device by rocking the platform at tilt angles of 21° and 15°. Tumor spheroids show- enhanced migration under flow conditions compared to static culture. Although spheroids recruit slightly more NK-92 cells under flow conditions, CD56 and CD16 receptor expression on IL-2-activated free NK-92 cells and tumor-infiltrating NK-92 cells matches in vivo patterns in dynamic cultures. These findings suggest that tumor cells and fluid dynamics significantly influence NK cell subtypes. This pump-free microfluidic platform is a functional tool for simulating and studying immune cell-tumor interactions, providing valuable insights into NK cell dynamics with tumor spheroids in physiologically relevant environments.",,,keliyanust@163.com.

We conducted a scoping review of studies published between 2013 and 2023 and indexed in PubMed, in which data related to sDHT human factors, human-centered design, and usability were reported. Following a systematic screening process, we extracted the study design, participant sample, the sDHT or sDHTs used, the methods of data capture, and the types of usability-related data captured. Our literature search returned 442 papers, of which 85 papers were found to be eligible and 83 papers were available for data extraction and not under embargo. In total, 164 sDHTs were evaluated; 141 (86%) sDHTs were wearable tools while the remaining 23 (14%) sDHTs were ambient tools. The majority of studies (55/83, 66%) reported summative evaluations of final-design sDHTs. Almost all studies (82/83, 99%) captured data from targeted end users, but only 18 (22%) out of 83 studies captured data from additional users such as care partners or clinicians. User satisfaction and ease of use were evaluated for 83% (136/164) and 91% (150/164) of sDHTs, respectively; however, learnability, efficiency, and memorability were reported for only 11 (7%), 4 (2%), and 2 (1%) out of 164 sDHTs, respectively. A total of 14 (9%) out of 164 sDHTs were evaluated according to the extent to which users were able to understand the clinical data or other information presented to them (understandability) or the actions or tasks they should complete in response (actionability). Notable gaps in reporting included the absence of a sample size rationale (reported for 21/83, 25% of all studies and 17/55, 31% of summative studies) and incomplete sociodemographic descriptive data (complete age, sex/gender, and race/ethnicity reported for 14/83, 17% of studies). Based on our findings, we suggest four actionable recommendations for future studies that will help to advance the implementation of sDHTs: (1) consider an in-depth assessment of technology usability beyond user satisfaction and ease of use, (2) expand recruitment to include important user groups such as clinicians and care partners, (3) report the rationale for key study design considerations including the sample size, and (4) provide rich descriptive statistics regarding the study sample to allow a complete understanding of generalizability to other patient populations and contexts of use.",Cobb B; Centra J; Izmailova E; Manyakov NV; McClenahan S; Patel S; Vairavan S; Vrijens B; Bakker JP; ,Healthcare Innovations Delivery; AARDEX Group; Digital Medicine Society; Koneksa Health; Johnson & Johnson Innovative Medicine; Data Science and Digital Health; See Acknowledgements,
39545768,AAPM task group report 314: Fault recovery in external beam radiation therapy.,2025-01-06,Medical physics,10.1002/mp.17502,"Task Group (TG) 314 of the American Association of Physicists in Medicine (AAPM) was charged to develop guidance for recovering from fault states in radiation therapy, specifically regarding the delivery of photon or electron beams using a linear accelerator (linac) including ancillary systems. The fault conditions addressed may involve software, hardware, or a combination of causes. The report provides detailed recommendations for the proactive steps to be taken before a fault, the actions to be taken at the time of a fault, and the safety steps before returning a linac to clinical service, as well as the activities that device manufacturers and standard organizations can do to prevent and resolve the faults. A user-maintained log of prior faults; establishment of remote access by the vendor; and user training in emergency gantry, couch, and door motions are all useful proactive steps. At the moment of downtime and after ensuring the safety of the patient, the report stresses the importance of capturing fault information, prompt contact with the service engineer after the initial assessment, and considerations for communicating the estimated duration before the linac is returned to service. The medical physicist has a critical responsibility to assess the impact of the fault on patient care. Before resuming clinical use, the medical physicist must both determine the level of testing required to ensure safe operation of the linac and ensure any partially or totally delivered treatments have been correctly saved for accurate completion of the treatment fraction. The report stresses the roles of the radiation therapist, medical physicist, and service engineer to efficiently and safely address linac downtime. The appendices contain a description of the efforts of several organizations regarding linac safety: Integrating the Healthcare Enterprise-Radiation Oncology, International Standards Organization/International Electrotechnical Commission, Radiation Oncology Safety Stakeholder Initiative, and the AAPM Vendor Relations and Product Usability Subcommittee.

We note that the sites of earliest brain damage in Parkinson's disease (PD) house the neural pace-makers of respiration. We therefore hypothesized that ongoing long-term temporal dynamics of respiration may be altered in PD. We applied a wearable device that precisely logs nasal airflow over time in 28 PD patients (mostly H&Y stage-II) and 33 matched healthy controls. Each participant wore the device for 24 h of otherwise routine daily living. We observe significantly altered temporal patterns of nasal airflow in PD, where inhalations are longer and less variable than in matched controls (mean PD = -1.22 ± 1.9 (combined respiratory features score), Control = 1.04 ± 2.16, Wilcoxon rank-sum test, z = -4.1, effect size Cliff's δ = -0.61, 95% confidence interval = -0.79 - (-0.34), P = 4.3 × 10 We conclude that breathing patterns are altered by H&Y stage-II in the disease cascade, and our methods may be further refined in the future to provide an indication with diagnostic and prognostic value. In its earliest stages, Parkinson’s disease damages the parts of the brain that control breathing. We built a small device that measures airflow patterns through the nose over time. People with Parkinson’s disease and healthy individuals wore this device for 24 h. We found that nasal inhalations in Parkinson’s patients were longer and less variable than in healthy individuals. This difference was so pronounced that, using only 30 min of recording, we could accurately determine most people who had Parkinson’s disease and how severe their disease was. Future studies will determine whether this tool can contribute to early diagnosis, and it may be useful to monitor disease progression.",,,michal.andelman-gur@weizmann.ac.il.

This study aims to evaluate associations between industry-sponsored meal payments to physicians and their prescribing patterns for sacubitril/valsartan in the USA. Using the publicly accessible Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Medicare Part D database and the Open Payments Database, this study assessed associations between industry-sponsored meal payments to physician prescribers and total amounts of Medicare claims and spending for sacubitril/valsartan between 2015 and 2021. Among 220 147 eligible physician prescribers, 60 568 (27.5%) received at least one meal payment related to sacubitril/valsartan from the manufacturer, totaling US$13.9 million. The receipt of meal payments was significantly associated with a higher proportion of sacubitril/valsartan prescriptions to all sacubitril/valsartan, angiotensin receptor blocker and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor prescriptions, with an OR of 2.04 (95% CI: 1.98 to 2.10, p<0.001). Moreover, a 10% increase in the annual number of meal payments was associated with a 2.6% (95% CI: 2.5% to 2.6%, p<0.001) increase in the annual number of Medicare claims and a 7.3% (95% CI: 7.1% to 7.5%, p<0.001) increase in annual Medicare spending per physician. Given the underprescription of sacubitril/valsartan in the USA, the positive associations between meal payments and physicians' prescribing patterns suggest that industry-sponsored meals may contribute to the early adoption of this cost-effective, novel heart failure drug among US Medicare beneficiaries.",,,anju.murayama.s8@dc.tohoku.ac.jp.

An ideal wound dressing for DFU should possess the ability of adsorbing high contents of exudate and actively promote wound healing. Here, we introduced the calcium alginate sulfate as a new biomaterial appropriate for use in wound dressing to promote the healing of full-thickness ulcers in a diabetic mouse model. In this regard, alginate sulfate (Alg-S) solutions with different degrees of substitution (DS) of 0.2, 0.5, and 0.9 were synthesized, freeze-dried, crosslinked by calcium cations, purified by washing and refreeze-dried. Primary analyses including swelling ratio, porosity content and mechanical properties revealed that all Alg-S scaffolds possess necessities for use as a wound dressing. After confirming the cytocompatibility of both alginate and alginate sulfate-based scaffolds by MTT assay, they were used as wound dressing for healing of full-thickness ulcers in diabetic mice. The results of wound healing process confirmed that calcium alginate sulfate scaffolds can heal the wounds faster than both alginate-treated and non-treated wounds. Furthermore, the histological analyses of healed tissues reveled normal regeneration of the skin tissue layers and collagen deposition similar to the healthy tissue.",Zare-Gachi M,Zharfandishan Fanavar Zistbaspar (ZFZ) Chemical Company,h.daemi@ippi.ac.ir.

However, challenges such as low toughness and limited osteoinductivity hinder its widespread use in bone fixation. This study focuses on enhancing the toughness and osteogenic activity of PLLA-based orthopedic implants. Inspired by reinforcement techniques in the construction industry, we designed a structure comprising flexible fibers enveloped by PLLA/hydroxyapatite (HA) crystalline phases. Initially, PLLA/poly (butylene succinate-co-adipate) (PBSA)/HA composites with ""sea-island"" morphology were prepared through melt-compounding. Subsequently, the highly oriented PBSA fibers were in situ formed during microinjection molding for bone screw fabrication. Comprehensive investigation into the structural-mechanical property relationship revealed a significant increase in elongation at break (from 5.4 % to 59.4 % with an optimal PBSA/HA ratio), while maintaining a high stiffness and a slight decrease in tensile strength (from 62.0 MPa to 56.0 MPa). The flexural tests of the resulting composite bone screws demonstrated a significant increase in toughness. Additionally, the in vivo studies corroborated the osteogenic potential of the microinjection molded bone screws by using hematoxylin and eosin (HE) and Masson staining. The methodology presented in this study offers a promising approach for advancing PLLA-based fixation devices in bone repair applications.",,,litao1023@wchscu.cn.

A major cause is that CGM systems are not standardized; they use various algorithms and calibration methods, leading to discordant CGM readings across systems. This discordance can be addressed by standardizing CGM performance assessments: If manufacturers aim their CGM systems at the same target, then CGM readings will align across systems. This standardization should include the comparator device, sample origin, and study procedures. With better aligned CGM readings, CGM-derived metrics will subsequently also align better between systems.",Eichenlaub M,Institut für Diabetes-Technologie,

The study included 15 patients lacking posterior mandibular teeth. Each participant received two implants in the mandibular edentulous area at the lower posterior region. The implants on the right side were categorized into three groups: Group A (650 nm laser), Group B (976 nm laser), and Group C with L-PRF (10 implants each). The left side served as the control. L-PRF was applied at the implant base before placement. Laser irradiation was performed on the buccal and lingual sides of the implants. Osseointegration was assessed using the AnyCheck system from Neo-Biotic Company. The Implant Stability Quotient (ISQ), ranging from 0-100, was measured post-operatively and after three months. There was a significant increase in stability after three months, particularly with 650 nm laser photobiomodulation followed by L-PRF application. The differences in ISQ among the three groups were statistically significant. After three months, implant stability was significantly higher both buccally and lingually in Group A, using powers of 75 mW and 100 mW, respectively, compared to the control (",,,
39537722,Passive shoulder occupational exoskeleton reduces shoulder muscle coactivation in repetitive arm movements.,2024-11-13,Scientific reports,10.1038/s41598-024-78090-2,"Humans naturally employ muscle coactivation to facilitate a broad range of movements, enhancing joint stability and movement accuracy. However, excessive muscle coactivation can become unfavorable or even detrimental. This phenomenon is often observed in industrial workers who endure repetitive or prolonged joint stress, particularly in areas such as the shoulders. Prolonged stress can result in soft tissue damage and the onset of work-related musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs). In recent years, there have been efforts to mitigate the emergence of work-related MSDs among industrial workers through the implementation of upper-limb occupational exoskeletons (OEs). While previous research has demonstrated their effectiveness in reducing shoulder muscle activation, particularly in static and overhead work activities, there has been a lack of studies examining the impact of upper-limb OEs on muscle coactivation during repetitive arm movements. To bridge this gap in knowledge, our study systematically assesses the influence of a passive exoskeleton's anti-gravitational support on shoulder muscle coactivation during repetitive arm movements. Results show that peak and mean coactivation levels linearly decrease with the increase of the amount of anti-gravitational support provided by the upper-limb OE, reaching approximately 51% and 54%, respectively. Conversely, the percentage of the movement cycle corresponding to the coactivation peak appears unaffected by the level of assistance. This study marks the first instance in which a passive upper-limb OE has been shown to reduce shoulder muscle coactivations, potentially paving the way for a novel methodology in their evaluation.",Giovacchini F,IUVO S.R.L.,lorenzo.grazi@santannapisa.it.

Cardiovascular interventions,10.1016/j.jcin.2024.08.046,"Aortic stenosis (AS) affects about 12% of people aged ≥75 years. Accumulating evidence on the prognostic importance of cardiac damage in patients with asymptomatic and less than severe AS supports the proposition of advancing aortic valve replacement (AVR) to earlier disease stages. Potential benefits of earlier treatment, including prevention of cardiac damage progression and reduced cardiovascular hospitalizations, need to be balanced against the earlier procedural risk and subsequent lifetime management after AVR. Two small, randomized trials indicate that early surgical AVR may improve survival in patients with asymptomatic severe AS, and observational data suggest that AVR may reduce mortality even in patients with moderate AS. A clear understanding of the pathophysiology of cardiac damage secondary to AS is needed to develop strategies to select patients for earlier AVR. Noninvasive imaging can detect early cardiac damage, and indices such as fibrosis, global longitudinal strain, and myocardial work index have potential use to guide stratification of patients for earlier AVR. Ongoing randomized trials are investigating the safety and efficacy of AVR for patients with asymptomatic severe AS and those with moderate AS who have symptoms/evidence of cardiac damage. Pathophysiological considerations and accumulating evidence from clinical studies that support earlier timing of AVR for AS will need to be corroborated by the results of these trials. This review aims to evaluate the evidence for earlier AVR, discuss strategies to guide stratification of patients who may benefit from this approach, highlight the relevant ongoing randomized trials, and consider the consequences of earlier intervention.",,,thomas.pilgrim@insel.ch.
39537208,Network-based hub biomarker discovery for glaucoma.,2024-11-13,BMJ open ophthalmology,10.1136/bmjophth-2024-001915,"Glaucoma is an optic neuropathy and the leading cause of irreversible blindness worldwide. However, the early detection of glaucoma remains challenging, as chronic forms of glaucoma remain largely asymptomatic until considerable irreversible visual field deficits have ensued. Thus, biomarkers that facilitate early diagnosis and treatment for glaucoma patients with a high risk of progression are pressing. Human disease-biomarker interactions network and human disease-target-drug interactions network were first constructed based on multiomics data. The greedy search algorithm was used to search for the hub biomarkers and drug targets for glaucoma. Genome-wide association studies and epidemiological data from the UK Biobank were used to verify our results. Biological network and functional analysis was conducted to find common network features and pathways. We identified 10 hub biomarkers/drug targets for the diagnosis, treatment and prognosis for glaucoma. These results were verified by text mining and genomic/epidemiology data. We also predicted the new application of BMP1 and MMP9 to diagnose glaucoma and confirm the theory of hub biomarkers with multiple clinical applications. Further, relevant pivotal pathways for these hub biomolecules were discovered, which may serve as foundations for future biomarker and drug target prediction for glaucoma. We have used a network-based approach to identify hub diagnostic and therapeutic biomarkers for glaucoma and detected relationships between glaucoma and associated diseases. Several hub biomarkers were identified and verified, which may play more important roles in the diagnosis and treatment of glaucoma.",,,zhangxueli@gdph.org.cn
39536843,Impact of preoperative risk factors on 5-year survival after fenestrated/branched endovascular aortic repair.,2025-04-26,Journal of vascular surgery,10.1016/j.jvs.2024.11.002,"To investigate which preoperative factors most impact the 5-year survival of patients undergoing fenestrated/branched endovascular aortic repair (F/BEVAR) and to identify modifiable elements that, if time allows, should be actively managed and adequately controlled preoperatively. Patients treated for aortic aneurysms with complex anatomy using either patient-specific company-manufactured or off-the-shelf F/BEVAR devices were included. The exposure of interest was aneurysm type (group I: type I-III thoracoabdominal aneurysms vs group II: type IV thoracoabdominal aneurysms vs group III: juxtarenal or suprarenal aneurysms), and the primary outcome was 5-year risk of all-cause mortality. Generalized linear models were used to estimate each group's crude 5-year risk of death and the 5-year risk of death across groups. Each preoperative factor was added to the model individually, and a change in estimate was calculated between the new risks and the crude risk. Preoperative factors with a change of estimate of ≥10% were used to create an inverse probability of treatment weights for multivariable analysis. A total of 408 F/BEVAR patients were included, of whom 71.6% were male (mean age: 72.0 ± 7.9 years). Eleven of the 22 preoperative factors analyzed had a change in estimate ≥10%. The greatest changes in estimates were observed for history of congestive heart failure (CHF), arrhythmia, overweight, obesity, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Almost 60% of patients with CHF in group I died within 5 years. Current smoking or overweight at the time of F/BEVAR increases the 5-year risk of death more significantly than having a history of myocardial infarction. After adjustment, patients in group I had a significantly higher risk of 5-year all-cause mortality than those in group III (log-rank, P value = .0082). The present findings suggest that cardiac arrhythmias, CHF, overweight, obesity, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and aneurysm diameter above 7 cm are the most relevant preoperative factors that impact the 5-year survival after F/BEVAR. More specifically, CHF and arrhythmias should be used to alter patient selection and identify those individuals more likely to benefit from repair. Moreover, modifiable risk factors such as weight loss and smoking cessation during the surveillance period before the F/BEVAR procedure might improve survival in this population. Considering that, preoperatively, many patients are periodically evaluated by a vascular surgery team until the aneurysm diameter meets criteria for repair, a multidisciplinary approach that could address these modifiable risk factors might be an impactful strategy.",,,mark_farber@med.unc.edu.

39535297,Tranexamic acid for preventing postpartum haemorrhage after caesarean section.,2024-11-13,The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,10.1002/14651858.CD016278,"Postpartum haemorrhage (PPH) is common and potentially life-threatening. The antifibrinolytic drug tranexamic acid (TXA) is recommended for treating PPH; it reduces the risk of death from haemorrhage by one-third when given soon after bleeding onset, but not overall risk of death. Interest in whether TXA may be effective in preventing PPH is growing. Evidence indicates that TXA given more than three hours after injury to bleeding trauma patients increases mortality. Potential harm becomes critical in prophylactic use of TXA. Reliable evidence of the effect and safety profile of TXA is required before widespread prophylactic use can be considered. To assess the effects of TXA for preventing PPH compared to placebo or no treatment (with or without uterotonic co-treatment) in women during caesarean birth. We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and WHO ICTRP to 20 February 2024 and searched reference lists of retrieved studies. We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating the use of TXA alone or plus uterotonics during caesarean birth for preventing PPH. Trials needed to be prospectively registered (i.e. before starting recruitment). We applied a trustworthiness checklist. The critical outcome was blood loss ≥ 1000 mL, measured using estimated or calculated methods. Important outcomes included maternal death, severe morbidity, blood transfusion, the use of additional surgical interventions to control PPH, thromboembolic events, use of additional uterotonics, hysterectomy, maternal satisfaction, and breastfeeding at discharge. We assessed risk of bias in the included studies using Cochrane's RoB 1 tool. Two review authors independently selected trials, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias and trial trustworthiness. We pooled data using random-effects meta-analysis. We assessed the certainty of the evidence using GRADE. We included six RCTs with 15,981 participants. All 12 trials in the previous version of this review were not included after review of trial registrations and trustworthiness checklists. Most included studies involved women at low risk of PPH and were conducted in high-resource settings. Prophylactic TXA in addition to standard care compared to placebo in addition to standard care or standard care alone TXA results in little to no difference in estimated blood loss ≥ 1000 mL (risk ratio (RR) 0.94, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.79 to 1.11; 4 RCTs; n = 13,042; high certainty evidence), resulting in 8 fewer per 1000 women having estimated blood loss ≥ 1000 mL (from 30 fewer to 16 more). TXA likely results in a slight reduction in calculated blood loss ≥ 1000 mL (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.76 to 0.92; 2 RCTs; n = 4327; moderate certainty evidence), resulting in 53 fewer per 1000 having calculated blood loss ≥ 1000 mL (from 75 fewer to 25 fewer). The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of TXA on maternal death (one event in placebo group, none in TXA group). No trials measured severe morbidity. TXA likely results in little to no difference in blood transfusion (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.08; 5 RCTs; n = 15,740; moderate certainty evidence), resulting in 4 fewer per 1000 women requiring a blood transfusion (from 10 fewer to 3 more). TXA results in little to no difference in additional surgical interventions to control PPH (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.22; 4 RCTs; n = 15,631; high certainty evidence), resulting in 1 more per 1000 women requiring additional surgical intervention (from 4 fewer to 7 more). The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of TXA on thromboembolic events (RR 1.40, 95% CI 0.22 to 8.90; 4 RCTs; n = 14,480; very low certainty evidence), resulting in 1 more per 1000 women having a thromboembolic event (from 2 fewer to 17 more). TXA results in little to no difference in the need for additional uterotonics (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.00; 4 RCTs; n = 15,728; high certainty evidence), resulting in 15 fewer per 1000 women requiring additional uterotonics (from 27 fewer to 0 fewer). The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of TXA on hysterectomy (RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.20 to 3.29; 2 RCTs; n = 4546; very low certainty evidence), resulting in 3 fewer per 10,000 women requiring a hysterectomy (from 11 fewer to 31 more). One trial measuring maternal satisfaction reported no difference between groups at day two postpartum. No data were available on breastfeeding. Overall, studies had low risk of bias. We downgraded the certainty of evidence mainly for imprecision. Prophylactic TXA in addition to standard care during caesarean birth results in little to no difference in estimated blood loss ≥ 1000 mL and likely results in a slight reduction in calculated blood loss ≥ 1000 mL compared to placebo. There were no data for severe morbidity due to PPH. Event rates for further interventions to control PPH were low and similar across groups. Prophylactic TXA thus results in little to no difference between groups for additional surgical interventions (32 versus 31 per 1000), and likely results in little to no difference between groups for blood transfusions (31 versus 36 per 1000) and use of additional uterotonics (107 versus 121 per 1000). There were very few events for the outcomes maternal death (1 in placebo group), thromboembolic events (2 versus 3 per 1000), and hysterectomy (1 per 1000 in each group). Evidence for these serious adverse events is therefore very uncertain. Decisions about implementing routine prophylactic TXA during caesarean birth should not only consider outcomes related to blood loss, but also the relatively low rates of PPH morbidity and uncertainty of serious adverse events. Most studies included women at low risk of PPH, thereby precluding any conclusions about women at high risk of PPH. Cost associated with routine use of an additional drug for all caesarean births needs to be considered. This Cochrane review was funded in part by the World Health Organization.

39531466,Budget impact analysis of subcutaneous infliximab (CT-P13 SC) for treating inflammatory bowel disease in Saudi Arabia: Analysis from payer perspective.,2024-11-12,PloS one,10.1371/journal.pone.0312603,"The Saudi Food and Drug Authority (SFDA) has approved the subcutaneous (SC) administration of infliximab, presenting a more convenient alternative with reduced outpatient visits and diminished expenses compared to the intravenous (IV) administration. However, the financial implications of this formulation have not been examined from the perspective of Saudi payers. A prevalence-based budget impact model was developed to evaluate the financial effects of introducing ""environment without"" versus ""with infliximab SC."" The model's time horizon spanned over 2 years (2021-2023), aligning with the biennial national pharmaceutical procurement cycle. The comparison focused on infliximab SC versus all available formulations of infliximab IV in the Saudi market for two inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD): Ulcerative Colitis (UC) and Crohn's Disease (CD). Treatment comparators' comparability and dose escalations were substantiated by published studies, utilizing dosing information from the summary of product characteristics. Drug acquisition costs were derived from SFDA registered prices, with IV formulation administration costs included. Scenario analysis assessed the budget impact of infliximab SC introduction at uptake rates ranging from 0% to 100%. Introducing infliximab SC demonstrated cost-saving potential in the treatment of IBD. At 100% uptake with UC patients for 2 years, infliximab SC resulted in savings of -SAR-31.9 million (-SAR29,145 per patient). Similarly, for CD, introducing infliximab SC at 100% uptake over 2 years yielded savings of -SAR106.2 million (-SAR36,585 per patient). This study reveals that infliximab SC is associated with cost-saving potential when compared to infliximab IV formulations available in Saudi Arabia. Future research should address uncertainties related to real-world comparative effectiveness, the convenience of administration, patient tolerability, and physician acceptance of the SC formulation of infliximab, alongside comparisons with other TNF-alpha inhibitors.",Almutairi AR,Drug Sector,

The situation with the dominant share of imported medical products in the Russian market highlights the dependence on international supplies and technologies in the healthcare sector. The policies and sanctions imposed by the European Union and other countries regarding the supply of medical equipment to Russia cause certain restrictions and difficulties due to the current political situation. Although these goods are classified as vital and do not fall under sanctions, many companies from Europe and the United States have suspended deliveries due to the so-called «moral embargo». Lack of access to modern equipment and medicines can lead to a deterioration in the quality of medical care, an increase in waiting times for treatment, as well as possible complications and a deterioration in the prognosis of the disease in patients. The article analyzes the dynamics of the medical products market over the past few years, and identifies changes in the structure of the medical devices market. The share in the import of medical equipment to Russia was also studied. In addition, the prospects for the development of the medical industry are considered and the current situation is assessed.

Patients from the Women's International Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation (WIN-TAVI) registry were categorized according to baseline LVEF into 3 groups: reduced (LVEF ≤40%), mildly reduced (LVEF between 41% and 49%), and preserved (LVEF ≥50%) LVEF. The primary (Valve Academic Research Consortium 2 [VARC-2]) efficacy point was defined as a composite of mortality, stroke, myocardial infarction, hospitalization for valve-related symptoms or heart failure, or valve-related dysfunction at 1 year. The primary (VARC-2) safety end point included all-cause mortality, stroke, major vascular complication, life-threatening bleeding, stage 2 to 3 acute kidney injury, coronary artery obstruction requiring intervention, or valve-related dysfunction requiring repeated procedures. A Cox regression model was performed using the preserved LVEF group as the reference. Among the 944 patients included, 764 (80.9%) exhibited preserved, 80 (8.5%) had mildly reduced, and 100 (10.6%) had reduced LVEF. The 1-year incidence of VARC-2 efficacy end point was numerically higher in patients with reduced LVEF, albeit not resulting in a significant risk difference. Notably, reduced LVEF was associated with a higher risk of the 1-year VARC-2 safety end point, still significant after adjustment (28.0% vs 19.6%, Hazard Ratio 1.78, 95% Confidence Interval 1.12- 2.82, p = 0.014). These differences were primarily driven by trends toward increased rates of all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, and major vascular complications. Clinical outcomes were similar between patients with mildly reduced and preserved LVEF. In conclusion, when performed in women with reduced LVEF, TAVI was associated with a worse (VARC-2) safety profile at 1-year follow-up. In contrast, patients with mildly reduced LVEF appeared to align more closely with outcomes observed in the preserved LVEF group than with the reduced LVEF group.",Tchetche D; Iadanza A; Dumonteil N; Trabattoni D; Naber C,Department of Cardiology; Department of Invasive Cardiology,roxana.mehran@mountsinai.org.

The task consisted in the cannulation of the gate of a GORE Excluder AAA endoprosthesis bifurcated aortic stent graft (W.L. GORE & Associates) deployed into a three-dimensional printed abdominal aortic aneurysm model connected to a 7000 MDX flow pump (Sarns Inc/3M) reproducing physiological conditions. The procedure was performed in a hybrid operating room (GE Allia IGS 7). Each participant performed the cannulation task with fluoroscopy, standard IOPS guidance with flat screen display (IOPS-FS), and the investigational IOPS with augmented reality headset (IOPS-AR), in a randomly assigned order. All participants used the same sensorized guidewire and steerable 6Fr catheter during their three cannulation tasks. A total of 26 participants were classified in three groups of experience: Group 1 (endovascular naïve; n = 13), Group 2 (surgeon in training; n = 12) and Group 3 (one expert surgeon). Primary endpoints included cannulation time and technical success, which was defined as the advancement of the catheter over the guidewire within the main body of the aortic stent graft within a maximum 15-minute cutoff time for each trial. In group 1, the mean cannulation time was shorter using IOPS-AR vs fluoroscopy (4.3 ± 4.4 vs 7.1 ± 4.9 minutes; P = .04), but not statistically different when comparing IOPS-FS and fluoroscopy (6.3 ± 4.5 vs 7.1 ± 4.9 minutes; P = .63). In group 1, technical success was 77% with fluoroscopy and 92% with both IOPS-FS and IOPS-AR (P = .59). In group 2, although there was no significant difference between cannulation time among the three different endovascular approaches, there was a trend towards shorter cannulation times with IOPS-FS or IOPS-AR as compared with fluoroscopy (mean time of 2.5 ± 0.9, 4.4 ± 4.0, and 5.2 ± 4.5 minutes, respectively). In group 2, technical success was 92% with fluoroscopy and 100% with both IOPS-FS and IOPS-AR (P > .99). The expert vascular surgeon repeated the cannulation task four times for each endovascular approach, with 100% technical success and no difference in mean cannulation time between the imaging modalities (P = .89). Augmented reality allows for reducing the gate cannulation time as compared with fluoroscopy in participants with no previous exposure to any endovascular procedure. This suggests that augmented reality can be beneficial for individuals early in their career and can mitigate the learning curve. As individuals become experts, their ability to adapt to different endovascular modalities increases, eliminating the learning curve altogether.",,,gustavo.oderich@uth.tmc.edu.

However, many patients face significant challenges in maintaining these results. Personalized interventions, including behavioral counseling and physical activity, have been shown to improve long-term adherence and success. Current clinical guidelines emphasize the pivotal role of dietitians in enhancing patient outcomes through nutritional therapy. When combined with pharmacotherapy and bariatric surgery, the focus shifts from mere weight loss to broader health improvements. This review explores the evolving role of dietitians in obesity management, advocating for a shift from a weight-centric approach to a more holistic model that prioritizes overall health gains. Key areas of interest include dietetic interventions' impact on metabolic health, cardiovascular function, gut microbiome balance, inflammation, and psychological well-being. Dietetic interventions have been shown to provide significant health improvements beyond weight loss. These include enhanced metabolic and cardiovascular health, better gut microbiome balance, reduced inflammation, improved sleep quality, mental well-being, and overall quality of life. By focusing on non-scale victories such as improved insulin sensitivity, lipid profiles, and mental health, dietitians play a crucial role in driving long-term success in obesity management. These outcomes highlight the need to shift the focus from short-term weight loss to a more comprehensive view of health gains. The role of dietitians in obesity management is expanding to encompass a more comprehensive and individualized approach. Moving beyond a focus on weight reduction, this paradigm promotes long-term, patient-centered strategies that address the multifactorial nature of obesity. By combining dietary changes with regular physical activity and behavioral support, dietitians can contribute to sustained health improvements, treating obesity as a chronic, complex disease.",,,

However, the poor mechanical properties of this material have limited its application in the field of tissue engineering. The purpose of this study was to fabricate a scaffold with suitable mechanical properties and in vitro cell responses for soft tissue by using poly(HEMA-co-MMA) with various concentration ratios of hydroxyethyl methacrylate (HEMA) and methyl methacrylate (MMA). To customize the concentration ratio of HEMA and MMA, the characteristics of the fabricated scaffold with various concentration ratios were investigated through structural morphology, FT-IR, mechanical property, and contact angle analyses. Moreover, in vitro cell responses were observed according to the various concentration ratios of HEMA and MMA. Consequently, various morphologies and pore sizes were observed by changing the HEMA and MMA ratio. The mechanical properties and contact angle of the fabricated scaffolds were measured according to the HEMA and MMA concentration ratio. The results were as follows: compressive maximum stress: 254.24-932.42 KPa; tensile maximum stress: 4.37-30.64 KPa; compressive modulus: 16.14-38.80 KPa; tensile modulus: 0.5-2 KPa; and contact angle: 36.89-74.74°.

We introduce the convolutional block attention module (CBAM) to bolster the model's sensitivity to key features, thereby enhancing detection accuracy. To address potential performance degradation issues associated with the complete intersection over union (CIoU) loss function in the original model, we implement the modified penalty-decay intersection over union (MPDIoU) loss function to achieve more stable and precise bounding box regression. Furthermore, considering the original YOLOv5s model's large parameter count, we adopt a lightweight design using the MobileNetV3 architecture and replace the original squeeze-and-excitation (SE) attention mechanism with CBAM, significantly reducing computational complexity.

The purpose of this study was to measure differences in MT strain between conditions in which the lower back muscles were relaxed versus maximally activated. Ten participants without low back pain were tested. A matrix of six MTs was placed on the lower back, and strain data were captured under a series of conditions. The first condition was a baseline trial, in which participants lay prone and the muscles of the lower back were relaxed. The subsequent trials were maximum voluntary isometric contractions (MVICs), in which participants did not move, but resisted the examiner force in extension or rotational directions to maximally engage their lower back muscles. The mean MT strain was calculated for each condition. A repeated measures ANOVA was conducted to analyze the effects of conditions (baseline, extension, right rotation, and left rotation) and MT position (1-6) on the MT strain. Post hoc analyses were conducted for significant effects from the overall analysis.

However, due to the inherently nonlinear and ill-posed characteristics of MWT calculations, actual imaging is prone to overfitting or artifacts. To address this, this paper proposes a two-step iterative imaging approach for rapid medical microwave tomography. This method establishes corresponding objective functions for microwave imaging across multiple frequencies and conducts iterative calculations on images at varying resolutions. This effectively enhances image clarity and accuracy while alleviating the issue of prolonged computational time associated with imaging complex structures at high resolution due to insufficient prior information during iterative processes. In the electromagnetic simulation section, we simulated a three-layer brain model and conducted imaging experiments. The results demonstrate that the algorithm significantly enhances imaging resolution, accurately pinpointing cerebral hemorrhages at different locations using an eight-antenna array and successfully reconstructs tomography images with a hemorrhage area radius of 1 cm.

This study employs Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (cGANs) to create synthetic kinematic data from a publicly available dataset, closely mimicking the experimentally measured reaching movements of stroke survivors. This approach not only captures the complex temporal dynamics and common movement patterns after stroke, but also significantly enhances the training dataset. By training deep learning models on both synthetic and experimental data, we enhanced task classification accuracy: models incorporating synthetic data attained an overall accuracy of 80.0%, significantly higher than the 66.1% seen in models trained solely with real data.

Fifteen highly trained male collegiate long-distance runners participated in a randomized, double-blind crossover study. Participants completed two 30 km runs (30k-RUN) during a 10-day training camp. After each run, they wore either magnetic (MAG) or non-magnetic control (CTRL) garments. Sleep quality and heart rate variability (HRV) were assessed using a wrist-worn device before and after each 30k-RUN. Wearing MAG garments post-30k-RUN resulted in significantly longer deep sleep duration compared to CTRL. HRV analysis revealed that the MAG condition led to a significantly higher root mean square of successive RR interval differences and high-frequency power, indicating enhanced parasympathetic activity. The low-frequency to high-frequency ratio was significantly lower in MAG than in CTRL. Perceived recovery scores were significantly higher in MAG than in CTRL. The findings of this study suggest that wearing magnetic garments following high-intensity endurance running may promote parasympathetic dominance and improve sleep quality in male long-distance runners.

This study aimed to compare two postprocessing techniques for monosodium urate (MSU) detection: conventional two-material decomposition and material map-based decomposition. A raster phantom and an ex vivo biophantom, embedded with four different MSU concentrations, were scanned in two high-end CT scanners. Scanner 1 used the conventional postprocessing method while scanner 2 employed the material map approach. Volumetric analysis was performed to determine MSU detection, and image quality parameters, such as signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR), were computed. The material map-based method demonstrated superior MSU detection. Specifically, scanner 2 yielded total MSU volumes of 5.29 ± 0.28 mL and 4.52 ± 0.29 mL (mean ± standard deviation) in the raster and biophantom, respectively, versus 2.35 ± 0.23 mL and 1.15 ± 0.17 mL for scanner 1. Radiation dose correlated positively with detection for the conventional scanner, while there was no such correlation for the material map-based decomposition method in the biophantom. Despite its higher detection rate, material map-based decomposition was inferior in terms of SNR, CNR, and artifacts. While material map-based decomposition resulted in superior MSU detection, it is limited by challenges such as increased artifacts. Our findings highlight the potential of this method for gout diagnosis while underscoring the need for further research to enhance its clinical reliability. Advanced postprocessing such as material-map-based two-material decomposition might improve the sensitivity for gouty arthritis in clinical practice, thus, allowing for lower radiation doses or better sensitivity for gouty tophi. Dual-energy CT showed limited sensitivity for tophi with low MSU concentrations. Materiel-map-based decomposition increased sensitivity compared to conventional two-material decomposition.

Electronic databases were systematically searched up to July 2024. Any studies performed in the peri-operative setting using a CGM device were included. Closed-loop systems also administering insulin were excluded. Analyses were stratified according to diabetes mellitus status and covered intra-operative and postoperative data. Outcomes included glycaemic profile (normal range 3.9 to 10.0 mmol l -1 ), complications, adverse events, and device dysfunction. Twenty-six studies (1016 patients) were included. Twenty-four studies were not randomised, and six used a control arm for comparison. In bariatric surgery, diabetes mellitus patients had a mean ± SD glucose of 5.6 ± 0.5 mmol l -1 , with 15.4 ± 8.6% time below range, 75.3 ± 5.5% in range and 9.6 ± 6.7% above range. During major surgery, diabetes mellitus patients showed a mean glucose of 9.6 ± 1.1 mmol l -1 , with 9.5 ± 9.1% of time below range, 56.3 ± 13.5% in range and 30.6 ± 13.9% above range. In comparison, nondiabetes mellitus patients had a mean glucose of 6.4 ± 0.6 mmol l -1 , with 6.7 ± 8.4% time below range, 84.6 ± 15.5% in range and 11.2 ± 4.9% above range. Peri-operative complications were reported in only one comparative study and were similar in CGM and control groups. Device-related adverse events were rare and underreported. In 9.21% of cases, the devices experienced dysfunctions such as accidental removal and issues with sensors or readers. Due to the limited number of controlled studies, the impact of CGM on postoperative glycaemic control and complications compared with point-of-care testing remains unknown. Variability in postoperative glycaemic profiles and a device dysfunction rate of 1 in 10 suggest CGM should be investigated in a targeted surgical group.",Grange E; Schorer R; Schiffer E; Gariani K,,

Achieving optimal glycemic control is crucial yet challenging, particularly with insulin therapy, where 30-50% of patients fail to meet treatment targets. Telemedicine can improve diabetes management but generates vast amounts of data, burdening healthcare professionals. Integrating clinical decision support tools into telemonitoring systems may enhance care efficiency and glycemic control. The trial is a multicenter 3-month, three-arm, open-label, randomized controlled trial. The trial aims to enroll 51 participants with type 2 diabetes on insulin therapy. Participants will be divided with a 3:1:1 ratio into telemonitoring with decision support, telemonitoring without decision support, and usual care groups. The study employs connected insulin pens, continuous glucose monitors (CGMs), and activity trackers to enable telemonitoring. Outcomes measured include CGM time in range, HbA1c, hypo- and hyperglycemia incidents, total daily insulin dose, body weight, treatment satisfaction, and adherence. Telemonitoring with decision support has the potential to revolutionize diabetes management by offering personalized treatment suggestions, thereby reducing the burden on healthcare professionals, and improving patient outcomes. This study will provide valuable insights into the effectiveness of such an approach in achieving glycemic control in people with type 2 diabetes on insulin therapy. By evaluating both clinical outcomes and patient and healthcare professionals' satisfaction, the study aims to contribute to the development of efficient, scalable telehealth solutions for diabetes care.

Human 3D-tissue models can offer valuable insights into cancer behavior and treatment efficacy. This study developed a cell phantom setup using a rattail collagen-based hydrogel to facilitate reproducible investigations into ablation techniques, focusing on electroporation (EP) for lung tumor cells. The temperature rise due to the treatment is a critical aspect based on other studies that have discovered non-neglectable temperature values. A realistic physiological, biological phantom is crucial for electrode material development, non-thermal ablation control, tumor cell behavior study, and image-guided treatment simulation. The test system comprises a standardized 3D-printed setup, a cell-mimicking hydrogel model cultivated with NIH3T3 and HCC-827 cell lines. The treatment is evaluated with an AlamarBlue assay and the temperature is monitored with a sensor and a non-invasive MR-thermometry. Results showed the reliability of the selected monitoring methods and especially the temperature monitoring displayed interesting insights. The thermal effect due to EP cannot be neglected and it has to be discussed if this technique is non-thermal. The lesions in the phantom were able to show apoptotic and necrotic regions. The EP further led to a change in viability. These results suggest that the phantom can mimic the response of soft tissue and is a useful tool for studying cellular response and damage caused by EP or other treatment techniques.",Zanasi A,IGEA Zwgn.

We sought to identify unique failure mechanisms and significant differences in the types of complications associated with ELICs as reported to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) Database. The MAUDE Database was analyzed for complication reports submitted for ELIC systems between January 2013 and July 2023. Reports were categorized by manufacturer, brand name, type of expandable cage, type of complication, year of complication, and reporter identity. Reports that were duplicated or had insufficient information were excluded from analysis. The top 5 manufacturers with the most implant-related complications were independently analyzed and compared. A total of 821 reports were analyzed. The top 5 complications reported across all manufacturers were cage breakage during insertion (25.7%), postoperative migration without collapse (16.0%), postoperative collapse (15.6%), inserter breakage (11.1%), and tubing problems (3.0%). A significant difference was detected in complication type between manufacturers ( With FDA approval of novel ELIC systems and the adoption of newer surgical techniques, understanding the range of potential complications is paramount in ensuring patient safety.

We assessed prevalence of, patient profiles and outcomes associated with COPD across the ejection fraction (EF) spectrum. HF patients enrolled in the Swedish HF registry between 2005 and 2021 were considered. Multivariable logistic regression models were fitted to assess patient characteristics independently associated with COPD and Cox regression models for investigating the associations between COPD and outcomes, that is, morbidity/mortality. Among 97 904 HF patients, COPD prevalence was 13%, highest in HF with preserved EF [HFpEF: 16%, HF with mildly reduced EF (HFmrEF): 12%, HF with reduced EF (HFrEF): 11%]. Key patient characteristics independently associated with a diagnosis of COPD included higher EF, female sex, smoking, obstructive sleep disorder, peripheral artery disease, a lower educational level, more severe HF, more likely mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist and diuretic use but less likely use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers/angiotensin-receptor-neprilysin inhibitors (not in HFrEF), beta-blockers, HF device therapies, and follow-up in HF nurse-led clinics. COPD was independently associated with a 15% higher risk of cardiovascular (CV) death/HF hospitalization [hazard ratio: 1.15 (95% confidence interval: 1.11-1.18)], CV death, non-CV death, all-cause death and HF hospitalizations, regardless of EF.

Additionally, implant superstructures not supported by the periodontal ligament and partially covered crowns were excluded. A total of 42 studies were identified. According to the studies in this review, the most common complication of porcelain-layered zirconia restorations is porcelain fracture, but the long-term prognosis is stable. However, complications of monolithic zirconia restorations include crown fractures and fractures of the abutment tooth and root, and long-term clinical evidence is not available yet. Additionally, bruxism can be a complication factor with both types of restorations, so it is important to carefully examine the oral habits, including bruxism, before treatment.

39508406,Effect of infusion line connection and infusion line characteristics on start-up fluid delivery from syringe infusion pumps used for microinfusion.,2025-01-06,Paediatric anaesthesia,10.1111/pan.15031,"Connecting an infusion line to a closed stopcock results in pressurization of fluid within the syringe infusion pump assembly leading to flow irregularities when opening the stopcock and activating the pump. It was the purpose of this study to assess the extent of pressurization under different conditions and its impact on start-up fluid delivery. Intraluminal pressures and start-up fluid delivery at 1 mL/h flow rate were assessed with connection of the infusion line 1 min (delayed connection) or immediately after purging (immediate connection) using two different infusion lines made from polyvinylchloride (PVC) or polyethylene (PE). Delayed connection resulted in an increase of intraluminal pressures from zero to 5.1 [4.5 to 5.7] mmHg with the PVC line and from zero to 47.1 [44.8 to 49.3] mmHg with the PE line (mean difference 42.0 [95% CI 39.3-44.7] mmHg; p < .0001). Immediate connection resulted in an increase of intraluminal pressures from zero to 44.3 [41.8-46.8] mmHg with the PVC line and from zero to 61.3 [57.2-65.4] mmHg with the PE line (mean difference 17.0 [95% CI 11.8-22.2] mmHg; p < .0001). The increase in intraluminal pressures was significantly higher with PE lines for both delayed and immediate connection when compared to the PVC lines (mean difference 29.5 [95% CI 19.3-39.7] mmHg; p < .0001). Related fluid volumes delivered at 10 s and 360 s after starting the pump ranged from -252% to 1321% (10 s) of expected infusion volumes and from 59% to 129% (360 s), respectively. Both, timing of infusion line connection after purging and infusion line characteristics considerably affect intraluminal pressures and start-up fluid delivery when connecting a new syringe infusion pump assembly to a closed stopcock.

A systematic review.,,Health science reports,10.1002/hsr2.70039,"Preprocedural ultrasound (PPU) reduces the risk of technical failure in non-obese patients and when technical difficulty is predicted. We conducted this review to determine if PPU improves first-pass needle insertion success for neuraxial anesthesia in patients with obesity. We conducted a systematic review without meta-analysis, due to the small number of included studies. The study protocol was registered (PROSPERO: CRD42022368271). We conducted searches in MEDLINE, Embase, PubMed, and Cochrane Library from January 1, 1980 to October 1, 2022 for peer-reviewed randomized controlled or observational studies comparing PPU versus landmark techniques in patients with body mass index >30 kg/m There were nine randomized controlled studies, comprising 866 patients having lumbo-sacral neuraxial techniques. Three studies utilized a small handheld ultrasound device called Accuro™ and six utilized non-handheld ultrasound devices. Certainty of evidence was low for improving the first-pass success rate. There was evidence (moderate certainty) that PPU decreased number of passes, increased first insertion attempt success, and reduced number of insertion attempts. There was no evidence that PPU affected identifying time, needling time, or overall procedural time. There was no evidence that PPU influenced procedural failure rate (very low certainty evidence) and insufficient evidence to suggest that artificial intelligence-supported handheld devices were superior to conventional ultrasound devices. In patients with obesity, there is evidence of very-low to moderate certainty that PPU improves markers of insertion success, with no indication of increased adverse effects. PPU should be used to reduce attempts. Further studies adhering to standardized outcome definitions are required for definitive recommendations.

We conducted a male condom HIV prevention cascade analysis using data from a general-population survey in Manicaland, Zimbabwe (July 2018-December 2019) to develop an understanding of how interventions that reduce IPV might be built upon to also reduce HIV incidence. Multivariable logistic regression was used to measure associations between currently-married HIV-negative women's experience of IPV and: (1) being in the priority population for HIV prevention methods (i.e. married women engaging in behaviours associated with HIV acquisition risk or with a spouse who engages in similar behaviours or is living with HIV), and (2) male condom use by women in this priority population. Male condom HIV prevention cascades, with explanatory barriers for gaps between successive cascade bars (motivation, access and effective use), were compared for women in the priority population reporting and not reporting IPV. We found a positive association between IPV and being in the priority population for HIV prevention methods (72.3% versus 58.5%; AOR = 2.26, 95% CI:1.74-2.93). Condom use was low (< 15%) for women in the priority population and did not differ between those reporting and not reporting IPV. The HIV prevention cascades for women reporting and not reporting IPV were similar; both showing large gaps in motivation and capacity to use male condoms effectively. Women reporting motivation and access to male condoms were more likely to report their partner being a barrier to condom use if they experienced IPV (84.8% versus 75.5%; AOR = 2.25, 95% CI:1.17-4.31). The findings of this study support the case for trials of integrated IPV/HIV prevention interventions that are tailored to improve HIV risk perception among HIV-negative married women and to make condom provision more acceptable for this group.",,,aac4002@med.cornell.edu.

Effects of 24-hour movement behaviors captured in free-living settings have received less attention. This cross-sectional study investigated associations between a 24-hour behavior composition comprising 6 parts (sleeping, sedentary behavior, standing, slow walking, fast walking, and combined exercise-like activity [eg, running and cycling]) and systolic BP (SBP) and diastolic BP (DBP). Data from thigh-worn accelerometers and BP measurements were collected from 6 cohorts in the Prospective Physical Activity, Sitting and Sleep consortium (ProPASS) (n=14 761; mean±SD, 54.2±9.6 years). Individual participant analysis using compositional data analysis was conducted with adjustments for relevant harmonized covariates. Based on the average sample composition, reallocation plots examined estimated BP reductions through behavioral replacement; the theoretical benefits of optimal (ie, clinically meaningful improvement in SBP [2 mm Hg] or DBP [1 mm Hg]) and minimal (ie, 5-minute reallocation) behavioral replacements were identified. The average 24-hour composition consisted of sleeping (7.13±1.19 hours), sedentary behavior (10.7±1.9 hours), standing (3.2±1.1 hours), slow walking (1.6±0.6 hours), fast walking (1.1±0.5 hours), and exercise-like activity (16.0±16.3 minutes). More time spent exercising or sleeping, relative to other behaviors, was associated with lower BP. An additional 5 minutes of exercise-like activity was associated with estimated reductions of -0.68 mm Hg (95% CI, -0.15, -1.21) SBP and -0.54 mm Hg (95% CI, -0.19, 0.89) DBP. Clinically meaningful improvements in SBP and DBP were estimated after 20 to 27 minutes and 10 to 15 minutes of reallocation of time in other behaviors into additional exercise. Although more time spent being sedentary was adversely associated with SBP and DBP, there was minimal impact of standing or walking.

A previous study has shown that PIS may cause intraluminal contamination. This study compared PIS-induced contamination among different types of available syringes, including disposable plastic syringes produced by several companies, glass syringes, and syringes with plastic covers. The authors found that plastic syringes caused approximately equivalent PIS-induced contamination and that glass syringes caused substantially more contamination than plastic syringes. However, syringes equipped with a plastic cover exhibited no contamination. Furthermore, disinfection with ethanol completely prevented PIS-induced contamination. This study supports the evidence that PIS may cause bacterial contamination and that a thorough aseptic technique is needed, especially when using glass syringes.

Secondary objectives tracked the type of CVAD used to acquire venous specimens and the impact on hemolysis rates or erroneous results. Considerations include exploring the benefits of utilizing the mixing method related to cost savings. In summary, the mixing versus discard method eliminates wasting blood to reduce hospital-acquired anemia as part of a PBM program. CVAD type did not influence hemolysis rates or impact erroneous results. The mixing method is easy to implement in any health care setting. Cost savings are feasible by elimination of external venous or arterial blood management protection devices.

Variable echo times neural network (VET-Net) is a two-stage framework that first estimates nonlinear variables of the CSE-MR signal model, to posteriorly estimate water/fat signal components using the least-squares method. VET-Net incorporates a vector with TEs as an auxiliary input, therefore enabling PDFF calculation with any TE setting. A single-site liver CSE-MRI dataset (188 subjects, 4146 axial slices) was considered, which was split into training (150 subjects), validation (18), and testing (20) subsets. Testing subjects were scanned using several protocols with different TEs, which we then used to measure the PDFF reproducibility coefficient (RDC) at two regions of interest (ROIs): the right posterior and left hepatic lobes. An open-source multi-site and multi-vendor fat-water phantom dataset was also used for PDFF bias assessment. VET-Net showed RDCs of 1.71% and 1.04% on the right posterior and left hepatic lobes, respectively, across different TEs, which was comparable to a reference graph cuts-based method (RDCs = 1.71% and 0.86%). VET-Net also showed a smaller PDFF bias (-0.55%) than graph cuts (0.93%) when tested on a multi-site phantom dataset. Reproducibility (1.94% and 1.59%) and bias (-2.04%) were negatively affected when the auxiliary TE input was not considered.

This hydrogel consisted of chitosan, alginate and hydroxyapatite, and was loaded with zoledronic acid as a model drug. The feasibility of three-dimensional (3D) printing of the thermosensitive hydrogel using the extrusion based technique was investigated. The 3D printing technique called Freeform Reversible Embedded Suspended Hydrogel (FRESH) printing was employed for this purpose. To characterize the composite hydrogels, several tests were conducted. The gelation time, rheological properties, and in vitro drug release were analyzed. Additionally, the cell viability test on human osteosarcoma MG-63 cells for the composite hydrogel was assessed using an MTT assay. The results of the study showed that the zoledronic acid-loaded composite thermosensitive hydrogel was successfully printed using the FRESH 3D printing technique which was not possible otherwise i.e., by using traditional 3D printing techniques. Further examination of the printed constructs using a Scanning Electron Microscope revealed the presence of porous and layered structures. The gelation times of the composite thermosensitive hydrogel was determined to be 10 and 20 min, respectively for scaffolds with and without HA, indicating the successful formation of the gel within a reasonable time to the FRESH technique. The flow behavior of the hydrogel was found to be pseudoplastic, following a non-Newtonian flow pattern with Farrow's constant (N) values of 1.708 and 1.853 for scaffolds with and without hydroxyapatite, respectively. In terms of drug release, scaffolds prepared with and without hydroxyapatite reached nearly 100% of zoledronic acid release in 360 h and 48 h, respectively. The cell viability test on human osteosarcoma MG-63 cells using MTT assay has shown increased cell viability % in the case of composite hydrogel, indicating biocompatibility of the scaffold. Overall, this study successfully developed a composite thermosensitive hydrogel loaded with zoledronic acid for bone regeneration applications and was 3D printed using the FRESH 3D printing technique.

This study evaluated 25G and 27G ILM forceps with two different types of tip shapes, Eckardt and Maxgrip, manufactured by Alcon (A), DORC (B), VitreQ (C), and Katalyst (D). The gripping force was defined as the force required to move the ILM forceps away from a thin paper by pulling the paper. Shaft stiffness was determined by measuring the shaft displacement under a known force. Multiple regression analysis revealed that the gripping force showed significant correlations with the gauge (P<0.001), type of shaft tip (Eckardt/Maxgrip) (P<0.001), and contact area of the tip (P<0.001). The shaft stiffness showed significant correlations with the gauge (P<0.001), length of the base (P<0.001), thickness of the metal of the shaft (P = 0.05), and lumen area of the shaft (P = 0.01). The gripping force and shaft stiffness differed for each product. Thus, vitreoretinal surgeons must select the appropriate type of ILM forceps based on their characteristics.",,,

There are several benefits to utility companies and their customers from this strategy. The main goal of this work is to employ a load scheduling controller (LSC) to model and solve the scheduling issue for household appliances. The LSC offers a solution to the primary problems faced during implementing demand response. The goal is to minimize peak-to-average demand ratios (PADR) and electricity bills while preserving customer satisfaction. Time-varying pricing, intermittent renewable energy, domestic appliance energy demand, storage battery, and grid constraints are all incorporated into the model. The optimal adaptive wind-driven optimization (OAWDO) method is a stochastic optimization technique designed to manage supply, demand, and power price uncertainties. LSC creates the ideal schedule for home appliance running periods using the OAWDO algorithm. This guarantees that every appliance runs as economically as possible on its own. Most appliances run the risk of functioning during low-price hours if just the real time-varying price system is used, which could result in rebound peaks. We combine an inclined block tariff with a real-time-varying price to alleviate this problem. MATLAB is used to do a load scheduling simulation for home appliances based on the OAWDO algorithm. By contrasting it with other algorithms, including the genetic algorithm (GA), the whale optimization algorithm (WOA), the fire-fly optimization algorithm (FFOA), and the wind-driven optimization (WDO) algorithms, the effectiveness of the OAWDO technique is supported. Results indicate that OAWDO works better than current algorithms in terms of reducing power costs, PADR, and rebound peak formation without sacrificing user comfort.",Hua LG,Power China Hua Dong Engineering Corporation Limited,
39498563,Virtual Reality for Preprocedure Planning of Covered Stent Correction of Superior Sinus Venosus Atrial Septal Defects.,2024-12-17,Circulation. Cardiovascular interventions,10.1161/CIRCINTERVENTIONS.123.013964,"Covered stent correction (CSC) of a superior sinus venosus atrial septal defect is an alternative to surgery in selected patients, but anatomic variation means that assessment for CSC requires a 3-dimensional anatomic understanding. Heart VR is a virtual reality (VR) system that rapidly displays and renders multimodality imaging without prior image segmentation. The aim of this study was to evaluate the performance of the Heart VR system to assess patient suitability for CSC. In a blinded fashion, 2 interventionalists reviewed preprocedural computed tomography scans using Heart VR to assess the feasibility of CSC, including the potential need for pulmonary vein protection. The total review time using VR was recorded. Using conventional imaging, 15 patients were deemed suitable for CSC, but at catheterization, 3 cases were unsuitable. Using VR, when both interventionalists agreed that a case was suitable for CSC (n=12), all proved technically feasible. In the 3 cases that were unsuitable for CSC, the interventionalists using VR were either uncertain (n=1) or did not agree on suitability (n=2). The strategy for pulmonary vein protection was correctly identified by interventionalist 1 and 2 in 9/12 and 8/12 cases, respectively. In cases where pulmonary vein protection was required intraprocedurally (n=5), this was correctly identified using Heart VR. Using VR, in 3 cases it was determined that pulmonary vein protection would be required, but this was not the case on balloon interrogation. VR data loading and review times were 82 seconds and 7 minutes, respectively. Verbal feedback indicated that Heart VR assisted in the assessment of case suitability. Heart VR is a rapid and effective tool for predicting suitability for CSC in patients with a superior sinus venosus atrial septal defect and could be a feasible alternative to segmented virtual or physical 3-dimensional models.",,,

However, none of commercially available or prototype cuffless devices have yet been validated according to the appropriate standards. The aim of the present study was to bridge this gap and evaluate the ability of a prototype cuffless device, developed by Aidee Health AS, to track changes in blood pressure compared to a non-invasive, continuous blood pressure monitor (Human NIBP or Nexfin) in a laboratory set up. The performance was evaluated according to the metrics and statistical methodology described in the ISO 81060-3:2022 standard. However, the present study is not a validation study and thus the study was not conducted according to the ISO 81060-3:2022 protocol, e.g., non-invasive reference and distribution of age not fulfilled. Data were sampled continuously, beat-to-beat, from both the cuffless and the reference device. The cuffless device was calibrated once using the reference BP measurement. Three different techniques (isometric exercise, mental stress, and cold pressor test) were used to induce blood pressure changes in 38 healthy adults. The mean difference (standard deviation) was 0.3 (8.7) mmHg for systolic blood pressure, 0.04 (6.6) mmHg for diastolic blood pressure, and 0.8 (7.9) mmHg for mean arterial pressure, meeting the Accuracy requirement of ISO 81060-3:2022 (≤6.0 (10.0) mmHg). The corresponding results for the Stability criteria were 1.9 (9.2) mmHg, 2.9 (8.1) mmHg and 2.5 (9.5) mmHg. The acceptance criteria for the Change requirement were achieved for the 85th percentile of ≤50% error for diastolic blood pressure and mean arterial pressure but were higher than the limit for systolic blood pressure (56% vs. ≤50%) and for all parameters for the 50th percentile (32%-39% vs. ≤25%). The present study demonstrated that the cuffless device could track blood pressure changes in healthy adults across different activities and showed promising results in achieving the acceptance criteria from ISO 81060-3:2022.",Stepanov A; Bøtker-Rasmussen KG; Seeberg TM; Westgaard E,Aidee Health AS,

The aim of this study is to prospectively assess the feasibility of this advanced OCT probe in interpreting ex vivo images of colorectal polyp tissue and to identify necessary steps for further development. A total of 13 colorectal lesions from 9 patients, removed during endoscopic resection, were imaged ex vivo with the OCT device and compared with histopathological images that served as the gold standard for diagnostics. Normal tissue from one patient, removed during the endoscopic procedure, was imaged as a negative control. We assessed the presence of features indicative for polyp type and degree of dysplasia, by comparing OCT images to histopathological images and by evaluating the presence of OCT-specific features identified by previous studies, such as effacement (loss of layered tissue structure), a hyperreflective epithelial layer, and irregularity of the surface. As verified by corresponding histological images, tissue structures such as blood vessels and tissue layers could be distinguished in OCT images of the normal tissue sample. Detailed structures on histological images such as crypts and cell nuclei could not be identified in the OCT images. However, we did identify OCT features specific for colorectal lesions, such as effacement and a hyperreflective epithelial layer. In general, the imaging depth was about 1 mm. Some relevant tissue structures could be observed in OCT images of the novel device. However, some adaptations, such as increasing imaging depth using a laser with a longer central wavelength, are required to improve its clinical value for the imaging of colorectal lesions.",de Jong IM,Scinvivo B.V,jurgen.futterer@radboudumc.nl.

This paper first introduces an assessment model of maximum DG hosting capacity in distribution network based on optimal power flow (OPF). Then, a two-step method that combines the linearization method and the recursive method is proposed, which consists of two parts: firstly, using linearization method to quickly calculate the preliminary assessment value of maximum DG hosting capacity, and then using a recursive method to accurately correct the preliminary assessment value. Additionally, the proposed improved comprehensive sensitivity index and safety constraint verification method can enhance the computational efficiency and accuracy of the recursive algorithm. Finally, the proposed methods were simulated and validated on the IEEE 33-bus system.",,,
39493349,"Integrating Big Data, Artificial Intelligence, and motion analysis for emerging precision medicine applications in Parkinson's Disease.",,Journal of big data,10.1186/s40537-024-01023-3,"One of the key challenges in Big Data for clinical research and healthcare is how to integrate new sources of data, whose relation to disease processes are often not well understood, with multiple classical clinical measurements that have been used by clinicians for years to describe disease processes and interpret therapeutic outcomes. Without such integration, even the most promising data from emerging technologies may have limited, if any, clinical utility. This paper presents an approach to address this challenge, illustrated through an example in Parkinson's Disease (PD) management. We show how data from various sensing sources can be integrated with traditional clinical measurements used in PD; furthermore, we show how leveraging Big Data frameworks, augmented by Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithms, can distinctively enrich the data resources available to clinicians. We showcase the potential of this approach in a cohort of 50 PD patients who underwent both evaluations with an Integrated Motion Analysis Suite (IMAS) composed of a battery of multimodal, portable, and wearable sensors and traditional Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS)-III evaluations. Through techniques including Principal Component Analysis (PCA), elastic net regression, and clustering analysis we demonstrate how this combined approach can be used to improve clinical motor assessments and to develop personalized treatments. The scalability of our approach enables systematic data generation and analysis on increasingly larger datasets, confirming the integration potential of IMAS, whose use in PD assessments is validated herein, within Big Data paradigms. Compared to existing approaches, our solution offers a more comprehensive, multi-dimensional view of patient data, enabling deeper clinical insights and greater potential for personalized treatment strategies. Additionally, we show how IMAS can be integrated into established clinical practices, facilitating its adoption in routine care and complementing emerging methods, for instance, non-invasive brain stimulation. Future work will aim to augment our data repositories with additional clinical data, such as imaging and biospecimen data, to further broaden and enhance these foundational methodologies, leveraging the full potential of Big Data and AI.",Dipietro L; Wagner T,Highland Instruments,

Five healthy subjects participated. The magnetic field recording evoked by median nerve electrical stimulation at the elbow with electrical intensity that minimized the pronator quadratus and flexor carpi radialis muscle response was measured with 132-channel superconducting quantum interference device magnetoneurography. The current distributions were reconstructed from magnetic fields with the spatial filter method. The magnetic fields evoked by electrical stimulation at the index distal interphalangeal joint were also measured. After median nerve elbow stimulation, intra-axonal current and inward currents flowing perpendicularly to the nerve pathway were visualized. The mean ± SD inward current intensity at the center of the carpal tunnel area was significantly larger with elbow stimulation than with index distal interphalangeal joint stimulation: 1.11 ± 0.65 nAm versus 0.51 ± 0.15 nAm (p = 0.047). Magnetic field measurement in the carpal tunnel area with adjusted submaximal stimulation at the elbow can detect larger signals compared with digit stimulation.

However, these models are limited since they are often derived from a single patient or represent a mean of several groups. The present study aimed to better characterize the anatomical differences of the nasal cavity in a European sub-population and to assess the potential impact of anatomical variations on intranasal deposition by medical devices. Ninety-eight cranial computed tomography scans of patients were selected and analyzed in 2D and 3D conformations. They showed symmetry of cavities and a high level of heterogeneity of measurements, especially volume and area, in the population. Three anatomical groups with distinct nasal geometry were identified and 3D nasal casts of the most representative patient of each group were printed. Fluorescein was administered using three medical devices: a nasal spray, a sonic jet nebulizer and a prototype mesh-nebulizer. The deposition profiles were compared with the Aeronose® as a reference. Our results show that anatomical variations influenced the deposition profiles depending on the device, with a higher variation with spray and the mesh-nebulizer.

This systematic review aims to summarize the published evidence on patient-reported outcomes (PROs) in individuals with MCI due to AD and mild AD dementia. Comprehensive searches were conducted across five major databases to identify studies reporting on utility values, disutilities, and QoL measures in these patient populations. A total of 23 studies were included that utilized various QoL assessment tools, including EQ-5D (n = 14), SF-36/SF-12 (n = 4), and QOL-AD (n = 11). Reported EQ-5D scores ranged from 0.81 to 0.92 for patients with MCI and from 0.67 to 0.85 for those with mild AD, indicating a noticeable decline in QoL as the disease progresses. QOL-AD scores ranged from 33.8 to 42.5 for MCI and from 32.4 to 38.1 for mild AD, equally reflecting the greater impairment in QoL with disease advancement. Interventions were generally associated with smaller declines in PROs compared to placebo, suggesting a positive impact of treatment in mitigating QoL deterioration. The findings underscore the significant QoL differences between MCI and mild AD, emphasizing the potential benefit of early intervention to preserve QoL and delay disease progression. This review highlights the importance of continued research to better understand QoL in patients with MCI and mild AD dementia, particularly in terms of capturing comprehensive patient-reported outcomes and evaluating the effectiveness of interventions over time. These findings can contribute to a more informed approach in clinical practice and support decision-making in the management of early-stage AD.",Campbell J; Lavoie L; Farraia M; Huelin R; Zhang Q; Tahami Monfared AA,Evidence Synthesis; Eisai Inc.,Amir_Tahami@eisai.com.

We aimed to investigate the association of fractional flow reserve (FFR) and plaque vulnerability with coronary inflammation. Patients with suspected coronary artery disease (CAD) who underwent CCTA and invasive FFR measurements within 90-day were included. A cloud-based medical device, CaRi-Heart, serves as a surrogate tool for evaluating coronary inflammation based on FAI by analyzing CCTA images. The correlations between CCTA-defined plaque characteristics, invasive coronary angiographic and physiologic assessments, and CaRi-Heart risk were analyzed. The primary endpoint was the patient-oriented composite outcome (POCO) consisting of all-cause death, any myocardial infarction, and any revascularization.

The utilization of membrane aerated biological reactors (MABRs) to renovate existing WWTPs could be an opportunity in this sense. In this study, the control of the flow at the outlet of a pure, open-end MABR was used as a strategy to minimize the oxygen consumption and obtain high oxygen transfer efficiencies (OTEs). OTE values of more than 80% were observed, which are not so common in the literature and are comparable to those obtained with a close-end configuration. High efficiencies (85%) were found for the removal of both COD and total nitrogen from samples of real wastewater. A techno-economic analysis, comparing a conventional activate sludge (CAS) plant with a MABR, both with a treatment capacity of 25,000 equivalent inhabitants (e.i.), found that the MABR only needed approx. 1/5 of the energy required by the CAS.

Out of the four nitrile examination glove brands tested, American Nitrile Slate brand had superior durability results and was found to be made of acrylonitrile butadiene rubber, as expected. The U.S. Medical glove brand, which was also found to be pure nitrile, had the superior tensile results, consistently reaching over 800% elongation before breaking. Although Restore Touch brand exam gloves were made of nitrile, they exhibited substandard tensile strength and durability due to the thinness of the glove, which barely met the ASTM minimum thickness value. The Vglove brand glove had the overall worst mechanical properties, did not meet ASTM requirements, and had an NMR spectrum consistent with that of a polyvinyl chloride glove, rather than nitrile. Gloves that fail to meet the minimum performance requirements should not be used for medical purposes to protect the health and safety of consumers.",,,

This paper investigates the potential economic impact of the technology in the UK through cost savings analysis, and the redirection of savings into further diagnoses. A cost comparison study was conducted, comparing AcuPebble to the standard diagnostic approach of home respiratory polygraphy (HRP) and in-clinic polysomnography (PSG), estimating the net benefit value (NBV) and return on investment (ROI). Cohort size was varied to model the effects of volume discounted pricing and staff training costs. To demonstrate the potential for cost savings, data on the healthcare costs of undiagnosed OSA patients were used to quantify the benefit of increased OSA diagnosis rates, as facilitated by AcuPebble. For 500 uses of AcuPebble, the NBV in the diagnostic pathway over one year would be in excess of £101,169, increasing to £341,665 for 1,500 uses, £1,263,993 for 5,000 uses, and to £2,628,198 for 10,000 uses, with ROIs of 2.02, 3.03, 5.05, and 6.56, respectively. Given an initial cohort of 1,500 patients, 4,555 extra AcuPebble studies could be completed by redirecting resources from HRP/PSG.

Current predictions are mainly driven by technological developments-technologies usually being developed for different markets-and are often based on ableist assumptions. In online conversations and a discussion panel at the 2023 International Society for Augmentative and Alternative Communication conference, we explored alternative futures by adopting different starting positions. Our case is presented under five headings: questioning the dominance of predictions that artificial intelligence and brain-computer interfaces will define the future of AAC; resisting disability being framed medically, as a problem to be solved, yet acknowledging both the pleasures and pains of being disabled; declaring that people who use AAC-as cyborgs of necessity rather than choice-should have choice and ownership of our technologies; challenging notions of independence as the necessary end goal for disabled bodies and considering interdependence as a human right; imagining alternative futures in which all people who use AAC are accepted and embraced for our communication and self-expression. This manifesto is an invitation for further discussion, and we welcome responses. While our focus is AAC, and three of the authors use AAC, we believe that our stance could be relevant to other disability communities in turn. This paper is about who gets to imagine disability futures and whose voices are left out. It is about how uncritical these futures can be, often presuming values that disabled people, in all their diversity, may not share.",Williams K,Independent Researcher,G.Pullin@dundee.ac.uk.

A total of 2/3 of respondents had experience diagnosing CA and reported having 10% of patients with CA in patients with HFpEF. Systematic screening for CA of all patients with HFpEF was performed by 10% of responders, whereas 24% did not consider the screening. Most responders (39%) used left ventricular hypertrophy as a screening criterion. Serum protein electrophoresis with immunofixation of free light chain and urine protein electrophoresis or cardiac magnetic resonance were selected by half of the responders as a first-line diagnostic tool. The combination of serum protein electrophoresis with immunofixation free light chain, urine protein electrophoresis, and bone scintigraphy was considered by 32% of the participants. CA DMT was available for 48% of the physicians. About 82% of responders would administrate HF to patients with HFpEF with CA, with the most preferable drugs being diuretics, sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors, and renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors. In conclusion, the results reveal the uncertainties among physicians worldwide regarding the need for CA screening of patients with HFpEF. CA remains a disease with very heterogeneous management, particularly, in the screening and diagnostic workup. The HF community should aim to educate on CA and improve access to DMT.",Shutov M; Skouri H,Cardiology Department; Cardiology Division,a.shchendrygina@gmail.com.

Bleeding from gastroesophageal varices type 1 (GOV1) is treated like EVs. In contrast, other forms of gastric variceal bleeding, including gastroesophageal varices type 2 (GOV2) and isolated gastric varices types 1 (IGV1) and 2 (IGV2), are treated with varying endoscopic approaches. Nonendoscopic methods include transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) or balloon-occluded retrograde transvenous obliteration (BRTO). This technology report focuses on endoscopic management of gastric varices (GVs). The MEDLINE database was searched through August 2022 for relevant articles by using key words such as gastric varices, glue, cyanoacrylate, thrombin, sclerosing agents, band ligation, topical hemostatic spray, coils, EUS, TIPS, and BRTO. The article was drafted, reviewed, and edited by the American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ASGE) Technology Committee and approved by the Governing Board of the ASGE. Endoscopic injection with cyanoacrylate (CYA) glue has been the primary endoscopic method to treat GVs. EUS-guided angiotherapy with CYA glue and coil embolization has emerged as an alternative method enabling improved detection of GVs with a high technical success for targeting and obliterating GVs. Combining CYA glue with coil therapy allows the coil to act as a scaffold for the glue, reducing the risk of glue embolization and improving outcomes. Alternative injectates or topical treatments have been described but remain poorly studied. The mainstay paradigm for the endoscopic management of gastric variceal bleeding is the injection of CYA glue. The published success of EUS-guided angiotherapy using CYA glue with or without embolization coils has increased our treatment armamentarium.",; Rahimi EF; Bhatt A; Chandrasekhara V; Kahn A; Pannala R; Law RJ; ,; Department of Gastroenterology and Hepatology; Department of Gastroenterology,

Human fibroblast conditioned media contains the fibroblast secretome including growth factors as well as exosomes. The potential benefits of topically applied exosomes are gaining interest in the medical aesthetic field. This article aims to summarize the preclinical and clinical data available on regenerative HFCM-based topical skincare with a focus on studies investigating products applied to improve overall facial skin rejuvenation and/or after in-office cosmetic procedures. In addition, available data on fibroblast-derived exosomes will be covered. A focused literature review was conducted to provide an overview of evidence on HFCM-based topical skincare. Human fibroblast conditioned media-based skincare significantly reduces signs of skin aging including photodamage, coarse lines and wrinkles, and sagging. After in-office cosmetic procedures, HFCM-based skincare can stimulate skin recovery and reduce downtime as well as provide skin quality benefits to enhance overall treatment outcomes. Application of purified exosomes from HFCM also demonstrated significant improvements in multiple skin aging parameters.

We investigated the performance of an AI-based software device used in a large teleradiology practice for intracranial haemorrhage (ICH) detection. A randomly selected subset of all non-contrast CT head (NCCTH) scans from patients aged ≥18 years referred for urgent teleradiology reporting from 44 different hospitals within the United Kingdom over a 4-month period was considered for this evaluation. Thirty auditing radiologists evaluated the NCCTH scans and the AI output retrospectively. Agreement between AI and auditing radiologists is reported along with failure analysis. A total of 1315 NCCTH scans from as many distinct patients (median age, 73 years [IQR 53-84]; 696 [52.9%] females) were evaluated. One hundred twelve (8.5%) scans had ICH. Overall agreement, positive percent agreement, negative percent agreement, and Gwet's AC1 of AI with radiologists were found to be 93.5% (95% CI, 92.1-94.8), 85.7% (77.8-91.6), 94.3% (92.8-95.5) and 0.92 (0.90-0.94), respectively, in detecting ICH. 9 out of 16 false negative outcomes were due to missed subarachnoid haemorrhages and these were predominantly subtle haemorrhages. The most common reason for false positive results was due to motion artefacts. AI demonstrated very good agreement with the radiologists in the detection of ICH. Real-world evaluation of an AI-based CT head interpretation device is reported.

Acceptance by healthcare professionals (HCPs) and patients is crucial for successful implementation. Evidence-based standards, technological infrastructure and regulatory processes are needed to integrate digital tools into clinical practice. Personal health records provide continuity and aid decision-making, while machine-learning algorithms may help in optimizing therapies and improving outcomes. Digital healthcare can negate geographical barriers, enabling patients in remote areas to access specialist endocrine expertise. We review available and developing digital tools to manage care for patients requiring growth hormone (GH) therapy for growth failure conditions. GH is most often administered via daily injections over several years; continuous adherence is necessary but may become insufficient. Future development and integration of electronic platforms for GH therapy requires involvement of all stakeholders in design-thinking approaches and human-factor testing. Growzen Connect is an innovative digital ecosystem designed to increase the management and monitoring of GH therapy, comprising the easypod device and connected mobile apps. It provides a real-time overview of a patient's therapy, including adherence and growth response, which aids decision-making by HCPs and empowers patients to engage in their therapy journey. Incorporating prediction models for adherence and growth in the ecosystem helps patients build treatment habits and allows issues to be addressed in a timely fashion.

We recruited 59 controls (without structural abnormalities and gastrointestinal symptoms), 44 patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) and 31 with Crohn's disease (CD). Biopsies from various segments of the upper and lower gastrointestinal tract were collected. Microbial composition was assessed via 16S rRNA gene amplicon analysis and the bacterial load of the mucosal biopsies were assessed via qPCR. The MAM was examined in the context of disease status, PPI usage, the severity of gastrointestinal symptoms, and the symptom response to a standardised nutrient challenge (SNC). Microbial communities of the MAM in the upper and lower gastrointestinal tract differed. IBD patients were characterised by relative and absolute depletion of numerous genera known to produce butyrate and/or propionate, with the largest differentiation being the depletion of Faecalibacterium in the lower gastrointestinal tract of CD patients. Notably, PPI users exhibited an enrichment of Faecalibacterium in the lower gastrointestinal tract. The severity of gastrointestinal symptoms, as well as the symptom response to the SNC, were significantly associated with MAM composition in the gastrointestinal tract. The absolute and relative composition of the MAM is variable across different segments of the gastrointestinal tract. These quantitative changes indicates that MAM can be targeted in specific segments of the GI tract to improve patient outcomes.",,,

Understanding the impact on hemodynamic stability over time is crucial for optimizing patient treatment. To determine if an MAFP reduces the need for pharmacological circulatory support without compromising hemodynamics compared with standard care in STEMI-CS. This was a substudy of the Danish-German (DanGer) Shock trial, an international, multicenter, open-label randomized clinical trial. Patients from 14 heart centers across Denmark, Germany, and the UK were enrolled. Inclusion criteria for the trial were STEMI and systolic blood pressure less than 100 mm Hg or ongoing vasopressor treatment, left ventricular ejection fraction less than 45%, and arterial lactate level greater than 2.5 mmol/L. Of the enrolled patients, after exclusions from death in the catheterization laboratory or immediately on intensive care unit (ICU) admission, the remaining patients had serial recordings of hemodynamics, arterial lactate, and use of vasoactive drugs.

From 355 enrolled patients, 324 (mean [IQR] age, 68 [58-75] years; 259 male [80%]) underwent ICU treatment (169 [52%] in the MAFP group, 155 [48%] in the standard-care group). Baseline characteristics were balanced. There was no difference in heart rate between groups, and mean arterial pressure was above the treatment target of 65 mm Hg in both groups but was achieved with a lower VIS in the MAFP group. No difference in arterial lactate level was found between groups at randomization, but on arrival to the ICU, the MAFP group had significantly lower arterial lactate levels compared with the standard-care group (mean difference, 1.3 mmol/L; 95% CI, 0.7-1.9 mmol/L), a difference that persisted throughout the first 24 hours of observation. The MAFP group achieved lactate normalization (<2 mmol/L) 12 hours (95% CI, 5-18 hours) before the standard-care group.

We conducted interviews with 55 primary care clinicians across 21 states. Participants described CGM benefits for patients with varying levels of diabetes self-management and engagement. Major barriers to prescribing included lack of insurance coverage for CGM costs to patients, and time constraints. Participants identified resources needed to foster CGM prescribing, for example, clinician education, support staff, and EHR compatibility. Primary care clinicians face several challenges to prescribing CGM, but they are interested in learning more to help them offer it to their patients. This study reinforces the ongoing need for improved clinician education on CGM technology and continued expansion of insurance coverage for people with both type 1 and type 2 diabetes.",,,tristen.hall@ucdenver.edu.

In this study, we evaluated whether the dose calculation accuracy on HyperSight CBCT was sufficient for treatment planning in prostate and lung cancer patients. HyperSight CBCT was compared to planning CT (pCT) in terms of HU-to-mass density (MD) calibration curves. For twenty prostate patients and twenty lung patients, differences in DVH parameters, and 3D global gamma between dose distributions calculated on pCT and free breathing HyperSight CBCT were evaluated. For this purpose, HyperSight CBCT acquired at the first fraction was rigidly registered to the pCT, delineations from the CT were propagated and the dose was recalculated on the HyperSight CBCT. For each insert of the HU-to-MD calibration phantom, the HU values of HyperSight CBCT and pCT agreed within 35 HU. For prostate maximum deviations in PTV D HyperSight CBCT enabled accurate dose calculation for prostate cancer patients, without implementation of a specific HyperSight CBCT-to-MD curve. For lung cancer patients, breathing motion hampered accurate dose calculations.",,,n.sijtsema@erasmusmc.nl.
39452498,The Effect of Evaluating Perfusion with Infrared Fluorescent Angiography on Flap Survival in Head and Neck Free Flap Reconstruction.,,"Diseases (Basel, Switzerland)",10.3390/diseases12100255,"Intraoperative fluid management is one of the most important factors affecting optimal perfusion in the microcirculatory area in patients that undergo flap surgery. While insufficient fluid administration in the intraoperative period leads to flap complications and organ dysfunction, volume load can cause complications such as edema in the denervated flap tissue, the opening of the sutures, or fat necrosis. The Infrared Fluorescent Angiography Perfusion Evaluation Device (SPY) is one of the many noninvasive techniques that evaluate the well-being of microcirculation at the tissue level. This device monitors and scores the perfusion distribution in the flap area. This retrospective study aimed to investigate the effect of fluid resuscitation in head and neck free flap transfer surgery on flap quality and patient outcomes according to the change in SPY scores. This study included 39 ASA I-II patients who were aged 18-60 years and underwent simultaneous free flap reconstruction of the head and neck between 2015 and 2021. Patients' blood pressure, body temperature, hemoglobin, pH, and lactate values were recorded at both baseline and end of the operation. Also, the SPY ""Infrared Fluorescent Angiography Perfusion Evaluation Device"" scores, the amount of intraoperative fluid and transfusion, bleeding and urine output, and the duration of mechanical ventilation, anesthesia and surgery, and the duration and amount of drainage, the length of stay in hospital and intensive care unit, and the presence of flap infection, detachment, necrosis and loss, and re-exploration rate were recorded for the patients. The difference between the first and last measured SPY values was observed to be positively correlated with the length of stay in the hospital and intensive care unit and the duration of drainage. There was a positive correlation between the length of stay in the hospital and intensive care unit and the duration of drainage, the amount of drainage, as well as the duration of anesthesia and the duration of surgery ( It has been concluded that SPY-guided fluid management can be beneficial in preventing morbidities, such as extended hospital and intensive care stay, by reducing flap infection, mechanical ventilation duration, and drainage, with early diagnosis of insufficient perfusion.",Saracoglu A; Saracoglu KT,Department of Anaesthesiology,

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the biomechanical integrity of two fixation materials [titanium (Ti) and hydroxyapatite/poly-L-lactide (HA-PLLA)]. In this study, we simulated the mechanical properties of miniplate and screw fixations in two different systems by finite element analysis. A three-dimensional mandibular model was constructed and a fibula free flap and reconstruction surface were designed. The anterior and posterior end of the free flap was positioned with two miniplates and two additional miniplates were applied to the angled area of the fibula. The masticatory loading was applied considering seven principal muscles. The peak von Mises stress (PVMS) distribution, size of fixation deformation, principal stresses on bones, and gap opening size were measured to evaluate the material properties of the fixation. In the evaluation of properties, superior results were observed with both fixation methods immediately after surgery. However, after the formation of callus between bone segments at 2 months, the performance of Ti fixation decreased over time and the differences between the two fixations became minimal by 6 months after surgery. The result of the study implies the positive clinical potential of the HA-PLLA fixation system applied in fibula free flap reconstruction.",,,

This study aims to clarify the relative impacts of in vitro biomimetic 'preculture composition' and 'preculture duration' before in vivo implantation as key criteria for the optimization of BTE design. These parameters are directly related to in vitro osteogenic differentiation (OD) and mineralization and are being investigated across different osteoprogenitor-loaded biomaterials, specifically fibrous calcium phosphate-polycaprolactone (CaP-mPCL) scaffolds and gelatin methacryloyl (GelMA) hydrogels. The results show that OD and mineralization levels prior to implantation, enhanced by a mineralization medium supplement to the osteogenic medium (OM), significantly improve ectopic BTE outcomes, regardless of the biomaterial type. Specifically, preculture conditions are pivotal in achieving more faithful mimicry of human bone structure, cellular and extracellular matrix composition and organization, and provide control over bone marrow composition.

Magnetically levitated device recipients are experiencing a lower incidence of adverse events, including freedom from gastrointestinal bleeding (72.6%), device malfunction (82.9%), and stroke (86.7%) at 5 years. Additionally, a focus on a subgroup of patients younger than 50 years of age has demonstrated both superior outcomes in survival (91.6% survival at 1 year and 72.6% survival at 5 years) and decreased incidence of adverse events compared with older recipients. This younger cohort also demonstrated more tolerance to the characteristics of sex, race, ethnicity, and psychosocial indicators that are associated with worse outcomes after heart transplantation.

Incorporating ECM biomolecular cues and its complex 3D bioarchitecture in the design stages of such in vitro platforms is essential to better recapitulate the native tumor microenvironment. To materialize these needs, herein we describe an innovative flow-on-repellent (FLORE) 3D extrusion bioprinting technique that leverages expedited and automatized bioink deposition onto a customized superhydrophobic printing bed. We demonstrate that this approach enables the rapid generation of quasi-spherical breast cancer-stroma hybrid models in a mode governed by surface wettability rather than bioink rheological features. For this purpose, an ECM-mimetic bioink comprising breast tissue-specific decellularized matrix in the form of microfiber bundles (dECM-μF) and photocrosslinkable hyaluronan (HAMA), was formulated to generate triple negative breast tumor-stroma models. Leveraging on the FLORE bioprinting approach, a rapid, automated, and reproducible fabrication of physiomimetic breast cancer hydrogel beads was successfully demonstrated. Hydrogel beads size with and without dECM-μF was easily tailored by modelling droplet deposition time on the superhydrophobic bed. Interestingly, in heterotypic breast cancer-stroma beads a self-arrangement of different cellular populations was observed, independent of dECM-μF inclusion, with CAFs clustering overtime within the fabricated models. Drug screening assays showed that the inclusion of CAFs and dECM-μF also impacted the overall response of these living constructs when incubated with gemcitabine chemotherapeutics, with dECM-μF integration promoting a trend for higher resistance in ECM-enriched models. Overall, we developed a rapid fabrication approach leveraging on extrusion bioprinting and superhydrophobic surfaces to process photocrosslinkable dECM bioinks and to generate increasingly physiomimetic tumor-stroma-matrix platforms for drug screening.",,,vm.gaspar@ua.pt.
39440305,The sixth sense: how much does interictal intracranial EEG add to determining the focality of epileptic networks?,,Brain communications,10.1093/braincomms/fcae320,"Intracranial EEG is used for two main purposes: to determine (i) if epileptic networks are amenable to focal treatment and (ii) where to intervene. Currently, these questions are answered qualitatively and differently across centres. There is a need to quantify the focality of epileptic networks systematically, which may guide surgical decision-making, enable large-scale data analysis and facilitate multi-centre prospective clinical trials. We analysed interictal data from 101 patients with drug-resistant epilepsy who underwent pre-surgical evaluation with intracranial EEG at a single centre. We chose interictal data because of its potential to reduce the morbidity and cost associated with ictal recording. Sixty-five patients had unifocal seizure onset on intracranial EEG, and 36 were non-focal or multi-focal. We quantified the spatial dispersion of implanted electrodes and interictal intracranial EEG abnormalities for each patient. We compared these measures against the '5 Sense Score,' a pre-implant prediction of the likelihood of focal seizure onset, assessed the ability to predict unifocal seizure onset by combining these metrics and evaluated how predicted focality relates to subsequent treatment and outcomes. The spatial dispersion of intracranial EEG electrodes predicted network focality with similar performance to the 5-SENSE score [area under the receiver operating characteristic curve = 0.68 (95% confidence interval 0.57, 0.78)], indicating that electrode placement accurately reflected pre-implant information. A cross-validated model combining the 5-SENSE score and the spatial dispersion of interictal intracranial EEG abnormalities significantly improved this prediction [area under the receiver operating characteristic curve = 0.79 (95% confidence interval 0.70, 0.88); ",,,

The mammalian nose serves two purposes: olfaction and breathing. Because respiratory patterns are impacted by odors, we hypothesized that nasal respiratory airflow may be altered in anosmia. We apply a wearable device that precisely logs nasal airflow for 24-hour-long sessions in participants with isolated congenital anosmia and controls. We observe significantly altered patterns of respiratory nasal airflow in anosmia in wake and in sleep. These differences allow classification of anosmia at 83% accuracy using the respiratory trace alone. Patterns of respiratory airflow have pronounced impact on health, emotion and cognition. We therefore suggest that a portion of the deleterious outcomes associated with anosmia may be attributed to altered patterns of respiratory nasal airflow rather than a direct result of lost odor perception per se.",,,lior.gorodisky@weizmann.ac.il.
39436614,Monte Carlo dose calculation for photon and electron radiotherapy on dynamically deforming anatomy.,2025-04-25,Medical physics,10.1002/mp.17472,"Dose calculation in radiotherapy aims to accurately estimate and assess the dose distribution of a treatment plan. Monte Carlo (MC) dose calculation is considered the gold standard owing to its ability to accurately simulate particle transport in inhomogeneous media. However, uncertainties such as the patient's dynamically deforming anatomy can still lead to differences between the delivered and planned dose distribution. Development and validation of a deformable voxel geometry for MC dose calculations (DefVoxMC) to account for dynamic deformation in the dose calculation process of photon- and electron-based radiotherapy treatment plans for clinically motivated cases. DefVoxMC relies on the subdivision of a regular voxel geometry into dodecahedrons. It allows shifting the dodecahedrons' corner points according to the deformation in the patient's anatomy using deformation vector fields (DVF). DefVoxMC is integrated into the Swiss Monte Carlo Plan (SMCP) to allow the MC dose calculation of photon- and electron-based treatment plans on the deformable voxel geometry. DefVoxMC is validated in two steps. A compression test and a Fano test are performed in silico. Delta4 (for photon beams) and EBT4 film measurements in a cubic PMMA phantom (for electron beams) are performed on a TrueBeam in Developer Mode for clinically motivated treatment plans. During these measurements, table motion is used to mimic rigid dynamic patient motion. The measured and calculated dose distributions are compared using gamma passing rate (GPR) (3% / 2 mm (global), 10% threshold). DefVoxMC is used to study the impact of patient-recorded breathing motion on the dose distribution for clinically motivated lung and breast cases, each prescribed 50 Gy to 50% of the target volume. A volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) and an arc mixed-beam radiotherapy (Arc-MBRT) plan are created for the lung and breast case, respectively. For the dose calculation, the dynamic deformation of the patient's anatomy is described by DVFs obtained from deformable image registration of the different phases of 4DCTs. The resulting dose distributions are compared to the ones of the static situation using dose-volume histograms and dose differences. DefVoxMC is successfully integrated into the SMCP to enable the MC dose calculation of photon- and electron-based treatments on a dynamically deforming patient anatomy. The compression and the Fano test agree within 1.0% and 0.1% with the expected result, respectively. Delta4 and EBT4 film measurements agree with the calculated dose by a GPR >95%. For the clinically motivated cases, breathing motion resulted in areas with a dose increase of up to 26.9 Gy (lung) and up to 7.6 Gy (breast) compared to the static situation. The largest dose differences are observed in high-dose-gradient regions perpendicular to the beam plane, consequently decreasing the planning target volume coverage (V95%) by 4.2% for the lung case and 2.0% for the breast case. A novel method for MC dose calculation for photon- and electron-based treatments on dynamically deforming anatomy is successfully developed and validated. Applying DefVoxMC to clinically motivated cases, we found that breathing motion has non-negligible impact on the dosimetric plan quality.",,,

Methods and Results: In this study, incorporation of a stirring mechanism into the double-chamber bioreactor design was tested to homogenize the media components between the two chambers. In addition to the improved media homogenization, the stirring culture was observed to have higher yield and enrichment of central memory T cells, a T cell subpopulation that has been associated with improved therapeutic efficacy compared with a static control. BECA-D with a stirring mechanism was evaluated for its performance in culturing T cells in comparison with a static control, BECA-D, and an industry benchmark, G-Rex10 (Wilson Wolf Manufacturing). BECA-D with a stirring mechanism was able to preferentially promote the enrichment of central memory T cells compared with the static cultures, indicative of the effect of the stirring mechanism.

Furthermore, IL6 plays a fundamental role in detecting and differentiating tumor cells, including colorectal cancer (CRC) cells. Therefore, given its range of biological activities and pathological role, IL6 determination has been claimed for the diagnosis/prognosis of immune-mediated diseases. Herein, a comparative study is presented of labeled and label-free electrochemical immunosensors involving a hierarchical Au@Pt nanoparticle/polymer hybrid material for detecting IL6. The electrochemical immunosensors were independently coupled to the surface of screen-printed carbon electrodes (SPCEs) previously modified with polymeric layers.

While its use of real-time brain activity in a closed-loop system is similar to brain-computer interfaces, instead of controlling an external device like the latter, the goal of NF is to change a targeted brain function. In this special issue on NF, we present current and future methods for extracting and manipulating neural function, how these methods may reveal new insights about brain function, applications, and rarely discussed ethical considerations of guiding and interpreting the brain activity of others. Together, the articles in this issue outline the possibilities of NF use and impact in the real world, poising to influence the development of more effective and personalized NF protocols, improving the understanding of underlying psychological and neurological mechanisms and enhancing treatment precision for various neurological and psychiatric conditions.This article is part of the theme issue 'Neurofeedback: new territories and neurocognitive mechanisms of endogenous neuromodulation'.",,,

To conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of birth prevalence of Pompe disease, the MEDLINE and EMBASE databases were searched for original research articles on the epidemiology of Pompe disease from inception until July 01, 2024. Meta-analysis was performed to estimate global birth prevalence of Pompe disease. The funnel plot was used to describe potential publication bias. Twenty-two studies, screened out of 945 records, were included for data extraction. Studies that fulfilled inclusion criteria involved 15 areas/countries. Global birth prevalence of Pompe disease was 2.0 cases (95% CI: 1.5-2.4) per 100,000 live births. Global birth prevalence of infantile-onset Pompe disease was 1.0 cases (95% CI: 0.5-1.5) per 100,000 live births. Global birth prevalence of late-onset Pompe disease was 2.4 cases (95% CI: 1.8-3.0) per 100,000 live births. The main limitations are that no study was assessed as high-quality and approximately half of the studies were from Europe. Quantitative data on the global epidemiology of Pompe disease could be the fundamental to evaluate the global efforts on building a better world for Pompe disease patients.",Lu C,Beijing Hong Jian Medical Device Company,kwj86213@126.com.

The present review discusses the implications of GO and its ambivalent role in AD. Under anaerobic conditions, GO is rapidly converted to biologically reduced graphene oxide (bioRGO) through microbial respiration. GO addition could promote the release of extracellular polymeric substances and lead to toxic effects on anaerobic microorganisms. However, further research is needed to determine the GO toxic concentration thresholds. GO application can impact biogas production and organic micropollutants removal of anaerobic digesters. Nevertheless, most of the studies have been conducted at batch scale and further work in continuously operated anaerobic digesters is still needed. Finally, the review evaluates the economic potential of GO application in AD systems. Overall, this review lays the foundations to improve the applicability of GO in future full-scale digesters.",,,k.koch@tum.de.

This can result in significant losses for the medical health insurance industry. Consequently, fraud detection is crucial. Currently, companies employ auditors who manually evaluate records and pinpoint fraud. However, an automated and effective method is needed to detect fraud with the continually increasing number of patients seeking health insurance. Blockchain is an emerging technology and is constantly evolving to meet business needs. With its characteristics of immutability, transparency, traceability, and smart contracts, it demonstrates its potential in the health care domain. In particular, self-executable smart contracts are essential to reduce the costs associated with traditional paradigms, which are mostly manual, while preserving privacy and building trust among health care stakeholders, including the patient and the health insurance networks. However, with the proliferation of blockchain development platform options, selecting the right one for health care insurance can be difficult. This study addressed this void and developed an automated decision map recommender system to select the most effective blockchain platform for insurance fraud detection. This study aims to develop smart contracts for detecting health care insurance fraud efficiently. Therefore, we provided a taxonomy of fraud scenarios and implemented their detection using a blockchain platform that was suitable for health care insurance fraud detection. To automatically and efficiently select the best platform, we proposed and implemented a decision map-based recommender system. For developing the decision-map, we proposed a taxonomy of 102 blockchain platforms. We developed smart contracts for 12 fraud scenarios that we identified in the literature. We used the top 2 blockchain platforms selected by our proposed decision-making map-based recommender system, which is tailored for health care insurance fraud. The map used our taxonomy of 102 blockchain platforms classified according to their application domains. The recommender system demonstrated that Hyperledger Fabric was the best blockchain platform for identifying health care insurance fraud. We validated our recommender system by comparing the performance of the top 2 platforms selected by our system. The blockchain platform taxonomy that we created revealed that 59 blockchain platforms are suitable for all application domains, 25 are suitable for financial services, and 18 are suitable for various application domains. We implemented fraud detection based on smart contracts. Our decision map recommender system, which was based on our proposed taxonomy of 102 platforms, automatically selected the top 2 platforms, which were Hyperledger Fabric and Neo, for the implementation of health care insurance fraud detection. Our performance evaluation of the 2 platforms indicated that Fabric surpassed Neo in all performance metrics, as depicted by our recommender system.

Quantitative two-phase, cluster analysis design. The study consisted of the following two phases: (1) a quantitative retrospective chart review to evaluate clinician utilisation and preference for vein visualisation technologies and (2) a quantitative prospective design, including a post-discharge retrospective chart review, to confirm utilisation of vein visualisation technologies and factors influencing clinician decision-making. A total of 16 groups were created based on the cluster analysis and expert clinician input. The results of first-attempt success analyses identified optimal device recommendations for each of the 16 patient groups. For patients older than 2 years old, the NIR device was more likely to result in first-attempt success regardless of BMI or access site and the NIR device was most optimal for almost all categories of paediatric patients regardless of BMI or access site. The transilluminator was found to be the most optimal device to use with younger patients (< 2 years old) who are underweight. Vein visualisation technology is recommended by professional nursing organisations to improve PIV access. Yet, adoption of this useful technology to aid selection of an optimal vein for insertion and visualisation during insertion is limited. This is the first study to develop a clinical decision-making tool for vein visualisation technology in PIVC insertion. Vein visualisation technology allows for a rapid, thorough assessment of patients' vasculature to determine an optimal site for PIVC placement beyond what is visible to the naked eye or achievable using traditional methods. The tool was designed to guide healthcare professionals towards successful first attempt PIVC insertions, thereby improving patient outcomes and efficiency of care. None.",,,

Indeed, industry may direct their focus and resources on studies that will yield results and products that can ultimately generate revenue for the company. Conversely, IICS research questions include (a) refining or getting new indications of available treatments (drug repurposing); (b) optimisation, by comparing various health products or treatment regimens; and (c) innovation, especially for advanced therapies. Multinational IICSs increase the scientific quality of the data by exchange of research ideas, scientific techniques and tools. Participation of patients from different geographical, social and ethnic backgrounds equally adds to the value of study results and yields more generalisable evidence than a study confined to a single geographical location. Multinational IICSs are generally sponsored by non-profit/academic organisations and publicly funded. Funding has been already identified as a main challenge for the conduct IICS and especially for clinical trials (IICTs, IICS where a medical intervention is directly tested).

The last five hammering sounds during the final-size broaching procedure and during the real stem insertion were recorded and analysed in 95 patients who were operated on by one of seven surgeons using two implants (Trident cup, Accolade II, Stryker; G7 cup, Taperloc Complete Microplasty Stem, Zimmer Biomet). The maximum peak was semi-automatically identified and analysed to determine the maximum C-weighted sound pressure level (LCpeak) of each of the five hammering sounds and the equivalent continuous A-weighted sound pressure (LAeq) of the entire five-sound hammering procedure. Among the 95 hips, 25 (26.3%) had ≥ 3 mm of postoperative subsidence. Therefore, 125 of 475 hammering sounds (LCpeak) and 25 of 95 hammering procedures (LAeq) in both the broaching procedure and stem insertion procedure were associated with postoperative subsidence. The hammering sound level in both the broaching and stem insertion procedures were significantly weaker in patients with postoperative subsidence than in those without subsidence. Among the seven surgeons, there was intra-surgeon and inter-surgeon heterogeneity with large variance regarding the sound levels. With univariate and multivariate analyses, the hammering sound level was independently associated with postoperative subsidence in the two models. A weak hammering sound level was associated with postoperative subsidence in THA with a cementless stem.

Endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) has recently become the primary treatment option, owing to the fewer side effects compared to those with open surgery. However, stents used for conventional EVAR often cause side-branch occlusion, which alters the perfusion of vital organs. Recently, multilayer flow modulator (MFM) stents have been used as a new treatment for arterial aneurysms. These stents appear to be feasible owing to their unique design consisting of an uncoated three-dimensionally braided multilayered structure. MFM stents generally remodulate laminar flow and reduce the flow velocity in the aneurysmal sac, leading to thrombosis, which causes the aneurysm to shrink over time. Thus, they reduce the risk of mortality. Moreover, they reduce morbidity by preserving the side-branch blood flow. They can be easily applied to complex aneurysms and are ready to use without customization, which shortens the waiting time for interventions. This study aimed to evaluate the role of MFM stents in the treatment of arterial aneurysms based on available data.",Ekingen E,Antalya Provincial Health Directorate,

The present study aimed to characterize adverse outcomes associated with PEGylation of protein-based therapeutics on immunogenicity, pharmacologic properties, and safety. A targeted review of English language articles published from 1990 to September 29, 2023, was conducted. Of the 29 studies included in this review, 18 reported adverse safety outcomes such as hematologic complications, hepatic toxicity, injection site reactions, arthralgia, nausea, infections, grade 3 or 4 adverse events (AEs), and AE-related discontinuations and dose modifications. Fifteen studies reported immunogenicity-related outcomes, such as the prevalence of pre-existing antibodies to PEG, treatment-emergent antibody response, and hypersensitivity reactions to PEGylated drugs. Seven studies reported pharmacological outcomes such as increased clearance and reduced activity in response to PEGylated drugs. This review aims to contribute to a balanced view of PEGylated therapies by summarizing the adverse outcomes or lack of benefit associated with PEGylated therapeutics reported in the literature. We identified several studies characterizing adverse outcomes, pharmacological effects, and immunogenicity associated with the use of PEGylated therapeutics.

In recent years, semiconductor companies in Taiwan have faced increasing inventory pressures, which will reduce their competitiveness and increase operational costs over the long term. Although previous studies have explored the influence of trade facilitation on macroeconomic and trade efficiencies, its specific impacts on the semiconductor industry have been less frequently addressed. This study integrates corporate inventory, trade facilitation, and geopolitical factors within a unified analytical framework to construct a model that explores mediating and moderating effects. This study conducted regression analysis on data from 52 Taiwan-listed integrated circuit companies from 2014 to 2022. Contrary to traditional findings that trade facilitation decreases inventory in other industries, it predominantly fosters inventory accumulation within Taiwan's semiconductor sector by expanding market size, thereby affecting supply chain efficiency. Moreover, geopolitical factors were found to intensify the effects of trade facilitation on corporate inventory. Elevated geopolitical risks lead to greater inventory accumulation, which ultimately threatens long-term competitiveness and diminishes the semiconductor industry's advantage in Taiwan, further influencing supply chain efficiency. Consequently, this study recommends that to more accurately forecast market size, semiconductor companies in Taiwan are encouraged to expand their manufacturing investments in Chinese mainland. Additionally, the prudent handling of cross-strait relations by the Taiwan authorities is an important strategy to mitigate geopolitical risks affecting the semiconductor supply chain.",,,

Psychological distress was assessed using the Kessler Psychological Distress Scale (K10) at baseline, 6 months, and 12 months. The primary endpoint was the presence of nonspecific psychological distress, as measured by the K10 scale at 6 months from the trial start, based on group randomization. A secondary exploratory analysis assessed psychological distress at baseline, 6 months, and 12 months for both groups, while controlling for group randomization and prognostic covariates. Prognostic covariates included age; comorbidities; time between diagnosis and randomization; treatment modality; relationship status; and use of prescribed medications for anxiety, depression, or both. An exploratory sub-analysis was conducted for the breast cancer subgroup, based on the sample size available after recruitment. The trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT05508412). The provision of the HRV biofeedback monitor in conjunction with the CancerPEP intervention did not significantly affect the primary outcome in either the full sample or the breast cancer subgroup, indicating that the HRV biofeedback provision was not beneficial in this trial. No self-reported or otherwise discovered adverse events at the 6-month mark were observed. About 10% of participants were lost to follow-up in both the early and late HRV monitor provision groups. Participation in the CancerPEP program led to a significant reduction in psychological distress over time. The odds of psychological distress were significantly higher at the start of the trial than at the end of the intervention (aOR = 2.64, 95% CI: 1.53-4.56) or 6 months after the intervention (aOR = 2.94, 95% CI: 1.62-5.30). Similarly, in the breast cancer subgroup, distress was higher at the trial's start than at 6 months, i.e., after the intervention (aOR = 2.25, 95% CI: 1.24-4.08), or at the end of the trial at 12 months (aOR = 2.73, 95% CI: 1.35-5.52). CancerPEP significantly reduces psychological distress in cancer patients, with consistent improvements noted across various cancer types and stages, including benefits specifically for breast cancer patients. These findings build upon the success of the Prostate Cancer Patient Empowerment Program (PC-PEP), indicating that a similar comprehensive intervention can be advantageous for all cancer patients and may be further tailored to address specific needs. With its holistic approach-encompassing physical, dietary, and psychosocial support-CancerPEP shows promise as a vital component of survivorship care. Ongoing 24-month evaluations will yield critical data on its long-term benefits. Additionally, a randomized trial with a control group (usual care without intervention) for breast cancer patients is currently under way and could potentially guide the integration of CancerPEP into standard oncology care to enhance patient outcomes and quality of life.",,,

The research and development of robotic walkers for individuals requiring walking support are advancing. However, there was a problem that the conventional constant support amount did not satisfy the propulsion force required for the walking speed that users wanted. In this study, in order to solve this problem, we propose an algorithm for determining the support amount to maintain the walking speed when the average walking speed of each user is set as the target speed. A robotic walker was developed by attaching BLDC motors to an actual walker, along with a control algorithm for assistance based on sampling-type PID control. The effectiveness of the assistance determination algorithm and the usefulness of the parameters were demonstrated through experiments using weights loaded on the forearm support and target speeds. Subsequently, subject experiments were conducted to verify the ability to maintain target speeds, and a questionnaire survey confirmed that the assistance did not interfere with actual walking. The proposed algorithm for determining the assistance levels demonstrated the ability to maintain target speeds and allowed for adjustments in the necessary level of assistance.",Mori M,SUNCREER Co.,

Results from an experimental-clinical study on a completely paralyzed person involved in communication sessions after the implantation of a microelectrode array were retrospectively analyzed. The aim was to focus on the prerequisites and determinants for learning to control a brain-computer interface for communication in paralysis. A comparative examination of the communication results with the current literature was carried out in light of an ideomotor theory of thinking. We speculate that novel skill learning took place and that several aspects of the wording of sentences during the communication sessions reflect preserved cognitive and conscious processing. We also present some speculations on the operant learning procedure used for communication, which argues for the reformulation of the previously postulated hypothesis of the extinction of response planning and goal-directed ideas in the completely locked-in state. We highlight the importance of feedback and reinforcement in the thought-action-consequence associative chain necessary to maintain purposeful communication. Finally, we underline the necessity to consider the psychosocial context of patients and the duration of complete immobilization as determinants of the 'extinction of thinking' theory and to identify the actual barriers preventing communication in these patients.",Occhigrossi C; Di Giorgi M,ALS Voice gGmbH,

Therefore, extensive research on the genesis of motion artifacts in EEG recordings is still needed to optimize existing technologies, shedding light on possible solutions to overcome the current limitations. We identified three potential sources of motion artifacts occurring at three different levels of a traditional biopotential acquisition chain: the skin-electrode interface, the connecting cables between the detection and the acquisition systems, and the electrode-amplifier system. The identified sources of motion artifacts were modelled starting from experimental observations carried out on EEG signals. Consequently, we designed customized EEG electrode systems aiming at experimentally disentangling the possible causes of motion artifacts. Both analytical and experimental observations indicated two main residual sites responsible for motion artifacts: the connecting cables between the electrodes and the amplifier and the sudden changes in electrode-skin impedance due to electrode movements. We concluded that further advancements in EEG technology should focus on the transduction stage of the biopotentials amplification chain, such as the electrode technology and its interfacing with the acquisition system.",,,

A hypothermically stored amniotic membrane (HSAM) was developed using a proprietary process to allow for the retention of the extracellular matrix (ECM), viable cells, and key proteins. To evaluate its utility, we characterized the HSAM and compared it to a native unprocessed amniotic membrane (uAM) and a dehydrated amniotic membrane (dAM), as well as assessing the functionality of the HSAM as a scaffold to promote cell growth. The HSAM, uAM, and dAM were compared using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), histology, and thickness. Scaffold durability was assessed in vitro using mechanical testing and a simulated wound fluid (SWF) model. The ability of the HSAM to act as a scaffold was evaluated using an in vitro attachment model. The HSAM showed similar structural characteristics compared to the uAM; however, the dAM was significantly more compact. There were no significant differences between the HSAM and the uAM following degradation in an SWF model. ECM- and placental-related proteins were shared between the HSAM and uAM, and the HSAM enhanced the attachment and proliferation of fibroblasts in vitro. The HSAM is substantially similar to the uAM by retaining key regulatory proteins, resisting degradation in SWF, and acting as a scaffold for cellular growth and invasion.",,,

Both methods successfully generated acellular matrices with less than 3 % residual DNA, effectively preserving structural and protein integrity. Scanning and transmission electron microscopy confirmed the ultrastructural integrity, whereas Masson's Trichrome staining highlighted better collagen preservation in frozen treatments. Proteomic analysis of decellularized scaffolds revealed collagen and key macromolecules such as laminin, filamin, dermatopontin, and fibronectin, which are essential for extracellular matrix structure and cell functions such as adhesion and migration. Innovatively, we assessed the biocompatibility and cytotoxicity of the scaffolds using spermatozoa, demonstrating that thorough washing ensures the scaffold biocompatibility without compromising sperm viability or motility.

The task of equipment improvement is especially challenging in sports including advanced manoeuvres such as ice hockey and requires a holistic approach guiding the researcher's attention toward the right variables. The purposes of this study were (a) to quantify the effects of protective equipment in ice hockey on player's performance and (b) to identify the restrictions incurred by it. Twenty male hockey players performed four different drills with and without protective equipment while their performance was quantified. A neural network accompanied by layer-wise relevance propagation was applied to the 3D kinematic data to identify variables and time points that were most relevant for the neural network to distinguish between the equipment and no equipment condition, and therefore presumable result from restrictions incurred by the protective equipment. The study indicated that wearing the protective equipment, significantly reduced performance. Further, using the 3D kinematics, an artificial neural network could accurately distinguish between the movements performed with and without the equipment. The variables contributing the most to distinguishing between the equipment conditions were related to the upper extremities and movements in the sagittal plane. The presented methodology consisting of artificial neural networks and layer-wise relevance propagation contributed to insights without prior knowledge of how and to which extent joint angles are affected in complex maneuvers in ice hockey in the presence of protective equipment. It was shown that changes to the equipment should support the flexion movements of the knee and hip and should allow players to keep their upper extremities closer to the torso.",Lennartz R; Eskofier BM,Machine Learning and Data Analytics Lab,

In addition, free radical generation is usually elevated in cells under stress as is the case for many different pathological conditions. In liver tissue, cells produce radicals when exposed to toxic substances but also, for instance, in cancer, alcoholic liver disease and liver cirrhosis. However, free radicals are small, short-lived, and occur in low abundance making them challenging to detect and especially to time resolve, leading to a lack of nanoscale information. Recently, our group has demonstrated that diamond-based quantum sensing offers a solution to measure free radical generation in single living cells. The method is based on defects in diamonds, the so-called nitrogen-vacancy centers, which change their optical properties based on their magnetic surrounding. As a result, this technique reveals magnetic resonance signals by optical means offering high sensitivity. However, compared to cells, there are several challenges that we resolved here: Tissues are more fragile, have a higher background fluorescence, have less particle uptake, and do not adhere to microscopy slides. Here, we overcame those challenges and adapted the method to perform measurements in living tissues. More specifically, we used precision-cut liver slices and were able to detect free radical generation during a stress response to ethanol, as well as the reduction in the radical load after adding an antioxidant.",,,
39399093,A comparative cadaveric biomechanical study of bilateral FacetFuse,,Journal of spine surgery (Hong Kong),10.21037/jss-24-10,"Achieving optimal immediate stability is crucial in lumbar fusion surgeries. Traditionally, four pedicle screws have been utilized to provide posterior stability at the L5-S1 level. However, the use of bilateral transfacet pedicle screws (TFPS) as an alternative construct has shown promising results in terms of biomechanical stability. This research paper investigates the biomechanical stability of TFPS with a lag design in comparison to equivalent-sized unilateral or bilateral fully threaded pedicle screw-rod (PSR) constructs at the L5-S1 disc level. The study assesses the immediate stability achieved by these constructs which have clinical implications in achieving lumbar segment fusion. We hypothesized that bilateral TFPS will yield immediate lumbar fixation that is comparable to unilateral or bilateral PSR constructs. Cadaveric biomechanical testing was conducted  Fourteen specimens were analyzed with an average age of 53.14±10.99 years and comparable bone mineral density. TFPS demonstrated a reduced ROM that was notably lower than that of unilateral PSR in all loading modes and was comparable to bilateral PSR, especially in extension and axial rotation (AR). The unilateral and bilateral PSR groups differed notably in lateral bending (LB) and AR. Bilateral TFPS demonstrated superior immediate stability than unilateral PSR and was an equivalent substitute to bilateral PSR constructs at the L5-S1 disc level. Further clinical investigations are necessary to validate these results and ascertain the long-term outcomes and advantages associated with the use of bilateral TFPS as an alternative construct.

39399071,Advancing the design of interspinous fixation devices for improved biomechanical performance: dual ,,Journal of spine surgery (Hong Kong),10.21037/jss-24-13,"Interspinous devices were introduced in the field of spine surgery as an alternative to traditional pedicle screw fixation in selected patients for treatment of spinal stenosis and fixation. These devices designs have evolved from non-fixated extension blocks to sophisticated interspinous fixation devices (IFDs). There is an absence of literature comparing the biomechanical fixation strength of different IFD plate designs and the role of set screw locking systems. The aim of this study was to evaluate fixation strengths by bench testing static disassembly and pullout strength of two dissimilar IFD designs and locking mechanisms. We hypothesized that the InSpan (InSpan LLC, Burlington, MA, USA) dual-locking symmetrically IFD plate designed will have stronger fixation than the Aspen (ZimVie, Parsippany, NJ, USA) single-locking asymmetric IFD plate design. We conducted two biomechanical bench tests to evaluate the load to failure locking characteristics of symmetrical InSpan and asymmetrical Aspen IFD designs. Static pullout testing involved locking each IFD to the stainless steel and 40 pcf cellular polyurethane foam and measuring pullout load and displacement six times. Seven InSpan and two Aspen IFDs (including the ""used"" IFDs from the pullout testing) underwent static disassembly tests using a pair of disassembly fixtures positioned between the IFD plates to measure disassembly force and displacement. All tests were performed under ambient conditions using an INSTRON 8874 Bi-Axial Tabletop Servohydraulic Dynamic Testing System (INSTRON, Norwood, MA, USA), and data was collected at a 0.2 mm/s displacement control rate until the test was stopped when there was a drop in the continuously increasing force against resistance (gross failure). The InSpan IFD experienced 94.81% higher resistance to pullout compared to the Aspen IFD in static pullout testing (P<0.05), owing to its notably larger footprint area of 69.8%. Gross failure for both IFD implant designs occurred at the foam block-block interface. In static disassembly testing, pristine InSpan required 60.7% higher force over pristine Aspen and 401.3% for ""used"" IFDs. Gross failure was characterized by the gradual distraction of the plates and material removal at the set screw contact points. Implant failure at the block-implant interface emphasized the pivotal role of teeth design and the contact surface area of the plates in ensuring stability. The dual-locking symmetrical InSpan IFD outperformed single-locking asymmetric Aspen IFD in both static disassembly and pullout bench tests. This highlights the benefits of InSpan's improved design and its potential for enhanced long-term stability in spinal fixation applications.",Lore V; Costigan WM; Pandey DK,Less Exposure Spine Surgery (LESS) Society 501©(3); LESSpine; Congress Orthopaedic Associates,

Physical therapy (PT) effectively complements pharmacological treatment to improve postural stability, gait performance, and other dopamine-resistant symptoms (e.g. festination, hesitation, axial motor dysfunctions, and FOG) in PwPD who are non-surgically treated. Despite the potential for positive adjuvant effects of PT following STN-DBS surgery, there is a paucity of science available on the topic. In such a scenario, gathering the opinion and expertise of leading investigators worldwide was pursued to study motor rehabilitation in PwPD following STN-DBS. After summarizing the few available findings through a systematic review, we identified clinical and academically experienced DBS clinicians (n=21) to discuss the challenges related to PT following STN-DBS. A 5-point Likert scale questionnaire was used and based on the results of the systematic review along with a Delphi method. Thirty-nine questions were submitted to the panel - half related to general considerations on PT following STN-DBS, half related to PT treatments. Despite the low-to-moderate quality, the few available rehabilitative studies suggested that PT could improve dynamic and static balance, gait performance and posture. Similarly, panellists strongly agreed that PT might help in improving motor symptoms and quality of life, and it may be possibly prescribed to maximize the effects of the stimulation. The experts agreed that physical therapists could be part of the multidisciplinary team taking care of the patients. Also, they agreed on prescribing of conventional PT, but not massage or manual therapy. Our results will inform the rehabilitation and the DBS community to engage, publish and deepen this area of research.

Research was conducted across NHS UK facilities, primarily within community services and outpatient leg ulcer clinics, encompassing a total of 51 patients. A partitioned survival model, based on a two-arm randomised controlled trial, assessed wound healing rates using Kaplan-Meier curves and parametric extrapolations over a 12-month time horizon. Costs were derived from UK reference costs the British National Formulary, and the Personal Social Services Research Unit (2021/22). The primary outcome measured was the incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year gained. The geko device provides additional benefits by stimulating the lateral popliteal nerve, augmenting venous, arterial, and microvascular flow. The addition of the geko device to SoC significantly enhanced outcomes, increasing healing probability by 68% compared to SoC. This integration would result in a cost saving of £774.14 per patient when compared to the SoC alone across the NHS. Economic analyses indicate that integrating the geko device into SoC protocols would reduce the overall NHS expenditure on VLU wound management by as much as 15%. The approach also positively impacted health-related quality of life.

Here we propose a phantom design to address this need. A mixture of styrene-butylene/ethylene-styrene (SEBS) in mineral oil and glass beads as a scattering material acted as a bulk material, in which a polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) inclusion containing magnetic nanoparticles in water solution and graphite was embedded. The design mimics nanoparticle-laden lymph nodes embedded in mesorectal fat, as would be the clinical scenario for diagnostic support of staging rectal cancer using magnetomotive ultrasound. The estimated reflection between the insert and bulk material was 10%, matching the clinical case of a lymph node within fat (9%). Speed of sound, attenuation, and Young's modulus of the bulk material were matched with those of body fat. The insert also matched the acoustic and elastic properties of lymph node tissue except for attenuation, which was lower than that given in the literature. Glass beads and graphite were used to control backscatter levels in the respective tissue mimics, providing a contrast of -3.8 dB that was consistent with clinical image appearance. The magnitude of magnetomotion remained stable in three separate samples over the course of 3 weeks. We have developed a phantom for magnetomotive ultrasound that combines the stability of an oil-based bulk material with the necessity of using a water-based material for the insert.

Cardiovascular interventions,10.1016/j.jcin.2024.07.009,"Vascular complications remain a major concern in transfemoral transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). The Hostile score has been proposed to stratify risk in TAVR patients with peripheral artery disease. The authors aimed to assess the validity of the Hostile score in predicting iliofemoral vascular complications after TAVR. In a prospective TAVR registry, we validated the Hostile score for the prediction of puncture and non-puncture site vascular complications. This scoring system integrates the extent (number of lesions, lesion length, and minimum lumen diameter) and complexity (tortuosity, calcification, and the presence of obstruction) of iliofemoral atherosclerosis. Of 2,023 patients who underwent transfemoral TAVR with contemporary devices between March 2014 and June 2022, 106 (5.2%) patients experienced puncture site vascular complications and 28 (1.4%) patients experienced non-puncture site vascular complications. The Hostile score was higher in patients with vascular complications than those without complications (1.00 [Q1-Q3: 0-5.00] vs 1.00 [Q1-Q3: 0-4.00]; P < .001).

Understanding these events is essential toward the design and development of suitable antiviral drugs and/or vaccines. Viral capture involves dynamic interactions of the virus with specific receptors in the plasma membrane of the target cells. In the last years, single virus tracking has emerged as a powerful approach to assess real time dynamics of viral processes in living cells and their engagement with specific cellular components. However, direct visualization of the early steps of multireceptor viral interactions at the single level has been largely impeded by the technical challenges associated with imaging individual multimolecular systems at relevant spatial (nanometer) and temporal (millisecond) scales. Here, we present a four-color, high-density quantum dot spatiotemporal mapping methodology to capture real-time interactions between individual virus-like-particles (VLPs) and three different viral (co-) receptors on the membrane of primary living immune cells derived from healthy donors. Together with quantitative tools, our approach revealed the existence of a coordinated spatiotemporal diffusion of the three different (co)receptors prior to viral engagement. By varying the temporal-windows of cumulated single-molecule localizations, we discovered that such a concerted diffusion impacts on the residence time of HIV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 VLPs on the host membrane and potential viral infectivity. Overall, our methodology offers the possibility for systematic analysis of the initial steps of viral-host interactions and could be easily implemented for the investigation of other multimolecular systems at the single-molecule level.",,,

As of July 1, 2021, pharmaceutical and medical device companies must publicly report all payments to APRNs through the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services' Open Payments website. To gauge APRNs' familiarity with, and perceptions of the Open Payments database and discuss whether and how APRNs should respond. Virtual workshops consisting of a didactic presentation and interactive exercises with APRNs recruited through professional networks, associations, and conferences. Transcripts were analyzed using a qualitative interpretive approach, grounded in an everyday ethics theoretical framework. Thirty-six APRN clinicians, students, and faculty participated in nine workshops. Seeing sponsored meals reported in Open Payments as ""payments"" prompted participants to see familiar interactions in a new way. Participants valued the enhanced transparency as a way to identify risks of bias but were concerned that reporting might undermine public trust in APRNs. Emphasizing awareness as a precursor to action, participants desired greater preparation for ensuring independence in practice. The importance of tackling the ethical issues associated with industry interactions is heightened within the context of an existing climate of distrust within health care. However, many participants were concerned about the effects of transparency on public trust rather than how APRNs individually or collectively can be more trustworthy. Open Payments can serve as a useful tool to catalyze broader conversations about ethics, integrity in decision making, and health policy advocacy.",,,

To analyze the efficacy and safety of DAPT strategies in patients with ACS using a bayesian network meta-analysis. MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane, and LILACS databases were searched from inception to April 8, 2024. Randomized clinical trials (RCTs) comparing DAPT duration strategies in patients with ACS undergoing PCI were selected. Short-term strategies (1 month of DAPT followed by P2Y12 inhibitors, 3 months of DAPT followed by P2Y12 inhibitors, 3 months of DAPT followed by aspirin, and 6 months of DAPT followed by aspirin) were compared with conventional 12 months of DAPT. This systematic review and network meta-analysis followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis guidelines. The risk ratio (RR) with a 95% credible interval (CrI) was calculated within a bayesian random-effects network meta-analysis. Treatments were ranked using surface under the cumulative ranking (SUCRA). The primary efficacy end point was major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events (MACCE); the primary safety end point was major bleeding. A total of 15 RCTs randomizing 35 326 patients (mean [SD] age, 63.1 [11.1] years; 26 954 male [76.3%]; 11 339 STEMI [32.1%]) with ACS were included. A total of 24 797 patients (70.2%) received potent P2Y12 inhibitors (ticagrelor or prasugrel). Compared with 12 months of DAPT, 1 month of DAPT followed by P2Y12 inhibitors reduced major bleeding (RR, 0.47; 95% CrI, 0.26-0.74) with no difference in MACCE (RR, 1.00; 95% CrI, 0.70-1.41). No significant differences were observed in MACCE incidence between strategies, although CrIs were wide. SUCRA ranked 1 month of DAPT followed by P2Y12 inhibitors as the best for reducing major bleeding and 3 months of DAPT followed by P2Y12 inhibitors as optimal for reducing MACCE (RR, 0.85; 95% CrI, 0.56-1.21). Results of this systematic review and network meta-analysis reveal that, in patients with ACS undergoing PCI with DES, 1 month of DAPT followed by potent P2Y12 inhibitor monotherapy was associated with a reduction in major bleeding without increasing MACCE when compared with 12 months of DAPT. However, an increased risk of MACCE cannot be excluded, and 3 months of DAPT followed by potent P2Y12 inhibitor monotherapy was ranked as the best option to reduce MACCE. Because most patients receiving P2Y12 inhibitor monotherapy were taking ticagrelor, the safety of stopping aspirin in those taking clopidogrel remains unclear.",,,

To determine whether women with small aortic annuli undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement have better clinical and hemodynamic outcomes with a self-expanding valve (SEV) or balloon-expandable valve (BEV). The Small Annuli Randomized to Evolut or SAPIEN Trial (SMART) was a large-scale randomized clinical trial focusing on patients with small aortic annuli undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement, randomized to receive SEVs or BEVs and included 716 patients treated at 83 centers in Canada, Europe, Israel, and the US from April 2021 to October 2022. This prespecified secondary analysis reports clinical and hemodynamic findings for all 621 women enrolled in SMART. Data for this report were analyzed from February to April 2024. Transcatheter aortic valve replacement with an SEV or a BEV. The composite coprimary clinical end point comprised death, disabling stroke, or heart failure-related rehospitalization. The coprimary valve function end point was the incidence of bioprosthetic valve dysfunction, both assessed through 12 months. Secondary end points included the incidence of moderate or severe prosthesis-patient mismatch. A total of 621 women (mean [SD] age, 80.2 [6.2] years; 312 randomized to the SEV group and 309 to the BEV group) were included in the present analysis. At 12 months, there were no significant differences in the coprimary clinical end point between the SEV and BEV groups (9.4% vs 11.8%, absolute risk difference -2.3%; 95% CI -7.2 to 2.5, P = .35). However, SEV implantation was associated with less bioprosthetic valve dysfunction (8.4% vs 41.8%; absolute risk difference, -33.4%; 95% CI, -40.4 to -26.4; P < .001). SEV implantation resulted in lower aortic valve gradients and larger effective orifice areas at 30 days and 12 months and less mild or greater aortic regurgitation at 12 months compared to BEV implantation. Prosthesis-patient mismatch was significantly lower with SEVs, regardless of the definition used and adjustment for body mass index. Use of SEVs was associated with better quality of life outcomes as assessed by the Valve Academic Research Consortium-3 ordinal quality of life measure. Among women with severe symptomatic aortic stenosis and small aortic annuli undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement, the use of SEVs, compared to BEVs, resulted in similar clinical outcomes and a markedly reduced incidence of bioprosthetic valve dysfunction through 12 months, including a lower risk of prosthesis-patient mismatch and better 12-month quality of life.

This related paper describes how people with lived experience of stroke-related perceptual disorders contributed to and influenced the project, and identifies lessons for future review projects. We planned our patient and public involvement and engagement (PPIE) activities within a study protocol, described according to the domains of the ACTIVE framework; these were founded on principles for good practice in PPIE. Activities occurred across the lifespan of the project, consisting primarily of group discussions and voting to determine if there was consensus. To assess impact and individual experiences, we sought feedback using an evaluation form after each discussion, and conducted an online meeting at the end of the project to allow further reflection. We recruited five people to a Lived Experience Group, including two stroke survivors and three carers. Members attended one face-to-face meeting during the development of the review. Subsequent activities were all held online due to the COVID-19 pandemic; with six online meetings, plus email interactions. Positive impacts of the Lived Experience Group on the reviews included clear definitions of key terms, selection of outcome measures, agreement on implications of review findings, and identification of research recommendations. Key challenges identified related to the complexity of the topic and challenges in the use of new online technology as a consequence of the COVID-pandemic. A number of lessons were learned during this project. Specific recommendations for future PPIE are to ensure that those involved have an opportunity to get to know one another, and to provide optional sessions to increase familiarity with online meeting software, clear explanations of the purpose of involvement and specific feedback after each activity. These lessons should be considered when planning the PPIE within future reviews.",Nicolson DJ,Stakeholder representative,Katie.thomson@gcu.ac.uk.

This study explored the utility of the Morphologically-Directed Raman Spectroscopy (MDRS) and dissolution as orthogonal techniques to assess microstructural equivalence of the aerosolized dose of DPIs collected with an aerosol collection device. Commercial DPIs containing different strengths of Fluticasone Propionate (FP) and Salmeterol Xinafoate (SX) as monotherapy and combination products were sourced from different regions. These inhalers were compared with aerodynamic particle size distribution (APSD), dissolution, and MDRS studies. APSD testing alone might not be able to explain differences reported elsewhere in in vivo studies of commercial FP/SX drug products with different Advair® strengths and/or batches. Dissolution studies demonstrated different dissolution rates between Seretide™ 100/50 and Advair® 100/50, whereas Flixotide™ 100 and Flovent® 100 had similar dissolution rates between each other. These differences in dissolution profiles were supported by MDRS results: the dissolution rate is increased if the fraction of FP associated with high soluble components is increased. Principle component analysis was used to identify the agglomerate classes that better discriminate different products. MDRS and dissolution studies of the aerosolized dose of DPIs were successfully used as orthogonal techniques. This study highlights the importance of further assessing in vitro tools that are able to provide a bridge between material attributes or process parameters and in vivo performance.",,,goncalo.farias01@aptar.com.

Noncontrast computed tomographic (CT) scan is the most common stroke imaging approach. It remains uncertain whether thrombectomy is effective for patients with large infarcts identified using noncontrast CT alone within 24 hours of stroke onset. To evaluate the effect of thrombectomy in patients with a large infarct on a noncontrast CT scan within 24 hours of onset. Open-label, blinded-end point, bayesian-adaptive randomized trial with interim analyses for early stopping (futility or success) or population enrichment, which was conducted at 47 US academic and community-based stroke thrombectomy centers. Three hundred patients presenting within 24 hours with anterior-circulation, large-vessel occlusion and large infarct on noncontrast CT scan, with Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Scores of 2 to 5, were randomized to undergo thrombectomy or usual care. Enrollment occurred July 16, 2019 to October 17, 2022; final follow-up, January 25, 2023. The intervention patients (n = 152) underwent endovascular treatment using standard thrombectomy devices and usual medical care. Control patients (n = 148) underwent usual medical care alone. The primary efficacy end point was improvement in 90-day functional outcome measured using mean utility-weighted modified Rankin Scale (UW-mRS) scores (range, 0 [death or severe disability] to 10 [no symptoms]; minimum clinically important difference, 0.3). A bayesian model determined the posterior probability that the intervention would be superior to usual care; statistical significance was a 1-sided posterior probability of .975 or more. The primary adverse event end point was 90-day mortality; secondary adverse event end points included symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage and radiographic intracranial hemorrhage. The trial enrolled 300 patients (152 intervention, 148 control; 138 females [46%]; median age, 67 years), without early stopping or enrichment; 297 patients completed the 90-day follow-up. The mean (SD) 90-day UW-mRS score was 2.93 (3.39) for the intervention group vs 2.27 (2.98) for the control group with an adjusted difference of 0.63 (95% credible interval [CrI], -0.09 to 1.34; posterior probability for superiority of thrombectomy, .96). The 90-day mortality was similar between groups: 35.3% (53 of 150) for the intervention group vs 33.3% (49 of 147) for the control group. Six of 151 patients (4.0%) in the intervention group and 2 of 149 (1.3%) in the control group experienced 24-hour symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage. Fourteen patients of 148 (9.5%) in the intervention group vs 4 of 146 (2.7%) in the control group experienced parenchymal hematoma type 1 hemorrhages; 14 (9.5%) in the intervention group vs 5 (3.4%) in the control group experienced parenchymal hematoma type 2 hemorrhages; and 24 (16.2%) in the intervention group vs 9 (6.2%) in the control group experienced subarachnoid hemorrhages. Among patients with a large infarct on noncontrast CT within 24 hours, thrombectomy did not demonstrate improvement in functional outcomes. But the width of the credible interval around the effect estimate includes the possibility of both no important effect and a clinically relevant benefit, so the potential role of thrombectomy with this imaging approach and time window will likely require additional study.

Clinical guidelines recommend discontinuing benzodiazepine receptor agonist hypnotics (particularly in older adults) and administering cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBTI) as first-line therapy for insomnia. It is unknown whether a novel intervention that masks the daily dose of benzodiazepine receptor agonist during tapering and augments CBTI with novel cognitive and behavioral exercises targeting placebo effect mechanisms improves benzodiazepine receptor agonist discontinuation. To compare a masked benzodiazepine receptor agonist taper plus augmented CBTI vs an unmasked taper plus standard CBTI. This randomized clinical trial conducted at an academic medical center and a Department of Veterans Affairs medical center included adults aged 55 years or older who had used lorazepam, alprazolam, clonazepam, temazepam, and/or zolpidem for current or prior insomnia, at doses of less than 8-mg diazepam-equivalent 2 or more nights per week for at least 3 months. Data were collected between December 2018 and November 2023. Data analyses were conducted between November 2023 and July 2024.

The primary efficacy outcome was percentage achieving benzodiazepine receptor agonist discontinuation 6 months after treatment ended (6-month; intention-to-treat) measured with 7-day self-reported medication logs and for a subset, urine tests. Secondary outcomes were Insomnia Severity Index scores at 1 week posttreatment and 6 months posttreatment, percentage of participants that have discontinued benzodiazepine receptor agonist use at 1 week posttreatment, and benzodiazepine receptor agonist dose and the Dysfunctional Beliefs About Sleep-Medication subscale at 1 week and 6 months posttreatment.

39373185,Effects of epileptic seizures on the quality of biosignals recorded from wearables.,2024-12-16,Epilepsia,10.1111/epi.18138,"Wearable nonelectroencephalographic biosignal recordings captured from the wrist offer enormous potential for seizure monitoring. However, signal quality remains a challenging factor affecting data reliability. Models trained for seizure detection depend on the quality of recordings in peri-ictal periods in performing a feature-based separation of ictal periods from interictal periods. Thus, this study aims to investigate the effect of epileptic seizures on signal quality, ensuring accurate and reliable monitoring. This study assesses the signal quality of wearable data during peri-ictal phases of generalized tonic-clonic and focal to bilateral tonic-clonic seizures (TCS), focal motor seizures (FMS), and focal nonmotor seizures (FNMS). We evaluated accelerometer (ACC) activity and the signal quality of electrodermal activity (EDA) and blood volume pulse (BVP) data. Additionally, we analyzed the influence of peri-ictal movements as assessed by ACC (ACC activity) on signal quality and examined intraictal subphases of focal to bilateral TCS. We analyzed 386 seizures from 111 individuals in three international epilepsy monitoring units. BVP signal quality and ACC activity levels differed between all seizure types. We found the largest decrease in BVP signal quality and increase in ACC activity when comparing the ictal phase to the pre- and postictal phases for TCS. Additionally, ACC activity was strongly negatively correlated with BVP signal quality for TCS and FMS, and weakly for FNMS. Intraictal analysis revealed that tonic and clonic subphases have the lowest BVP signal quality and the highest ACC activity. Motor elements of seizures significantly impair BVP signal quality, but do not have significant effect on EDA signal quality, as assessed by wrist-worn wearables. The results underscore the importance of signal quality assessment methods and careful selection of robust modalities to ensure reliable seizure detection. Future research is needed to explain whether seizure detection models' decisions are based on signal responses induced by physiological processes as opposed to artifacts.",Brinkmann BH,Department of Neurology and Physiology and Biomedical Engineering,

The goal of this study is to report outcomes on patient satisfaction at least 6 months after Penuma subcutaneous penile implant for cosmetic enhancement of the penis, and to determine if modifications in surgical approach resulted in reduction in postoperative complications. Penile measurements, adverse events, and patient satisfaction were compared between patients undergoing the new lateral scrotal incision versus the traditional infrapubic approach. A retrospective chart review was performed on all patients who underwent a Penuma implant by a single surgeon from April 2019 to December 2022. A 26-item non-validated device-specific questionnaire was sent to patients at least 6 months after the date of their initial surgery. A total of 92 cases were performed by a single surgeon. The average increase in flaccid length was 2.5 cm (±2.2), representing a 44% increase ( The subcutaneous Penuma penile implant appears to improve satisfaction with regard to the appearance of the penis and is a viable option for men who desire to enhance flaccid penile length and girth. Furthermore, the lateral scrotal surgical approach appears to have a lower postoperative complication rate.",,,

However, it is unclear whether the torn labrum prompts mast cell (MC) activation, resulting in synovial inflammatory responses that lead to labral tissue degeneration. To determine the potential influence of activated MC on synovial inflammatory responses and subsequent labral tissue degeneration and shoulder function deterioration in a rat model by monitoring MC behavior and sequential inflammatory responses within the synovial tissue and labral tissue after injury, suture repair, and MC stabilizer administration. Controlled laboratory study. Anteroinferior glenoid labral tears were generated in the right shoulder of rats (n = 20) and repaired using a tunneled suture technique. Synovial tissue inflammatory responses were modulated in some rats with intraperitoneal administration of an MC stabilizer-cromolyn (n = 10). At weeks 1 and 3, MC activation, synovial inflammatory responses, and labral degeneration were histologically evaluated. Simultaneously, gait analysis was performed before and after surgical repair to assess the worsening of the shoulder function after the injury and treatment. Resident MC degranulation after labral injury (50.48% ± 8.23% activated at week 1) contributed to the initiation of synovial tissue inflammatory cell recruitment, inflammatory product release, matrix metalloproteinase-13, and subsequent labral tissue extracellular matrix degeneration. The administration of cromolyn, an MC stabilizer, was found to significantly diminish injury-mediated inflammatory responses (inflammatory cell infiltration and subsequent proinflammatory product secretion) and improve shoulder functional recovery. MC activation is responsible for labral tear-associated synovial inflammation and labral degeneration. The administration of cromolyn can significantly diminish the cascade of inflammatory reactions after labral injury. Our findings support the concept that MC stabilizers may be used as a complementary therapeutic option in the treatment and repair of labral tears.",Millett PJ,Department of Orthopedic Surgery,

We assessed the impact of dynamic compression system bracing on quality of life in patients with pectus carinatum. We conducted a prospective cohort study on patients aged 10-21 years. We assessed quality of life using the Child Health Questionnaire-87, the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory-6, the World Health Organization Quality of Life-BREF, the 36-Item Short Form Survey, and the Single-Step Questionnaire adapted for pectus carinatum. Between March 2013 and March 2016, 225 patients treated with dynamic compression system bracing were included. Patients showed improvements across the overall scores of the 36-Item Short Form Survey (Δ7.7 (2.9-12.4)), Single-Step Questionnaire (Δ4.1 (2.0-6.3)) and three out of four World Health Organization Quality of Life-BREF domains (physical health (Δ8.7 (3.7-13.7)), psychological health (Δ11.8 (6.1-17.5)), environment (Δ5.7 (0.2-11.3))). No changes across the Child Health Questionnaire-87 overall score were observed (Δ5.5 (-0.5-11.5)). Most improvement occurred within six to twelve months after treatment initiation, stabilizing thereafter. Anxiety scores on the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory-6 did not improve (Δ0.5 (-0.1-1.2)).

The two elastic parameters are the shear modulus, related to deformation of shape, and what we in the paper define as the nonlinear compressibility, related to deformation of volume. We prepared tissue-mimicking phantoms containing lesions of variable shear modulus and variable nonlinear compressibility. An in-house framework for shear wave imaging was developed using ultrasound radiation force at 4.5 MHz to induce shear waves and plane wave imaging with pulses in a frequency band centered around 12.5 MHz to track the shear waves. For measurements of nonlinear compressibility, co-propagating dual-frequency pulse complexes at 0.7 MHz and 14 MHz were applied. Algorithms were implemented on a Verasonics Vantage ultrasound scanner and a custom-made multi-frequency ultrasound transducer was used. Mechanical indentation measurements were performed to validate ultrasound measurements of the shear modulus. For the nonlinear compressibility, ultrasound measurements were compared to results derived from the literature. We found good agreement in elasticity results from ultrasound measurements and mechanical indentation as well as when comparing with results derived from the literature. Results of the current investigation were promising. We plan patient studies involving thyroid lesions and liver steatosis to explore whether measurements of elastic parameters related both to shape deformation and volume deformation are useful in clinical practice.",Amini N; Solberg S; Berg S,Department of Health Research; SURF Technology AS,Rune.Hansen@sintef.no.

Oncology,10.1016/S1470-2045(24)00456-X,"Use of fine-needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) specimens on Xpert Breast Cancer STRAT4 Assay (STRAT4; Cepheid, Sunnyvale, CA, USA), a CE-marked in-vitro diagnostic medical device, could potentially increase access to breast cancer biomarker testing in resource-constrained settings. We aimed to assess the performance of a research use-only version of STRAT4 using FNAB specimens in Tanzania. In this prospective diagnostic accuracy study, patients aged 18 years or older with palpable breast masses presenting to the FNAB Clinic at Muhimbili National Hospital (Dar es Salaam, Tanzania) were recruited consecutively. Patients who were pregnant, lactating, or had a previous diagnosis of breast cancer were excluded. STRAT4 testing was performed on off-label FNAB samples using four protocols: the 1 × protocol (using the standard lysate method) on FNAB smears (1 × FNAB), quick lysis and Maui protocols (both on FNAB smears), and the 1 × protocol on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) cell block material (1 × cell block). For 1 × FNAB and 1 × cell block, tissue was processed using FFPE lysis reagent, incubated at 80°C with proteinase K, and followed by addition of 95% or higher ethanol. Quick lysis was processed using FFPE lysis reagent and 95% or higher ethanol, whereas Maui was processed using a proprietary research-use only lysis reagent. The primary outcomes were overall concordance, sensitivity, specificity, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of STRAT4 as compared with immunohistochemistry or immunohistochemistry plus fluorescence in-situ hybridisation performed on cell blocks using clinically validated protocols in a Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments-accredited laboratory at the University of California, San Francisco (San Francisco, CA, USA). Between Nov 29, 2017, and Dec 17, 2020, 208 patients were enrolled. Of 208 cases, 51 (25%) were excluded from analysis because of insufficient tissue in the cell block or absent cell blocks, leaving 157 participants (all female) for analysis. For oestrogen receptor, 1 × FNAB had the best performance, with an overall concordance of 95% (95% CI 90-100), sensitivity of 94% (85-100), specificity of 97% (90-100), and AUC of 0·96 (0·81-1·00). For progesterone receptor, 1 × cell block had the best overall performance (overall concordance 89% [95% CI 84-95], sensitivity 91% [82-99], and specificity 89% [81-97], with an AUC of 0·93 [0·89-0·99]) and 1 × FNAB performed the best among the smear protocols, with a concordance of 84% (95% CI 74-93), sensitivity of 63% (43-82), specificity of 97% (92-100), and AUC of 0·91 (0·72-0·97). For HER2, Maui had the highest agreement, with an overall concordance of 93% (95% CI 89-98), sensitivity of 96% (88-100), specificity of 92% (87-98), and AUC of 0·95 (0·98-1·00). For Ki67, Maui had the best performance of smear protocols, with a concordance of 73% (95% CI 64-82), sensitivity of 70% (58-81), specificity of 81% (66-96), and AUC of 0·80 (0·54-0·82).

However, previous methods lack the temporal resolution to detect rapid modulation of these maps, particularly in naturalistic conditions. To address this limitation, we previously developed a rapid stimulation mapping procedure with implanted cortical surface electrodes. In this study, employing our previously established procedure, we examined rapid topographical changes in forelimb M1 motor maps in three awake male marmoset monkeys. The results revealed that although the hotspot (the location in M1 that elicited a forelimb muscle twitch with the lowest stimulus intensity) remained constant across postures, the stimulus intensity required to elicit the forelimb muscle twitch in the perihotspot region and the size of motor representations were posture-dependent. Hindlimb posture was particularly effective in inducing these modulations. The angle of the body axis relative to the gravitational vertical line did not alter the motor maps. These results provide a proof of concept that a rapid stimulation mapping system with chronically implanted cortical electrodes can capture the dynamic regulation of forelimb motor maps in natural conditions. Moreover, they suggest that posture is a crucial variable to be controlled in future studies of motor control and cortical plasticity. Further exploration is warranted into the neural mechanisms regulating forelimb muscle representations in M1 by the hindlimb sensorimotor state.",Ansaldo A,Graphene Labs,atsushi.iriki@riken.jp.

To decrease the workload of skilled dental technicians, various computer vision models have been used to generate realistic occlusal crown depth images with definite crown surface structures that can ultimately be reconstructed to three-dimensional crowns and directly used in patient treatment. However, it has remained difficult to generate images of the structure of dental crowns in a fluid position using computer vision models. In this paper, we propose a two-stage model for generating depth images of occlusal crowns in diverse positions. The model is divided into two parts: segmentation and inpainting to obtain both shape and surface structure accuracy. The segmentation network focuses on the position and size of the crowns, which allows the model to adapt to diverse targets. The inpainting network based on a GAN generates curved structures of the crown surfaces based on the target jaw image and a binary mask made by the segmentation network. The performance of the model is evaluated via quantitative metrics for the area detection and pixel-value metrics. Compared to the baseline model, the proposed method reduced the MSE score from 0.007001 to 0.002618 and increased DICE score from 0.9333 to 0.9648. It indicates that the model showed better performance in terms of the binary mask from the addition of the segmentation network and the internal structure through the use of inpainting networks. Also, the results demonstrated an improved ability of the proposed model to restore realistic details compared to other models.",Kim J,Steinfeld Co.,jiminlee@unist.ac.kr.

About 11 per cent of eyes undergoing cataract surgery have non-dilating, small pupils. The increasing prevalence of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), hypertension, diabetes and medications used for the same are the contributing factors. The recent Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for the use of miotic agents in the treatment of presbyopia will lead to a further rise in the number of non-dilating pupils. While pharmacological agents and other methods have been used, mechanical pupil expander devices are the only fail safe option.

Manufacturers concluded root cause to be device failure in 8.9%. 29% of issues occurred before the laser had been activated. 5.2% of cases had to be cancelled as a result of an event. Significantly more injuries were sustained intra-operatively by operating staff compared to patients (6% vs. 0.2%, p < 0.001). All these injuries were superficial burns to the skin with the hand being the most affected body part (88.1%). Zero ocular injuries were reported. Only eight events were related to laser machines and all involved sudden hardware failure but no patient injury. Laser fibers are fragile. Most adverse events are due to operator error. Direct patient injury from laser fiber is scarce but operating staff should be aware of the risk of sustaining minor burns. Laser machines rarely incur problems and, in this study, did not result in any safety issues beyond need to abort the procedure due to lack of spare equipment.",De Coninck V,Department of Urology,jonesurology@gmail.com.

However, to prevent/treat dementia effectively, we require biomarkers for non-AD neuropathologies; for this, neuropathologic examinations and annotated tissue samples are essential. We conducted clinicopathologic correlation for the first 100 Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) Neuropathology Core (NPC) cases. Clinical syndromes in this cohort showed 95% sensitivity and 79% specificity for predicting high/intermediate ADNC, a 21% false positive rate, and a ∼44% false negative rate. In addition, 60% with high/intermediate ADNC harbored additional potentially dementing co-pathologies. These results suggest that clinical presentation imperfectly predicts ADNC and that accurate prediction of high/intermediate ADNC does not exclude co-pathology that may modify presentation, biomarkers, and therapeutic responses. Therefore, new biomarkers are needed for non-AD neuropathologies. The ADNI NPC supports this mission with well-characterized tissue samples (available through ADNI and the National Institute on Aging) and ""gold-standard"" diagnostic information (soon to include digital histology). The Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) Neuropathology Core (NPC) brain donation cohort now exceeds 200 cases. ADNI NPC data in National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center format are available through the Laboratory of Neuro Imaging. Digitized slide files from the ADNI NPC will be available in 2025. Requests for ADNI brain tissue samples can be submitted online for ADNI/National Institute on Aging evaluation. Clinical diagnoses of Alzheimer's disease (AD)/AD and related dementias (ADRD) do not always predict post mortem neuropathology. Neuropathology is essential for the development of novel AD/ADRD biomarkers.",,,

Here, we investigated the 10-year clinical outcomes of patients undergoing DES-PCI according to clinical presentation. Patient-level data from five randomized trials with 10-year follow-up after DES-PCI were pooled. Patients were dichotomized into acute coronary syndrome (ACS) or chronic coronary syndrome (CCS) groups as per clinical presentation. The primary outcome was all-cause death. Secondary outcomes were cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction (MI), definite stent thrombosis (ST) and repeat revascularization involving the target lesion (TLR), target vessel (TVR) or non-target vessel (nTVR). Of the 9700 patients included in this analysis, 4557 presented with ACS and 5143 with CCS. Compared with CCS patients, ACS patients had a higher risk of all-cause death and nTVR in the first year, but comparable risk thereafter. In addition, ACS patients had a higher risk of MI [adjusted hazard ratio 1.21, 95% confidence interval (1.04-1.41)] and definite ST [adjusted hazard ratio 1.48, 95% confidence interval (1.14-1.92)], while the risk of TLR and TVR was not significantly different up to 10-year follow-up. Compared to CCS patients, ACS patients treated with PCI and DES implantation have an increased risk of all-cause death and repeat revascularization of remote vessels up to 1 year, with no significant differences thereafter and up to 10-year follow-up. ACS patients have a consistently higher risk of MI and definite ST. Whether these differences persist with current antithrombotic and secondary prevention therapies requires further investigation.",Starnecker F; Kufner S; Kastrati A; Cassese S,Klinik für Herz- und Kreislauferkrankungen,

To support the use and advancement of these resources, a comprehensive overview of the current technological landscape is essential. A multi-stakeholder working group, convened by the Digital Medicine Society (DiMe), conducted a landscape review to identify digital health technologies for Alzheimer's disease and related dementia populations. We searched studies indexed in PubMed, Embase, and APA PsycInfo to identify manuscripts published between May 2003 to May 2023 reporting analytical validation, clinical validation, or usability/feasibility results for relevant digital health technologies. Additional technologies were identified through community outreach. We collated peer-reviewed manuscripts, poster presentations, or regulatory documents for 106 different technologies for Alzheimer's disease and related dementia assessment covering diverse populations such as Lewy Body, vascular dementias, frontotemporal dementias, and all severities of Alzheimer's disease. Wearable sensors represent 32% of included technologies, non-wearables 61%, and technologies with components of both account for the remaining 7%. Neurocognition is the most prevalent concept of interest, followed by physical activity and sleep. Clinical validation is reported in 69% of evidence, analytical validation in 34%, and usability/feasibility in 20% (not mutually exclusive).

This observation has sparked vast interest in deciphering the potentially lifesaving and morbidity-reducing mechanisms involved in neonatal cardiac regeneration. In mice, the regenerative potential is lost within the first week of life and coincides with a reduction of Insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (Igf1r) expression in the heart. Igf1r is a well-known regulator of cardiomyocyte maturation and proliferation in neonatal mice. To test the role of Igf1r as a pivotal factor in cardiac regeneration, we knocked down (KD) Igf1r specifically in cardiomyocytes using recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV) delivery and troponin T promotor driven shRNAmirs. Cardiomyocyte specific Igf1r KD versus control mice were subjected to experimental MI by permanent ligation of the left anterior descending artery (LAD). Cardiac functional and morphological data were analyzed over a 21-day period. Neonatal Igf1r KD mice showed reduced systolic cardiac function and increased fibrotic cardiac remodeling 21 days post injury. This cardiac phenotype was associated with reduced cardiomyocyte nuclei mitosis and decreased AKT and ERK phosphorylation in Igf1r KD, compared to control neonatal mouse hearts. Our in vivo murine data show that Igf1r KD shifts neonatal cardiac regeneration to a more adult-like scarring phenotype, identifying cardiomyocyte-specific Igf1r signaling as a crucial component of neonatal cardiac regeneration.",,,josef.penninger@helmholtz-hzi.de.

Prospective, observational, multicentre study. Nine European countries, involving 14 centres. General patient population. PowerPICC catheter inserted by the clinician as standard of care with routinely collected outcomes followed through device removal or 180 days postinsertion. Safety and performance outcomes were assessed for PowerPICC, PowerPICC SOLO 2 and PowerGroshong PICC. The primary safety endpoint was the incidence of symptomatic venous thrombosis (VT), and secondary safety endpoints included phlebitis, extravasation, vessel laceration, vessel perforation local infection, accidental dislodgment and catheter-related bloodstream infection (CRBSI). The primary performance endpoint was the percentage of patients whose PowerPICC device remained in place through the completion of therapy. The secondary performance endpoints included catheter patency, placement success in a single attempt and usability. The enrolled patients (N=451) received either PowerPICC, PowerPICC SOLO 2 or PowerGroshong PICC catheters. Across all devices, 1.6% of patients developed symptomatic VT, and CRBSI occurred in 1.6% of patients. There were no cases of phlebitis or extravasation and only three cases of vein laceration or vein perforation. The catheters showed high success rates in completing therapy (81.8%), maintaining patency (93.9%) and achieving successful placement in a single attempt (90.4%). Clinicians overwhelmingly agreed that both the guidewire and stylet (93.3% and 94.4%, respectively) were easy or very easy to use. This study demonstrates the safety and performance of PowerPICC catheters across diverse settings and patient cohorts in real-world hospital settings across Europe. The findings indicate that these catheters are safe and can be effectively used in the general patient setting and when inserted by a variety of clinicians.

39348196,Leveraging Personal Technologies in the Treatment of Schizophrenia Spectrum Disorders: Scoping Review.,2024-09-30,JMIR mental health,10.2196/57150,"Digital mental health is a rapidly growing field with an increasing evidence base due to its potential scalability and impacts on access to mental health care. Further, within underfunded service systems, leveraging personal technologies to deliver or support specialized service delivery has garnered attention as a feasible and cost-effective means of improving access. Digital health relevance has also improved as technology ownership in individuals with schizophrenia has improved and is comparable to that of the general population. However, less digital health research has been conducted in groups with schizophrenia spectrum disorders compared to other mental health conditions, and overall feasibility, efficacy, and clinical integration remain largely unknown. This review aims to describe the available literature investigating the use of personal technologies (ie, phone, computer, tablet, and wearables) to deliver or support specialized care for schizophrenia and examine opportunities and barriers to integrating this technology into care. Given the size of this review, we used scoping review methods. We searched 3 major databases with search teams related to schizophrenia spectrum disorders, various personal technologies, and intervention outcomes related to recovery. We included studies from the full spectrum of methodologies, from development papers to implementation trials. Methods and reporting follow the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines. This search resulted in 999 studies, which, through review by at least 2 reviewers, included 92 publications. Included studies were published from 2010 to 2023. Most studies examined multitechnology interventions (40/92, 43%) or smartphone apps (25/92, 27%), followed by SMS text messaging (16/92, 17%) and internet-based interventions (11/92, 12%). No studies used wearable technology on its own to deliver an intervention. Regarding the stage of research in the field, the largest number of publications were pilot studies (32/92, 35%), followed by randomized control trials (RCTs; 20/92, 22%), secondary analyses (16/92, 17%), RCT protocols (16/92, 17%), development papers (5/92, 5%), and nonrandomized or quasi-experimental trials (3/92, 3%). Most studies did not report on safety indices (55/92, 60%) or privacy precautions (64/92, 70%). Included studies tend to report consistent positive user feedback regarding the usability, acceptability, and satisfaction with technology; however, engagement metrics are highly variable and report mixed outcomes. Furthermore, efficacy at both the pilot and RCT levels report mixed findings on primary outcomes. Overall, the findings of this review highlight the discrepancy between the high levels of acceptability and usability of these digital interventions, mixed efficacy results, and difficulties with sustained engagement. The discussion highlights common patterns that may underscore this observation in the field; however, as this was a scoping review, a more in-depth systematic review or meta-analysis may be required to better understand the trends outlined in this review.",D'Arcey J; Asuncion TR; Tackaberry-Giddens L; Zahid A; Ishak M; Foussias G; Kidd S,Schizophrenia Division,

To enable that medical services are available to all that need it, innovative solutions are needed. One of those, a Short Message Service (SMS)-supported basal insulin titration service is investigated in this study. The primary objective was to determine the percentage of subjects who achieved stable fasting blood glucose (FBG) within their individual target range with this service after week 16. This single-arm, 16-week study aimed to enroll 111 adults diagnosed with type 2 diabetes that needed insulin. The study subjects measured their FBG 4 consecutive days to establish a baseline, then received SMS prompts for daily FBG measurements and evening insulin injections until their FBG stabilized within the target range. Adjusting the insulin based on the FBG. Once stabilization was achieved, subjects continued with their optimal insulin dose for the remainder of the study. Sixteen weeks after the baseline, subjects measured FBG for 4 days before visit 4, where these values were read by the healthcare provider. Out of the planned 111 subjects, only 30 were enrolled, with one withdrawal prior to service activation. Challenges in subject recruitment were attributed to the COVID-19 outbreak, limited eligibility, competing studies, and new medications delaying insulin initiation. Subjects were on average 59.97 years old, had an HbA1c of 9.29% a FBG of 205.64 mg/dl, and had diabetes for 10 years. Among the 29 subjects who started the service, 72% achieved successful titration at visit 4, with a median time of 49 days. Notable improvements were observed in HbA1c levels (decreased by 1.58%) and FBG levels (decreased by 64 mg/dl) over the 16-week study period. No adverse events or device-related issues were reported. Despite recruitment challenges, guided basal insulin titration holds promise for insulin therapy initiation in individuals.

A major barrier for applying automated wearable electroencephalography sleep staging in clinical populations is the need for large-scale data for model training. We therefore investigated transfer learning as a strategy to overcome limited data availability and optimize automated single-channel electroencephalography sleep staging in people with sleep disorders. We acquired 52 single-channel frontopolar headband electroencephalography recordings from a heterogeneous sleep-disordered population with concurrent polysomnography (PSG). We compared 3 model training strategies: ""pretraining"" (ie, training on a larger dataset of 901 conventional PSGs), ""training-from-scratch"" (ie, training on wearable headband recordings), and ""fine-tuning"" (ie, training on conventional PSGs, followed by training on headband recordings). Performance was evaluated on all headband recordings using 10-fold cross-validation. Highest performance for 5-stage classification was achieved with fine-tuning (κ = .778), significantly higher than with pretraining (κ = .769) and with training-from-scratch (κ = .733). No significant differences or systematic biases were observed with clinically relevant sleep parameters derived from PSG. All sleep disorder categories showed comparable performance. This study emphasizes the importance of leveraging larger available datasets through deep transfer learning to optimize performance with limited data availability. Findings indicate strong similarity in data characteristics between conventional PSG and headband recordings. Altogether, results suggest the combination of the headband, classification model, and training methodology can be viable for sleep monitoring in the heterogeneous clinical population. van der Aar JF, van Gilst MM, van den Ende DA, et al.

A retrospective study was conducted of 14 cats with ureteral and/or urethral obstructions secondary to diagnosed or suspected transitional cell carcinoma (TCC). In all cats, a SUB device and/or a SEMS was placed to relieve the obstruction(s). Group 1 consisted of cats with ureteral obstructions, with or without concurrent urethral obstructions, and group 2 consisted of cats with only urethral obstructions. Eight cats were included in group 1 (seven with concurrent urethral obstructions) and six cats were included in group 2. TCC was confirmed in 8/14 cats. Repeat urethral obstruction due to tumor in growth occurred in 6/13 (46%) cats with a SEMS, and no cats developed recurrent ureteral obstructions after placement of the SUB device. Three cats had additional covered stents placed after urethral re-obstruction. The median survival time (MST) from the time of device placement was 52 days in group 1 (mean 92; range 14-349) and 80 days in group 2 (mean 96; range 7-209). The MST from the time of mass identification of the cats that did and did not receive adjunctive therapy was 349 days (mean 358; range 124-602) and 43 days (mean 113; range 14-423), respectively. The use of bypass devices for feline malignant urinary outflow tract obstructions is a viable option to provide immediate renal and urinary bladder decompression. TCC in cats is locally aggressive and can result in urethral re-obstruction, prompting consideration for placing a covered urethral stent. The use of adjunctive therapies for malignant neoplasia should be considered to improve overall survival once the obstruction has been relieved.",,,

As yet, a comparison between both devices has not been performed. The Mannheim Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy Registry (MARACANA) and the Mannheim Cardiac Contractility Modulation Observational Study (MAINTAINED) included all patients who received CRTs or CCMs in our medical centre between 2012 and 2021. For the present analysis, we retrospectively compared patients provided with either CRT-Ds (n = 220) or CCMs with additional defibrillators (n = 105) regarding New York Heart Association classification (NYHA), LVEF, tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE), QRS-width and other HF modification aspects after 12 months. Before implantation, CCM patients presented with lower LVEF (23.6 ± 6.2 vs. 26.3 ± 6.5%) and worse NYHA (3.03 ± 0.47 vs. 2.81 ± 0.48, both P < 0.05), compared with CRT-D patients. Follow-up improvements in NYHA (2.43 ± 0.67 vs. 2.28 ± 0.72), LVEF (30.5 ± 10.7 vs. 35.2 ± 10.5%) and TAPSE (17.2 ± 5.2 vs. 17.1 ± 4.8 to 18.9 ± 3.4 vs. 17.3 ± 3.6 mm, each P < 0.05) were comparable.

In this study, biocompatible printable inks based on chitosan, collagen and gelatin were developed and 3D-printed with a pneumatic-based extrusion printer. The printability of various chitosan-gelatin (CS-Gel) hydrogel inks was assessed by evaluating the quality of the printed constructs. The inks required an extrusion pressure of 150 ± 40 MPa with G22 and G25 nozzles for optimal printing. Inks with low chitosan concentrations (<4% w/v) exhibited poor printability, while inks with 4 % w/v chitosan and 1 % w/v gelatin (CG) demonstrated satisfactory extrusion and printing quality. The addition of collagen (0.1 % w/v) to the optimized ink (CGC) did not compromise printability. Post-printing stabilization using KOH produced self-supporting scaffolds with consistent morphological integrity, while weaker bases like NaOH/EtOH and ammonia vapors resulted in lower pore sizes and reduced structural stability. Water evaporation studies showed that neutralized samples had slower evaporation rates due to the strong intermolecular interactions formed during the neutralization process, contributing to a stable crosslinked network. FTIR spectra confirmed the formation of polyelectrolyte complexes in the CS-Gel and CS-Gel-Collagen blends, further enhancing structural stability. Swelling tests indicated that neutralized constructs maintained stability in different pH environments, with KOH-treated samples exhibiting the lowest swelling ratios and the highest structural stability. After optimizing the ink composition, 10 wt% Levofloxacin was loaded in the constructs as a model antibiotic and it's in vitro release rate was quantified. Drug loading was approximately 4 % for both ink compositions GC and CGC. CG Levo released over 80 % of levofloxacin within the first hour, reaching full release in 24 h, indicating inadequate control, while CGK Levo exhibited slower initial release (55 % in 15 min) followed by stabilized release after 4 h, likely due to controlled diffusion from expanded constructs. These findings demonstrate that the developed hydrogel inks and optimized printing parameters can produce scaffolds suitable for tissue engineering applications. Finally, the cell compatibility of the 3D-printed constructs was confirmed with MTT assay on fibroblasts and the antimicrobial activity of the drug-loaded constructs was tested against E. coli and S. aureus, showing an increase of the bacteria free zone from 8 ± 0.4 mm of the control against E. coli up to 16.4 ± 0.37 mm in the presence of the KOH-treated CG Levo printed construct.",Michopoulou A,Biohellenika Biotechnology Company,dbic@chem.auth.gr.

39338640,Remotely Powered Two-Wire Cooperative Sensors for Bioimpedance Imaging Wearables.,2024-09-28,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",10.3390/s24185896,"Bioimpedance imaging aims to generate a 3D map of the resistivity and permittivity of biological tissue from multiple impedance channels measured with electrodes applied to the skin. When the electrodes are distributed around the body (for example, by delineating a cross section of the chest or a limb), bioimpedance imaging is called electrical impedance tomography (EIT) and results in functional 2D images. Conventional EIT systems rely on individually cabling each electrode to master electronics in a star configuration. This approach works well for rack-mounted equipment; however, the bulkiness of the cabling is unsuitable for a wearable system. Previously presented cooperative sensors solve this cabling problem using active (dry) electrodes connected via a two-wire parallel bus. The bus can be implemented with two unshielded wires or even two conductive textile layers, thus replacing the cumbersome wiring of the conventional star arrangement. Prior research demonstrated cooperative sensors for measuring bioimpedances, successfully realizing a measurement reference signal, sensor synchronization, and data transfer though still relying on individual batteries to power the sensors. Subsequent research using cooperative sensors for biopotential measurements proposed a method to remove batteries from the sensors and have the central unit supply power over the two-wire bus. Building from our previous research, this paper presents the application of this method to the measurement of bioimpedances. Two different approaches are discussed, one using discrete, commercially available components, and the other with an application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC). The initial experimental results reveal that both approaches are feasible, but the ASIC approach offers advantages for medical safety, as well as lower power consumption and a smaller size.",,,

Melt-extruded multi-bored microfluidic capillaries allow for high-throughput testing with low device cost, but simple devices may limit control over sample flow when compared to the more complex ""lab-on-a-chip"" devices produced using advanced microfluidic fabrication methods. Previously, we measured the dynamics of global haemostasis stimulated by thrombin by dipping straight vertical microcapillaries into blood, but only the most rapid response could be monitored, as flow slowed significantly within 30 s. Here, we show an innovative method to extend both the stimulation process and flow measurement time without increasing the cost of the device by adding simple loops to the flexible extruded device. The loops enable longer time-scale measurements by increasing resistance to flow, thereby reducing the dependence on high stimulus concentrations for rapid reactions. The instantaneous velocity and equilibrium heights of straight and looped vertical microcapillary films were assessed with water, plasma and whole blood, showing that the loops create additional frictional resistances, reduce flow velocity and prolong residence times for increased time scales of the stimulation process. A modified pressure balance model was used to capture flow dynamics with the added loop. Looped devices loaded with thrombin and collagen showed an improved detection of blood stimulation responses even with lower stimulus concentrations, compared to straight vertical capillaries. Thrombin-activated blood samples in straight capillaries provided a maximum measurement zone of only 4 mm, while the looped design significantly increased this to 11 mm for much longer time scale measurements. Our results suggest that extending stimulation times can be achieved without complex microfluidic fabrication methods, potentially improving concentration-response blood stimulation assays, and may enhance the accuracy and reliability. We conclude adding a loop to low-cost extruded microfluidic devices may bring microfluidic devices closer to delivering on their promise of widespread, decentralized low-cost evaluation of blood response to stimulation in both research and clinical settings.",,,

Importantly, most current systems lack the provision of somatosensory information that is congruent with the virtual training task. This paper introduces a novel haptic robotic system designed for upper-limb rehabilitation, focusing on enhancing sensorimotor rehabilitation through comprehensive haptic rendering. We developed a novel haptic rehabilitation device with a unique combination of degrees of freedom that allows the virtual training of functional reach and grasp tasks, where we use a physics engine-based haptic rendering method to render whole-hand interactions between the patients' hands and virtual tangible objects. To evaluate the feasibility of our system, we performed a clinical mixed-method usability study with seven patients and seven therapists working in neurorehabilitation. We employed standardized questionnaires to gather quantitative data and performed semi-structured interviews with all participants to gain qualitative insights into the perceived usability and usefulness of our technological solution. The device demonstrated ease of use and adaptability to various hand sizes without extensive setup. Therapists and patients reported high satisfaction levels, with the system facilitating engaging and meaningful rehabilitation exercises. Participants provided notably positive feedback, particularly emphasizing the system's available degrees of freedom and its haptic rendering capabilities. Therapists expressed confidence in the transferability of sensorimotor skills learned with our system to activities of daily living, although further investigation is needed to confirm this. The novel haptic robotic system effectively supports upper-limb rehabilitation post-stroke, offering high-fidelity haptic feedback and engaging training tasks. Its clinical usability, combined with positive feedback from both therapists and patients, underscores its potential to enhance robotic neurorehabilitation.",Conti F,Force Dimension,raphael.raetz@unibe.ch.

The majority of these studies, however, have used monodispersed polystyrene microspheres (PSMs) as 'model' particles. Here we review the differences between the manufacture and resulting physicochemical properties of polystyrene used in commerce and the PSMs most commonly used in toxicity studies. In general, we demonstrate that significant complexity exists as to the properties of polystyrene particles. Differences in chemical composition, size, shape, surface functionalities and other aspects raise doubt as to whether PSMs are fit-for-purpose for the study of potential adverse effects of naturally occurring NMPs. A realistic assessment of potential health implications of the exposure to environmental NMPs requires better characterisation of the particles, a robust mechanistic understanding of their interactions and effects in biological systems as well as standardised protocols to generate relevant model particles. It is proposed that multidisciplinary engagement is necessary for the development of a timely and effective strategy towards this end. We suggest a holistic framework, which must be supported by a multidisciplinary group of experts to work towards either providing access to a suite of environmentally relevant NMPs and/or developing guidance with respect to best practices that can be adopted by research groups to generate and reliably use NMPs. It is emphasized that there is a need for this group to agree to a consensus regarding what might best represent a model NMP that is consistent with environmental exposure for human health, and which can be used to support a variety of ongoing research needs, including those associated with exposure and hazard assessment, mechanistic toxicity studies, toxicokinetics and guidance regarding the prioritization of plastic and NMPs that likely represent the greatest risk to human health. It is important to acknowledge, however, that establishing a multidisciplinary group, or an expert community of practice, represents a non-trivial recommendation, and will require significant resources in terms of expertise and funding. There is currently an opportunity to bring together a multidisciplinary group of experts, including polymer chemists, material scientists, mechanical engineers, exposure and life-cycle assessment scientists, toxicologists, microbiologists and analytical chemists, to provide leadership and guidance regarding a consensus on defining what best represents environmentally relevant NMPs. We suggest that given the various complex issues surrounding the environmental and human health implications that exposure to NMPs represents, that a multidisciplinary group of experts are thus critical towards helping to progress the harmonization and standardization of methods.",Gouin T; Ellis-Hutchings R; Pemberton M; Wilhelmus B,INEOS Styrolution Group GmbH; Systox Limited; The Dow Chemical Company; TG Environmental Research,todd.gouin@environresearch.com.

However, data from prospective randomized trials is lacking. This analysis compares the outcomes of patients with and without DM enrolled in the Best Endovascular vs Best Surgical Therapy in patients with Chronic Limb-Threatening Ischemia (BEST-CLI) trial. Baseline characteristics were compared between patients with and without DM in the BEST-CLI trial. Cox regression was used to determine the association between DM and major outcomes of major adverse limb events (MALE), reintervention, above-ankle amputation, and all-cause death. Among 1777 patients who underwent LER, 69.2% had DM. Compared with patients without DM, those with DM were significantly younger, less likely to be White, and more likely to be Hispanic. Patients with DM were more likely to have hypertension, hyperlipidemia, coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, and renal disease and be on optimal medical therapy (antiplatelets and statins), whereas patients without DM were significantly more likely to be smokers and have chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Patients with DM were significantly more likely to present with late Wound Ischemia foot Infection (WIfI) stages (3-4) (73.7% vs 45.9%; P < .001) that were driven predominantly by differences in wound and infection grade. Conversely, patients without DM had significantly lower ankle pressures and toe pressures and were significantly more likely to have WIfI ischemia grade 3 compared with patients with DM (60% vs 52.5%; P = .016). At 3 years, patients with DM exhibited higher rates of above-ankle amputation and all-cause death compared with patients without DM. Kaplan-Meier analysis demonstrated significantly higher MALE or all-cause death compared with patients without DM (3-year estimate: 53.5% vs 46.4%; P < .001). After adjusting for potential confounders, regression analysis demonstrated that DM was independently associated with increased above-ankle amputation (1.75 [1.22-2.51]), all-cause death (1.63 [1.31-2.03]), and MALE or all-cause death (1.24 [1.04-1.47]). Patients with DM undergoing LER for chronic limb-threatening ischemia experienced a greater incidence of MALE or all-cause death compared with patients without DM. The impact of DM seems to be mediated by more severe wounds and infections at the time of presentation, and a higher prevalence of cardiac and renal disease.",,,cassius.chaar@yale.edu.

The virtual source model, as one of the beam modelling methods, offers the advantage of not requiring detailed accelerator information. Although various virtual source models exist, manual adjustment to these models demands a substantial investment of time and computational resources. There has long been a desire to develop an efficient and automated approach for model commissioning. To develop an automatic commissioning method for the virtual source model to customize the accelerator model for independent Monte Carlo dose verification. Initially, the accelerator model is established using the virtual source model and self-developed Jaw and MLC models. Then, a fully automated iteration process is employed to adjust the parameters of the virtual source model. Three types of objective functions are designed to represent differences from water tank measurements. Each objective function is paired with a specific parameter for adjustment, and their effectiveness is demonstrated through physical evidence. In each iteration, parameters with the highest objective function percentage are chosen for adjustment, and step length is determined based on current objective function values. Iteration is terminated when changes in any direction from the optimal solution no longer produce an improvement. Dose verification model for nine accelerators has been accomplished using this method. Additionally, under the same initial conditions, verification models for Versa HD accelerator (FF and FFF modes) are established using this method, Nelder-Mead Simplex optimization method, and the Bayesian optimization method to compare the efficiency and quality of these three iterative approaches. Iterations for all nine accelerators are completed within 30 iterations. The relative dose differences in dose fall-off region compared to water tank measurements are all less than 2%, and the average gamma passing rates (3%/2 mm) for ArcCHECK measurements in QA plans are all higher than 97%. For Versa HD accelerator in FFF and FF modes, the proposed method achieves an average relative dose difference below 1% within 11 and 13 iterations, respectively. In contrast, the Simplex optimization reached 1% within 78 iterations in FFF mode. Furthermore, the Simplex optimization in FF mode and Bayesian optimization in both modes failed to achieve a 1% difference within 100 iterations. The proposed iterative method achieves fast and automated commissioning of dose verification models, contributing to accurate and reliable clinical dose verification.",Ren Q,Anhui Wisdom Technology Company Limited,

With severe pelvic obliquity, the ribs come into contact with the high side of the oblique pelvis, termed rib-on-pelvis deformity (ROP). ROP can result in costo-iliac impingement, or pain associated with ROP, and can also adversely affect breathing and sitting balance. The goal of this study was to evaluate whether CP patients with ROP have worse health-related quality of life (HRQOL) before surgery and a greater improvement in HRQOL after surgery. A retrospective analysis of a prospectively collected, multicenter, international registry was performed for all nonambulatory patients with CP treated with spinal fusion with at least two-year follow-up. HRQOL was measured via the Caregiver Priorities & Child Health Index of Life with Disabilities (CPCHILD) questionnaire domains (0 = most disability, 100 = least disability). ROP was defined as having a rib distal to the superior portion of the iliac crest on preop upright radiographs. The ROP group and control group without ROP were compared regarding six domain scores and total score of CPCHILD. Multiple linear regression was used to control for curve apex location, major coronal Cobb angle, type of tone, and pelvic obliquity. 340 patients met inclusion criteria (52% female, mean age 14.0 years). The mean major coronal Cobb angle was 81 degrees and mean pelvic obliquity was 22 degrees. 176 patients (51.8%) had ROP while 164 patients (48.2%) did not.

Particular focus must be placed on the often underexplored aspect of trial termination for INDs. To systematically review the ethical challenges encountered in clinical trials for INDs at the juncture of trial termination. We conducted a rapid review using PubMed with two specific search queries, including all publications addressing ethical issues in the context of IND clinical trials. Priority was given to publications focusing on the end of treatment or the discontinuation of clinical studies or trials. We identified three primary groups of ethical challenges: patient-centric challenges, challenges faced by the research and physician team, and manufacturer-related issues. Further analysis highlights the importance of initiating early, transparent discussions regarding trial cessation protocols, ensuring that all stakeholders-patients, healthcare providers, researchers, and manufacturers-are equitably considered. Additionally, we found a discrepancy between current discontinuation strategies and international ethical guidelines. To address this, we emphasize the ethical obligation to establish comprehensive exit strategies that align with the principles in the Declaration of Helsinki and the CIOMS/WHO guidelines. Our findings highlight the need for increased attention to the ethical and practical aspects of exit strategies and encourage further empirical research to address gaps in current practices.

Standard care patients (n = 338) received standardized tiered fever treatment on occurrence of temperature of 38 °C or greater. Primary outcome was daily mean fever burden: the area under the temperature curve above 37.9 °C (total fever burden) divided by the total number of hours in the acute phase, multiplied by 24 hours (°C-hour). The principal secondary outcome was 3-month functional recovery by shift analysis of the 6-category modified Rankin Scale, which is scored from 0 (no symptoms) to 6 (death). Major adverse events included death, pneumonia, sepsis, and malignant cerebral edema.

39319811,Use of Long Spinal Board Post-Application of Protocol for Spinal Motion Restriction for Spinal Cord Injury.,2024-09-25,The western journal of emergency medicine,10.5811/westjem.18342,"Historically, prehospital care of trauma patients has included nearly universal use of a cervical collar (C-collar) and long spine board (LSB). Due to recent evidence demonstrating harm in using LSBs, implementation of new spinal motion restriction (SMR) protocols in the prehospital setting should reduce LSB use, even among patients with spinal cord injury. Our goal in this study was to evaluate the rates of and reasons for LSB use in high-risk patients-those with hospital-diagnosed spinal cord injury (SCI)-after statewide implementation of SMR protocols. Applying data from a state emergency medical services (EMS) registry to a state hospital discharge database, we identified cases in which a participating EMS agency provided care for a patient later diagnosed in the hospital with a SCI. Cases were then retrospectively reviewed to determine the prevalence of both LSB and C-collar use before and after agency adoption of a SMR protocol. We reviewed cases with LSB use after SMR protocol implementation to determine the motivations driving continued LSB use. We used simple descriptive statistics, odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) to describe the results. We identified 52 EMS agencies in the state of Arizona with 417,979 encounters. There were 225 patients with SCI, of whom 74 were excluded. The LSBs were used in 52 pre-SMR (81%) and 49 post-SMR (56%) cases. The odds of LSB use after SMR protocol implementation was 70% lower than it had been before implementation (OR 0.297, 95% CI 0.139-0.643;  Implementation of selective spinal motion restriction protocols was associated with a statistically significant decrease in the utilization of long spine boards among prehospital patients with acute traumatic spinal cord injury.",Chikani V,ADHS Bureau of EMS and Trauma,

Wearable devices provide objective data on many rich physical activity dimensions including steps, duration, distance, and intensity. Little is known about how patients with IBDs engage in these varying dimensions of exercise and how it may influence their symptom and disease-specific patient-reported outcomes (PROs). This study aims to (1) cluster physical activity patterns from consumer-grade wearable devices and (2) assess the relationship between the clusters and PROs in patients with IBDs. We conducted a cross-sectional and longitudinal cohort study among adults with IBDs in the Crohn's and Colitis Foundation IBD Partners cohort. Participants contribute physical activity data through smartphone apps or wearable devices in a bring-your-own-device model. Participants also complete biannual PRO questionnaires from the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System short forms and IBD-specific questionnaires. K-means cluster analysis was used to generate physical activity clusters based on 3 key features: number of steps, duration of moderate to vigorous activity (minutes), and distance of activity (miles). Based on the clusters, we conducted a cross-sectional analysis to examine differences in mean questionnaire scores and participant characteristics using one-way ANOVA and chi-square tests. We also conducted a longitudinal analysis to examine individual cluster transitions among participants who completed multiple questionnaires, and mean differences in questionnaire scores were compared using 2-tailed paired sample t tests across 6-month periods. Among 430 participants comprising 1255 six-week physical activity periods, we identified clusters of low (33.7%, n=423), moderate (46%, n=577), and high (20.3%, n=255) physical activity. Scores varied across clusters for depression (P=.004), pain interference (P<.001), fatigue (P<.001), sleep disturbance (P<.001), social satisfaction (P<.001), and short Crohn Disease Activity Index (P<.001), with those in the low activity cluster having the worst scores. Sociodemographic characteristics also differed, and those with low physical activity were older (P=.002), had higher BMIs (P<.001), and had longer disease durations (P=.02) compared to other clusters. Among 246 participants who completed at least 2 consecutive questionnaires consisting of 726 questionnaire periods, 67.8% (n=492) remained in the same cluster, and only 1.2% (n=9) moved to or from the furthest clusters of low and high activity across 6-month periods. For patients with IBDs, there were positive associations between physical activity and PROs related to disease activity and psychosocial domains. Physical activity patterns mostly did not fluctuate over time, suggesting little variation in exercise levels in the absence of an intervention. The use of real-world data to identify subgroups with similar lifestyle behaviors could be leveraged to develop targeted interventions that provide support for psychosocial symptoms and physical activity for personalized IBD care.",Griffin AC,VA Palo Alto Health Care System,

Early identification of ketosis is a cornerstone in DKA prevention and management. Current methods for ketone measurement by people with diabetes include capillary blood or urine testing. These approaches have limitations, including the need to carry testing strips that have a limited shelf life and a requirement for the user to initiate a test. Recent studies have shown the feasibility of continuous ketone monitoring (CKM) via interstitial fluid with a sensor inserted subcutaneously employing an enzymatic electrochemical reaction. Ketone readings can be updated every 5 minutes. In the future, one would expect that commercialized devices will incorporate alarms linked with standardized thresholds and trend arrows. Ideally, to minimize the burden on users, CKM functionality should be integrated with other devices used to implement glucose management, including continuous glucose monitors and insulin pumps. We suggest CKM provision to all at risk of DKA and recommend that the devices should be worn continuously. Those who may particularly benefit are individuals who have T1D, are pregnant, on medications such as sodium-glucose linked transporter (SGLT) inhibitors that increase DKA, people with recurrent DKA, those with T1D undertaking high intensity exercise, are socially or geographically isolated, or those on low carbohydrate diets. The provision of ketone profiles will provide important clinical insights that have previously been unavailable to people living with diabetes and their healthcare professionals.",,,

Clinical results of these available drying methods are not satisfactory. The aim of this study was to compare the drying cycle of a standard endoscope washer-disinfector (EWD) (standard drying method [SD]) with a shortened mandatory drying by the EWD followed by a special drying device using laminar and turbulent air flow (novel drying method [ND]). Sixty endoscopes (duodenoscopes, colonoscocopes, and gastroscopes) from 3 different manufacturers underwent high-level disinfection and drying depending on the randomization group. Operational time of drying was measured for both groups. Residual fluid in the channels was measured using a laboratory scale. After a 14-day storage period, a sample of the endoscope channels was obtained to determine bacterial contamination. ND had significantly fewer residual water in endoscope channels (SD: 90% vs ND: 0%; P < 0.001) after high-level disinfection and drying and less bacterial contamination after storage for 14 days (SD: 47% vs ND: 20%; P = 0.028). Time consumed for drying in ND was also significantly shorter (SD: 16 minutes 4 seconds vs ND: 5 minutes 59 seconds; P < 0.001). Drying with a special automatic drying device was superior compared with an EWD's drying program as evidenced by no measurable residual water, reduced microbiological contamination, and a more than 2-fold decrease in operational time. Thus, drying by laminar and turbulent airflow may represent an attractive alternative to the currently used standard approach in the reprocessing process of flexible endoscopes.",,,

Ideally, this should be complemented by a careful consideration of the administration route. 6'siallyllactosamine-functionalized β-cyclodextrin (CD-6'SLN) is a novel entry inhibitor that acts as a mimic of the primary attachment receptor of influenza, sialic acid. In this study, we aimed to develop a dry powder formulation of CD-6'SLN to assess its in vivo antiviral activity after administration via the pulmonary route. By means of spray drying the compound together with trileucine, a dispersion enhancer, we created a powder that retained the antiviral effect of the drug, remained stable under elevated temperature conditions and performed well in a dry powder inhaler. To test the efficacy of the dry powder drug against influenza infection in vivo, infected mice were treated with CD-6'SLN using an aerosol generator that allowed for the controlled administration of powder formulations to the lungs of mice. CD-6'SLN was effective in mitigating the course of the disease compared to the control groups, reflected by lower disease activity scores and by the prevention of virus-induced IL-6 production.

However, implant motion can deter osteointegration and increase bone resorption, where micromotion less than 0.150 mm is crucial for bony ingrowth and vital to the success of the implant. The interaction between the implant and the metaphyseal bone and its effects on stability remains unclear. Therefore, this cadaveric study aims to assess the immediate stability of two stemless prostheses in low bone density specimens. Twenty cadaveric shoulders were used to compare the stability of two stemless shoulder implants by Zimmer-Biomet (model A) and Exactech (model B), subjected to loads of 220 N, 520 N, and 820 N to assess strain and micromotion. Micromotion at 220 N load was 0.061 ± 0.080 mm and 0.053 ± 0.050 mm, and at 520 N load, 0.279 ± 0.37 mm and 0.311 ± 0.35 mm for models A and B, respectively. The estimated mean force required to achieve a 150 μm micromotion was 356 ± 116 N and 315 ± 61 N for models A and B, respectively. Motion analysis revealed distinct movement patterns for each implant, with model B demonstrating better force distribution on the bone despite no significance. Forces over 520 N (high postoperative rehabilitation force) could hinder bone integration with prostheses due to excessive micromotion. Conversely, forces around 220 N (preconditioning loading force) are considered safe for prosthesis stability even with low bone density. These insights may caution against using stemless implants when bone density is low, and help guide clinical decisions on the duration of rehabilitation and sling use after stemless arthroplasty.",,,anazaria@bidmc.harvard.edu.

Problems with electrode contact and restriction on measurable signals often result in unstable and inaccurate scoring for clinical use. To address these issues, we propose a method based on ensemble of small sleep stage scoring models with different input signal sets. By excluding models that employ problematic signals from the voting process, our method can mitigate the effects of electrode contact failure. Comparative experiments demonstrated that our method could reduce the impact of contact problems and improve scoring accuracy for epochs with problematic signals by 8.3 points, while also decreasing the deterioration in scoring accuracy from 7.9 to 0.3 points compared to typical methods. Additionally, we confirmed that assigning different input sets to small models did not diminish the advantages of the ensemble but instead increased its efficacy. The proposed model can improve overall scoring accuracy and minimize the effect of problematic signals simultaneously, making in-home sleep stage scoring systems more suitable for clinical practice.",Kawana F,Yumino Heart Clinic,horie@cs.tsukuba.ac.jp.

39298860,Soft tissue elasticity in total knee arthroplasty: An in vivo quantitative analysis.,2024-11-23,"Clinical biomechanics (Bristol, Avon)",10.1016/j.clinbiomech.2024.106335,"Soft tissue balance is essential for total knee arthroplasty success. The elastic properties of soft tissues affect knee-joint stability and flexibility. This study proposed a novel methodology for in vivo quantitative analysis of soft tissue elasticity during total knee arthroplasty. In this study, we aimed to (1) establish a mathematical model to depict medial and lateral soft tissue elasticity, (2) report the individual differences and interindividual commonalities in soft tissue elasticity. A specifically designed knee tensor was used to evaluate soft tissue elasticity by dynamically applying sequential tensions to medial and lateral compartments while measuring knee joint gaps in both compartments. Measurements were performed on ten knees of six cadavers. Bivariate polynomial regression was used for analysis, and the equivalent elastic coefficient (N/mm) was calculated. Soft-tissue elasticity showed high individual differences. The equivalent elastic coefficient was larger in the medial compartment than in the lateral compartment, and the equivalent elastic coefficient of the lateral compartment gradually decreased while the medial equivalent elastic coefficient remained constant when the knee was flexed. The lateral gaps increased from 0.1 to 3.9 mm, and the medial gaps increased from 0 to 1.5 mm when the tension increased from 60 to 90 N. The shapes and distributions of the silkworm-like lattices in elasticity and balance evaluations are clinically relevant to knee balance. Soft-tissue balance in total knee arthroplasty is significantly affected by soft-tissue elasticity. An intraoperative quantitative analysis of elasticity helps to tail an individualized balancing target for total knee arthroplasty.",,,orthoyixin@yahoo.com.

Part B, Applied biomaterials",10.1002/jbm.b.35486,"Hydrogels have emerged as potential materials for bone grafting, thanks to their biocompatibility, biodegradation, and flexibility in filling irregular bone defects. In this study, we fabricated a novel NAH hydrogel system, composed of N,O-carboxymethyl chitosan (NOCC), aldehyde hyaluronic acid (AHA), and hydroxyapatite (HAp). To improve the mechanical strength of the fabricated hydrogel, a porous polycaprolactone (PCL) matrix was synthesized and used as a three-dimensional (3D) support template for NAH hydrogel loading, forming a novel PCL/NAH hybrid scaffold. A mixture of monosodium glutamate (M) and sucrose (S) at varied weight ratios (5M:5S, 7M:3S, and 9M:1S) was used for the fabrication of 3D PCL matrices. The morphology, interconnectivity, and water resistance of the porous PCL scaffolds were investigated for optimal hydrogel loading efficiency. The results demonstrated that PCL scaffolds with porogen ratios of 7M:3S and 9M:1S possessed better interconnectivity than 5M:5S ratio. The compressive strength of the PCL/NAH hybrid scaffolds with 9M:1S (561.6 ± 6.1 kPa) and 7M:3S (623.8 ± 6.8 kPa) ratios are similar to cancellous bone and all hybrid scaffolds were biocompatible. Rabbit models with tibial defects were implanted with the PCL/NAH scaffolds to assess the wound healing capability. The results suggest that the PCL/NAH hybrid scaffolds, specifically those with porogen ratio of 7M:3S, exhibit promising bone healing effects.",Le HT,Medi Mech Research and Development Company,

This has boosted an incessant search for novel carriers and methodologies to drive these compounds throughout the BBB. However, it remains a challenge to artificially mimic the physiology and function of the human BBB, allowing a reliable, reproducible and throughput screening of these rapidly growing technologies and nanoformulations (NFs). To surpass these challenges, brain-on-a-chip (BoC) - advanced microphysiological platforms that emulate key features of the brain composition and functionality, with the potential to emulate pathophysiological signatures of neurological disorders, are emerging as a microfluidic tool to screen new brain-targeting drugs, investigate neuropathogenesis and reach personalized medicine. In this review, the advance of BoC as a bioengineered screening tool of new brain-targeting drugs and NFs, enabling to decipher the intricate nanotechnology-biology interface is discussed. Firstly, the main challenges to model the brain are outlined, then, examples of BoC platforms to recapitulate the neurodegenerative diseases and screen NFs are summarized, emphasizing the current most promising nanotechnological-based drug delivery strategies and lastly, the integration of high-throughput screening biosensing systems as possible cutting-edge technologies for an end-use perspective is discussed as future perspective.",,,sshin4@bhw.harvard.edu.
