40389795,Efficiency of Lifecycle Management for Medicinal Products in the EU: Industry Experience with Variations to Implement a New European Pharmacopoeia Active Substance Monograph for a Generic Eye Drops Solution - A Case Study.,,Therapeutic innovation & regulatory science,10.1007/s43441-025-00802-1,"While numerous efforts were taken by the regulators globally to have more streamlined and predictable post-approval CMC variation procedures, there are still areas where cumbersome and parallel assessments of variations may delay implementation of important CMC changes and bind resources in industry and regulatory authorities. In this case study a switch from an ASMF (Active Substance Master File) to the CEP (Certification of Suitability to the monographs of the European Pharmacopoeia) for an already approved manufacturer used for a generic ophthalmic formulation with 38 licenses (Marketing Authorisations, MAs) in the EEA was selected to investigate time needed for generation, submission and approval of variations as well as consistency of variation classification by experienced regulatory professionals and Competent Authorities (CAs), respectively. Overall, four variations were needed for the change from an ASMF to the CEP to cover the concomitant changes that were required to fully align with the European Pharmacopoeia (Ph. Eur.) requirements for the active substance and consequentially for drug product. In one case the CA requested a 5th variation to cover the switch from in-house to Ph. Eur. While average CAs approval time was 4.6 (± 2.1) months (range 2-8 months), overall it took 15.2 (± 2.8) months (range 11-20 months) from data collection and variation generation by the CDMO (Contract Development and Manufacturing Organization) until approval by the respective CA. Good alignment was achieved for most of the aspects, however, when implementation of Ph. Eur. requirements included removal or widening of acceptance criteria, there were quite diverse opinions on the classification by regulatory professionals and CAs, resulting in the same change to be approved as Type IA, Type IB, and Type II variations, respectively, in the different EEA countries. The long lead times and inconsistent variation classifications hamper switching to a new CEP or adding a new active substance supplier. More efficiency in variation regulations would be beneficial to allow for faster implementation of changes to assure the supply chain.",Schwarb FP; Lämmel B; Harder Engelhard BA,Siegfried AG,fpschwarb@gmail.com.

Current LC-MS/MS multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) methods could only detect selected Gly-Xaa-Yaa tripeptides in collagen hydrolysates owing to the limit of MRM channels. Here, an approach for simultaneous screening and semi-quantifying Gly-Pro-Yaa and Gly-Hyp-Yaa tripeptides was developed based on LC-MS/MS precursor ion scan, which provides broader analyte coverage compared to MRM's target-restricted detection. The diagnostic fragment ions at m/z 127 and 143, as well as the precursor m/z ranges of 230-336 and 246-252, were effective for detecting Gly-Pro-Yaa and Gly-Hyp-Yaa tripeptides, respectively, and there were 8 Gly-Pro-Yaa tripeptides and 12 Gly-Hyp-Yaa tripeptides screened out from 25 commercial collagen tripeptide products. By calculating the relative response factors (0.59-1.7) of six candidates, Gly-Pro-Hyp and Gly-Hyp-Ala were chosen as the preferred calibration standards for semi-quantification of individual/total Gly-Pro-Yaa and Gly-Hyp-Yaa tripeptides, respectively, with sensitivity, linearity and reproducibility validated. Gly-Pro-Hyp, Gly-Pro-Ala, Gly-Pro-Arg, Gly-Hyp-Arg, Gly-Hyp-Ala, and Gly-Hyp-Lys were abundantly found with over 70 % of the commercial products containing 1 %-9 % of any one of them.

40388610,Framework to identify innovative sources of value creation from platform technologies.,2025-05-19,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,10.1073/pnas.2424665122,"Platform technologies are fundamentally reshaping the pharmaceutical industry, offering unprecedented potential for innovation across multiple therapeutic areas. However, traditional valuation models, focused on single-asset metrics, struggle to capture the full spectrum of value these technologies create. This paper presents a comprehensive framework for evaluating the innovative sources of value creation enabled by platform technologies throughout the drug development lifecycle. Through a systematic literature review, in-depth case studies, and framework development, we provide a structured methodology for capturing the diverse benefits of these technologies. Our findings reveal that platform technologies generate value across strategic, technical, and adaptive dimensions, requiring a multifaceted valuation approach. The proposed Platform Value Identification across Strategic, Technical, and Adaptive domains Framework defines key value drivers, specifies quantitative assessment metrics, and provides implementation guidance to inform strategic decision-making in research and development investment, portfolio management, and business development. Application of the framework to case studies of Alnylam's RNAi platform, Genentech's therapeutic antibody platform, and Moderna's mRNA platform demonstrates its broad utility and impact potential. By adopting this holistic, data-driven approach, stakeholders can better assess the long-term value and competitive advantages of well-implemented platform technologies, accelerating the development of transformative therapies for patients.",Jones CH; Beitelshees M; Hill A; Griffiths D; Murphy M; Kapadia K; Dolsten M; True JM,Bulmore Consulting; Clearview Healthcare Partners; Pfizer,

40388415,R&D investment and total factor productivity in China's pharmaceutical industry: The moderating effect of the centralized procurement policy.,2025-05-19,PloS one,10.1371/journal.pone.0324519,"We use the implementation of China's centralized procurement policy as a quasi-natural experiment to examine the effects of China's centralized procurement policy on pharmaceutical research and development (R&D) investment and total factor productivity (TFP). Empirical findings demonstrate that the positive impact of R&D investment on TFP has a delayed effect in the pharmaceutical sector. The centralized procurement policy shortens this lagged effect by imposing survival pressure and pushing companies to enhance their R&D investment intensity significantly. From the heterogeneity perspective, for companies facing significant financing constraints, the centralized procurement policy significantly enhances the intensity of R&D investment. In contrast, for companies with weaker finance limitations, the impact of the policy on their R&D investment intensity is insignificant. Still, the positive moderating effect of the policy on the relationship between R&D investment and TFP is more pronounced. Based on the findings, policymakers need to take a long-term view and consider the diversified influence of different enterprises. Policies that reduce financing constraints and create an enabling environment for sustained R&D are important and complementary.",,,
40388390,Biofilms and antibiotic resistance profile of Enterococcus faecalis in selected dairy cattle farm environments in Bangladesh.,2025-05-19,PloS one,10.1371/journal.pone.0323667,"Enterococci are opportunistic zoonotic pathogens. Dairy cattle and farm environments are considered important sources of Enterococcus spp. Here, we detected biofilm-forming Enterococcus faecalis circulating in dairy cattle and farm environments, followed by the detection of their virulence genes, antibiogram phenotype analysis, and genotype characterization. Isolates were cultured and identified by PCR. Ability to biofilm formation was assessed using the Congo red agar test., followed by a disk diffusion test for antibiogram and PCR for virulence and resistance genes detection. Among 150 samples collected from 12 farms, 145 were culture-positive for Enterococci. Among these, 74 were PCR screened, of which 54.05% (40/74, CI 95%: 42.78-64.93) were E. faecalis. About 50% of E. faecalis isolates were strong biofilm formers, 37.5% were intermediate, and 12.5% were weak biofilm formers. In the antibiogram study, 87.5% of isolates were resistant to rifampicin, 75% to erythromycin, 67.5% to vancomycin, and 62.5% to ampicillin. Of the positive isolations of E. faecalis, 80% were positive for the vanA gene, and 50% were positive for the blaTEM resistance gene. Surprisingly, about 70% (28/40) of isolates showed a multidrug resistance phenotype. The Highest levels of multidrug-resistant E. faecalis were present in manure (87.5%) and isolates from Ullapara, Sirajganj.

The dough fermentability, the content of free sulfhydryl groups and wet gluten, specific volume, sensory evaluation were determined to evaluate the influence of Fuzhuan brick tea on wheat bread quality. When the ratio of tea to water was 6:100, the dough fermented faster, and the resulting bread, with the flavor of Fuzhuan brick tea, was of higher quality and more acceptable to consumers. Further activity studies showed that the water extract of Fuzhuan brick tea (WFT) had a good inhibitory effect on α-amylase and amyloglucosidase, which could slow down the digestion of bread in the intestines. When the ratio of tea to water was 6:100, more slowly digestible starch in the bread was produced, allowing for a steady and prolonged release of energy.

Ephedrine (EPH) is the main active component found in medicinal plants of the Ephedra genus and is commonly used to modulate inflammatory responses in various diseases. Hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha (HIF1α) is a subunit of hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF1), which plays a critical regulatory role in cellular responses under hypoxic conditions. Moreover, the degradation pathway of HIF1α is regulated by the deubiquitinase Ovarian Tumour Domain-containing Ubiquitin Aldehyde Binding Protein 1 (OTUB1). The aim of this study is to investigate the therapeutic effects of EPH on ALI and its potential therapeutic mechanism. We utilised a lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced ALI mouse model and employed various methods for evaluation. Ultimately, our research findings demonstrate that EPH exhibits anti-ALI effects, with the involvement of HIF1α and OTUB1 in the pharmacological actions of EPH.

This study evaluated the effects of heat-processed corn and enzyme supplementation in mash diets on nutrient digestibility, growth performance, intestinal morphology and ileal microbial count of broilers. Two trials were conducted. In Trial 1, the apparent metabolisable energy (AME) and apparent total tract retention (ATTR) of corn's nitrogen (N), dry matter (DM), calcium (Ca) and total phosphorus (TP) were determined. In Trial 2, a completely randomised design with a 4 × 2 factorial arrangement was used to assess the effects of processing temperatures (unprocessed or processed at 55°C, 70°C and 85°C) and enzyme supplementation (0 or 0.5 g/kg diet). A total of 480 25-day-old Ross 308 broilers were assigned to 48 experimental units with 8 treatments, 6 replicates and 10 chicks each. Heat processing at 85°C significantly increased the AME value of corn compared to unprocessed corn or corn processed at 55°C (p < 0.05). Additionally, processing at 55°C improved Ca digestibility compared to unprocessed corn (p < 0.05). Neither processing nor enzyme supplementation significantly affected the AMEn value or ATTR of crude protein (CP), DM or TP during Days 26‒28. Broilers fed diets with corn conditioned at 55°C or 70°C, both groups without enzyme supplementation, showed the lowest feed conversion ratio (FCR) (p < 0.05). Villi height was greater in broilers receiving processed corn compared to those consuming unprocessed corn (p < 0.05). Conditioning corn at 55°C resulted in a lower ileal Clostridium count at 42 d. Conditioning of corn at 55°C without enzyme supplementation in mash diets improved Ca utilisation, FCR and jejunal villus height while decreasing the ileal Clostridium count in broiler chicks.",,,

Unfortunately, the termination rate of clinical trials (CTs) testing potential OM interventions remains high. Here, we compared the characteristics of failed trials and matched completed trials to identify common features, which might inform better study design. CTs for the prevention/treatment of OM were identified using  Failed OM CTs were more likely to have academic sponsorship (45.7% vs. 39.1%), nonrandomized design (19.6% vs. 4.3%), and lower mean subject accrual (27.8 subjects vs. 101.4 subjects) compared to completed trials. The leading reason for termination was recruitment/enrollment (37.9%). Recruitment/enrollment and safety/efficacy accounted for failure in 84.6% of phase II trials. Contrary to general CTs where safety/efficacy concerns predominate, our results suggest OM-related trial failures are associated with a broader list of challenges including recruitment/enrollment, funding/sponsorship, and investigator/site issues.

VEGF ligands and their receptors orchestrate endothelial cell proliferation, migration, and survival, playing a pivotal role in dynamic vascular remodeling. Dysregulated VEGF signaling drives diverse pathological conditions, including tumor angiogenesis, cardiovascular diseases, and ocular disorders. Excessive VEGF activity promotes tumor growth, invasion, and metastasis, while insufficient signaling contributes to impaired wound healing and ischemic diseases. VEGF-targeted therapies, such as monoclonal antibodies and tyrosine kinase inhibitors, have revolutionized the treatment of diseases involving pathological angiogenesis, offering significant clinical benefits in oncology and ophthalmology. These therapies inhibit angiogenesis and slow disease progression, but they often face challenges such as therapeutic resistance, suboptimal efficacy, and adverse effects. To further explore these issues, this review provides a comprehensive overview of VEGF ligands and receptors, elucidating their molecular mechanisms and regulatory networks.

It systematically investigates the effects of HSP90 inhibitors, including AUY922, B11B021, CCT-018159, D7-gedunin, geldanamycin, and gedunin, across a range of cancer cell lines (HCC151, HT29, MCF7, PC3, VCAP, and A375) and a normal HA1E cell line, using data from the CLUE database. Our analysis reveals that treatment with these HSP90 inhibitors induces significant stress responses in tumor cells, initiating intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic pathways. The HSP90AA1, HSP90AB1, HSP27, HSP70, VEGF, and NOTCH exhibited notable upregulation at 24 h post-treatment compared to 6 h, indicating a time-dependent increase in cellular stress (heat shock response) and activation of pro-survival signaling mechanisms. Additionally, the study highlights a significant upregulation of immune-related pathways, including those involving IL10, IL3, and IL7, following HSP90 inhibition, indicating that these inhibitors not only directly affect tumor cell viability but also modulate the tumor microenvironment by enhancing immune cell activation and cytokine release. The elevated levels of IL10 point to a dual role, where immune suppression mechanisms are also at play, potentially facilitating immune evasion by the tumor. The findings suggest that HSP90 inhibitors exhibit varying mechanisms of action across different cancer cell lines despite the presence of some common targets. These insights highlight the need for further investigation into the precise mechanisms of HSP90 inhibitors to optimize their therapeutic potential in different cancers.",,,vibha@ibab.ac.in.

Malachite green (MG) dye is a hazardous chromatic compound predominantly utilized as a textile dye, exhibiting a strong affinity for the substrate to which it is applied. When diluted, it serves as antimicrobial agent for fungal and bacterial diseases in fish farms. However, the disposal of textile dyeing wastes pose significant environmental challenges, contaminating soil, surface water, and adversely affecting human health and aquatic life. R. mucilaginosa exhibits robust growth and resistance capabilities even under conditions of nutrient deficiency or external stress. This study focuses on optimizing the malachite green dye degradation ability of the yeast strain Rhodotorula mucilaginosa AUMC13567. The results reveal that the optimal conditions for maximum decolorization which was 100% at 50 mg/L dye concentration involve cultivating R. mucilaginosa on medium comprising distilled water with 3% glucose, 0.5% peptone, 0.3% malt extract, and 0.3% yeast extract under aerobic conditions at 37˚C for 12 h at 150 rpm. Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC/MS) analysis confirms the yeast's efficacy in degrading toxic MG dye complex compounds into simple harmless metabolites. Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) analyses show formation of novel compounds post the degradation of MG dye. Further research is advised to identify and characterize the specific enzymes or metabolic pathways implicated in MG dye degradation by R. mucilaginosa AUMC13567.

Genetic toxicology and environmental mutagenesis,10.1016/j.mrgentox.2025.503867,"Genotoxicity assessment is essential for ensuring chemical safety and mitigating risks to human health and the environment. Traditional methods, reliant on animal models, are time-consuming, costly, and raise ethical concerns. New Approach Methods (NAMs) offer innovative, cost-effective, and ethical alternatives, playing a pivotal role in both traditional and next-generation risk assessment (NGRA) by minimizing the need for animal testing, particularly in genotoxicity evaluations. However, the development of NAMs often overlooks the particular physicochemical properties of nanomaterials (NMs), which significantly influence their toxicological behaviour and can interfere with genotoxicity evaluation. This underscores an urgent need for the standardization and adaptation of NAMs to address nano- and advanced material-specific genotoxicity challenges. In this review, we summarize the challenges associated with genotoxicity testing of NMs and highlight the suitability of existing in vitro and in silico NAMs for NMs and advanced materials, enabling genotoxicity testing across various exposure routes and organ systems. Despite considerable progress, regulatory validation remains constrained by the absence of approved test guidelines and standardized protocols. To achieve regulatory acceptance, it is crucial to adapt NAMs to NM-specific exposure scenarios, refine test systems to better mimic human biology, develop tailored in vitro protocols, and ensure thorough characterisation of NMs both in pristine form and dispersed in culture medium.

The possibility of foodborne disease outbreaks as a result of biofilm-food cross-contamination is a distinct concern, along with the substantial costs associated with food spoilage and biofilm control. Besides, despite daily cleaning and disinfection, many bacteria grow in machines and surfaces in food processing plants, some of them forming biofilms. A promising procedure for disinfection and biofilm elimination could be the use of hybrid antimicrobial nanomaterials endowed with motion (i.e., nanomotors). Herein, we report Janus nanoparticles based on the conjunction of platinum and mesoporous silica nanoparticles, functionalized with a derivative of a natural antimicrobial compound, vanillin.

While propylene oxide fumigation is a common industrial pasteurization method, given the growing public concern about the use of synthetic chemicals, alternative methods with significant efficacy and minimal quality deterioration are needed. This study aimed to develop eco-friendly decontamination technology for raw almonds that includes natural-borne substance treatment and drying. The bactericidal effects of phytic acid (1, 2, 3 % (v/w)) and/or drying (6, 8 h at 75 °C) were investigated on Salmonella spp. (S. Enteritidis ATCC 13076, S. Enteritidis PT30, and S. Typhimurium DT104; ca. 3-4 or 6-7 log), which were artificially inoculated in raw almonds at moderate (ca. 3-4 log) or high (ca. 6-7 log) inoculum levels. Additionally, an enrichment test was conducted to validate the recovery of injured cells after treatment. The physicochemical, textural, and sensory attributes (color, pH, water activity, hardness; appearance, color, odor) of untreated/treated almonds were further analyzed. All individual treatments of 1-3 % phytic acid or 6-8 h of drying resulted in low antibacterial efficacies (< 1.0 log reduction from high inoculum and <2.1 log reduction from moderate inoculum; P < 0.05). For the high inoculum, 3 % phytic acid treatment followed by 8 h of drying achieved a >6.2 log reduction in Salmonella spp. in raw almonds (P < 0.05), and most of the injured bacterial cells (83.3 %) showed no recovery after enrichment. The equivalent treatment of almonds at a moderate inoculum level completely eliminated Salmonella spp. (> 3.1 log reduction; P < 0.05) without recovery. Moreover, the panelists indicated no significant differences (P > 0.05) in the tested sensory attributes (appearance, color, and odor) between the optimal treatment and the control, although some physicochemical properties were slightly affected. The results of this study suggest a novel decontamination method using a natural-borne substance that exerts a synergistic effect with drying against Salmonella spp. in raw almonds and ensures minimal deterioration in food quality. The developed method is expected to replace synthetic chemical decontamination methods in nuts and other low-moisture food industries.",,,rheems@korea.ac.kr.

These pathogenic bacteria may be inclined to be less reduced after washing or dipping in weak OAAs combined with salt, thereby posing a potential food safety hazard. Particularly, it can be plausible that E. coli has varied and different mechanisms to cope with the detrimental effects imposed by weak OAAs with one carboxyl functional group by the addition of ionic or nonionic solutes, including salt, KCl, sucrose, glutamate, and fructose. Nevertheless, little is known about the intracellular physiological response of Gram-negative bacteria subjected to a simultaneous challenge with weak OAAs and salt, as well as the underlying principles of an antagonistic phenomenon (protection) affordable to E. coli by the combined treatments. Therefore, the objectives of this review are to introduce the current propensity of individual or combined treatments with weak OAAs and salt for inactivating food-borne pathogens, to compile a selected area of studies focusing on the antagonistic interaction between short-chained weak OAAs and salt for inhibiting or eliminating Gram-negative bacteria, and then to uncover the putative mechanisms mediating the improved resistance of E. coli O157:H7 to weak acids by the salt amendment.",,,nina6026@hanmail.net.

A pivotal factor in this process is the accurate prediction of receptor-ligand interactions, which are critical for ensuring drug efficacy and safety. Traditional prediction methods are often time-consuming and resource-intensive, necessitating more efficient computational approaches. In this study, we present a machine learning framework that accurately predicts docking scores by integrating three complementary molecular representations: Lipinski descriptors, fingerprints, and graph-based representations. To enhance predictive performance, we proposed two fusion strategies: early fusion (feature-level integration) and late fusion (decision-level aggregation). Notably, the early fusion model outperformed other approaches, demonstrating that combining diverse molecular representations enhances both predictive accuracy and robustness. To further improve interpretability, we applied Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations method, which identified critical physicochemical and structural features driving predictions. This approach clarified binding dynamics by illustrating how specific features influence docking scores. Validation against established bioinformatics tools and 3D visualizations confirmed the framework's biological plausibility and reliability. By unifying multi-scale molecular representations with advanced machine learning techniques, our framework not only enhances prediction accuracy but also provides insights into ligand-receptor binding mechanisms. This advancement accelerates therapeutic development by enabling faster, data-driven prioritization of candidate molecules for complex diseases.",,,nissrinehatibi@gmail.com.

ICH Q3A provides a regulatory road map for PERLs but excludes biologic drugs like monoclonal antibody (mAb) therapies. Consequently, the industry lacks a synchronized, risk-based testing strategy for PERLs based on the likelihood of their presence in the final drug product. Ultrafiltration and diafiltration (UF/DF) operations have been demonstrated to clear leachables from the drug product during downstream purification. Hence, it is attractive to characterize PERL behavior during UF/DF to inform subsequent extractable and leachable (E&L) evaluation of the formulated biologic. The reduction capacity of twenty-two elements spiked into concentrated protein samples during UF/DF processes was investigated, using an inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) method, which was developed and validated according to ICH Q2 (R1) guidelines. Most elements (18) were efficiently cleared (>97 %), representing a 100-fold (2-log) reduction or higher after 10 diavolumes. Clearance was linked to UF/DF process parameters, most notably pH, as well as to the physicochemical properties of the studied elements. Mathematical models based on Orthogonal Partial Least Squares (OPLS) regression were developed and validated using the sieving coefficient to characterize and predict the clearance behavior of elemental impurities during UF/DF. Results from this study lay a solid foundation for the understanding and prediction of UF/DF capacity to remove elemental leachables. PERL clearance modelling emerges as a valuable platform to support industry and regulatory bodies in developing sophisticated risk-based PERL testing strategies, ultimately ensuring patient safety. The data presented herein demonstrate the significant risk reduction that the UF/DF process provides for processing steps upstream in mAbs and other biologics processes.",Hayes R; Felice C; Sexton A; Wang PP,Manufacturing Science and Technology; Material Sciences at Biotherapeutics Development & Supply; Material Sciences at Discovery,jonathan.bones@nibrt.ie.

Patients with this disorder often face significant challenges in diagnosis, treatment, and access to care due to their rare nature and limited understanding and treatment options. In recent years, significant advancements have been made in the global healthcare in addressing the accessibility of essential treatments and medicines, but still challenges persist particularly related to orphan drugs (to treat rare diseases) in the developing world. The accessibility of orphan drugs remains a major challenge, where patients face barriers such as high costs, limited availability, and inadequate healthcare infrastructure. The high cost associated with orphan drugs presents a barrier to affordability for both patients and healthcare systems, causing disparities in access to life-saving treatments. The molecular farming approach utilizing plant-based production systems for recombinant protein production offers a hope for overcoming barriers to orphan drug access in resource-constrained settings. Molecular farming has the potential to produce a wide range of therapeutic proteins and biologics for the treatment of various rare diseases. The FDA approval of plant-derived proteins for the treatment of Gaucher disease (Elelyso) and Fabry disease (Elfabrio) highlights the potential of plant-based expression systems for the development of suitable drugs targeting niche and orphan diseases.

Closed System Transfer Devices (CSTD) are widely used for the preparation and administration of hazardous drugs. Recent literature has raised concerns about potential under- or over-dosing when doses are prepared using CSTD due to their high hold-up volume. To ensure dose accuracy, it is essential to follow proper preparation methods when using CSTD. Seven commonly used CSTD were evaluated for product transfer accuracy from vials to IV bags using four methods: no bag spike flushing, flushing bag spikes with the original syringes, flushing bag spikes with new syringes, and circle priming. The data confirmed that under- and over-dosing occurred frequently at transfer volume ≤ 2 mL when not flushing bag spikes or flushing bag spikes with the original syringes as suggested by some manufacturers' instructions. The study also demonstrated that flushing bag spikes with the new syringes or using circle priming is effective in enabling accurate volume transfer from vials to IV bags at transfer volumes ≤ 2 mL. Both methods are feasible for implementation in pharmacies or hospitals to ensure dose preparation accuracy using CSTD. It is recommended that clinical sites flush bag spikes with the new syringes or use circle priming method for low volume transfer to ensure dose preparation accuracy.

However, this assessment can be constrained by limited API availability. Present methods to assess risk in industry relies on larger volume equipment such as a compaction simulator or texture analyser (TA) that requires larger quantities of API. In the present study, a diamond anvil cell (DAC) was used, that reduces the quantity of material even further to micrograms to investigate the impact of pressure using Hydrochlorothiazide (HCT) as a model API. The powdered API was directly loaded into the DAC sample chamber without a pressure-transmitting medium (PTM), and Raman spectroscopy was used to monitor form changes. A polymorphic transition begins to be observed at 300 MPa pressure in the DAC that is commensurate with the findings in the TA (500 MPa) from Raman and X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD). XRPD analysis revealed that trituration likely causes a transformation back to the original phase as undisturbed samples can be stored for months. In conclusion, the study highlights the effectiveness of the DAC as a material sparing technique for assessing pressure induced polymorphic transition in APIs at the time of compression enabling a real-time monitoring of the process. The DAC successfully detected the polymorphic transition in tabletting compression range requiring significantly less material than the TA. The minimal consumption of API making DAC a preferred method for polymorphic screening particularly at the early stage of development when material availability is limited.",Doherty CL,Medicinal Science & Technology,iain.oswald@strath.ac.uk.

Rodent human equivalent dose-adjusted LOAEL (LOAELHED) values and human LOAEL values for the sensitive effect in each species were moderately correlated in a protective context. When matched rodent and human effects were evaluated, the quantitative correlation in dose did not improve, and the qualitative balanced accuracy in effects was low suggesting limited predictivity. Absolute differences in rodent LOAELHED and human LOAEL values were nearly 1 log10 unit with rodent LOAELHED values consistently higher; however, rodent LOAELHED values were less than the human LOAEL values for >95% of drugs when divided by typical composite uncertainty factors. In comparison, in vitro bioactivity administered equivalent dose (AED) values showed a similar moderate correlation and absolute differences with human LOAEL values, but in vitro bioactivity AED values were consistently lower. When in vitro bioactivity AED values were compared with rodent LOAELHED values, the correlation was lower and differences larger relative to human LOAEL comparison.

The empty and full ratio is a critical quality attribute in the quality control (QC) of rAAV, and its accurate evaluation is crucial for ensuring the safety, effectiveness, and consistency of gene therapy products. Analytical ultracentrifugation (AUC) technology, with its high resolution and accuracy, is widely recognized by the industry as the gold standard for identifying the empty and full ratio of rAAV. However, the conventional sedimentation velocity analytical ultracentrifugation (SV-AUC) method has limited throughput, failing to meet the large-scale detection needs of rAAV in process development and QC. This study aims to develop a single-sector higher throughput SV-AUC method without the need for a reference sector for blank control in order to improve the throughput of detecting the empty and full ratio of rAAV vectors. We optimized the traditional double-sector SV-AUC method, which requires a reference sector for blank control in the cell. By converting the light intensity data of AUC into pseudo-absorbance data, we significantly improve the analytical throughput. By tracking the variation of light intensity data with radius, we could clearly observe the sedimentation process of the rAAV sample. Despite a difference in the absolute value of pseudo-absorbance, the accurately fitted relative absorbance value and the traditional SV-AUC absorbance value with blank control were comparable, further verifying the applicability of this upgraded rAAV analytical method. The detailed comparison and verification between the upgraded method and the traditional SV-AUC method showed that the consistency and repeatability of the percentage and sedimentation coefficient were excellent both within the same cell and across different cells. The analysis results of samples from seven independent cells with a total of 14 sectors showed that the overall data exhibited good repeatability. The consistency of the high percentage empty capsid (HE) samples repeatability results was good, and the overlay of the C(s) distribution diagram also showed good pattern consistency. The relative standard deviation of the average percentage of empty, partial, and full capsids was maintained within 5%. The upgraded method demonstrated excellent consistency and repeatability in the analysis of rAAV samples with different empty and full ratios, aligning closely with the data obtained with the traditional SV-AUC method, the gold standard. Linear correlation analysis between the titers of HE samples and the overall absorbance (A value) of AUC, as well as the absorbance of empty, partial, and full capsids, revealed a good linear relationship, further confirming the applicability and reliability of the upgraded AUC method for evaluating rAAV samples with different titers. We also preliminarily explored the robustness of this method and found that even in the presence of slight fluctuations in sample volume, the test results remained stable, effectively alleviating concerns about the impact of inaccurate sample volume on the results. By dropping ink to simulate window contamination or wear, it was found that although the peak shape of the C(s) distribution was affected, the ratio results were consistent with those of the traditional SV-AUC method, proving that the new method exhibits good anti-interference ability under varying testing conditions. We conducted a comparability study on rAAV samples containing different proportions of empty, partial, and full capsids. rAAV samples with different proportions of empty and full showed high consistency and repeatability in the results obtained from both methods. In summary, the single-sector higher throughput SV-AUC method without a reference sector for blank control proposed in this study not only improves the analysis efficiency of rAAV samples but also ensures the accuracy and precision of the results, providing a new reliable analysis tool with higher throughput for gene therapy. This technology is expected to accelerate the development and evaluation process of gene therapy products.",Yu Q; Zhang D; Jiang W; Cai Z; Hou W; Bhattacharya A; Yang Y; Wang C; Ye M; Huo D,Belief BioMed Inc.; Beckman Coulter Life Sciences,

However, the lack of a clear and reasonable co-assembly strategy has hindered the wide application and promotion of drug-co assembly. This paper introduces a deep learning-based sonosensitizer-drug interaction (SDI) model to predict the particle size of the drug mixture. To analyze the factors influencing the particle size after mixing, the graph neural network is employed to capture the atomic, bond, and structural features of the molecules. A multi-scale cross-attention mechanism is designed to integrate the feature representations of different scale substructures of the two drugs, which not only improves prediction accuracy but also allows for the analysis of the impact of molecular structures on the predictions. Ablation experiments evaluate the impact of molecular properties, and comparisons with other machine and deep learning methods show superiority, achieving 90.00% precision, 96.00% recall, and 91.67% F1-score. Furthermore, the SDI predicts the co-assembly of the chemotherapy drug methotrexate (MET) and the sonosensitizer emodin (EMO) to form the nanomedicine NanoME. This prediction is further validated through experiments, demonstrating that NanoME can be used for fluorescence imaging of liver cancer and sonodynamic/chemotherapy anticancer therapy.",,,

In recent years, China has introduced a new evidence system for the review and approval of TCM products, which proposed using human-use experience (HUE) for real-world evidence (RWE) to support the safety and effectiveness of TCM. This study aimed to comprehensively analyse the regulatory concerns, policy guidances, and approved cases of using HUE to register TCM products. Literature search and thematic analysis were conducted to identify and synthesize the regulatory concerns. A documentary analysis of policy guidances was employed to present the evolving regulatory framework for incorporating HUE into TCM registration in China. Case studies of approved TCM products using HUE to support registration were conducted, and the study design, study population, and postmarked requirements of these cases were analyzed. Four main themes and 12 sub-themes regarding regulatory concerns of applying HUE in the registration of TCM products were identified. The 4 main themes are HUE quality, HUE applicability, HUE governance, and HUE regulation. Six policy documents and seven technical guidances were released to facilitate the application of HUE in TCM registration, founding a practical regulatory framework for TCM product registration. In China, six cases that employed HUE to support registration were approved. Of these, five cases utilized HUE to support direct registration, while one utilized HUE to lay the foundation for subsequent phase III clinical trial. Regarding study design and data types, retrospective observational studies were the predominant approach and electronic health records from the hospital information systems were the most commonly used data source. Among the five cases of direct registration, three relied solely on retrospective observational studies, while two conducted small-sample prospective studies in conjunction with retrospective observational studies. HUE can be advanced to generate RWE for the safety and effectiveness of TCM products, which provides potential support for registering new TCM products. Leveraging HUE for registration can shorten research and development period, reduce development costs, and promote innovation, ultimately driving the growth of the TCM industry. However, several challenges remain in using HUE to support the registration of TCM products in China, including difficulties in data accessibility, lack of standardized protocols for HUE collection and reporting, and obstacles in transforming TCM preparations from hospitals into new TCM products using HUE.

In parallel, clinical researchers, chemists, biochemists, and molecular biologists have endeavored to translate these molecular tools into clinical imaging agents. Despite these efforts, there are no clinically approved imaging methodologies with which to image cell death consistently and quantitatively. One reason may reside in the intrinsic mismatch between the sampling frequency of translational molecular imaging and the biochemical kinetics that define cell death. Beyond cell death imaging, many active research programs are now attempting to create translational diagnostic pharmaceuticals to image immunological, fibrotic, amyloidotic, and metabolic pathways. Each of these pathways is defined by a unique set of biochemical rate constants, some of which are associated with key predictive pathways. Exhaustively sampling all permutations of pathways and kinetic constants would seem to be an intractable strategy for target identification and validation. Sampling theory, if applied to these pathways, could accelerate the translation of high-impact diagnostics through prioritization of pathways for either AI enhanced diagnostic imaging or AI-enhanced wearable devices. In this perspective, we identify the Nyquist sampling rate as a key criterion for evaluating the optimal application for novel diagnostics. Sampling theory states that to fully characterize a band-limited, stationary, temporal data set, the signal must be sampled at more than twice the rate of the fastest frequency in the signal or, for diagnostics, the discriminatory signal. Through the study of the medical imaging process chain, Nyquist sampling rates of 0.25 day",,,

However, the current practice of drug development is time-consuming and requires a lot of investment by the pharmaceutical industries. Currently, it takes around 8-10 years and $3 billion of investment to develop a medication. Pharmaceutical industries and regulatory authorities are continuing to adopt new technologies to improve the efficiency of the drug development process. However, over the decades the pharmaceutical industries were not able to accelerate the drug development process. The pandemic (COVID-19) has taught the pharmaceutical industries and regulatory agencies an expensive lesson showing the need for emergency preparedness by accelerating the drug development process. Over the last few years, the pharmaceutical industries have been collaborating with artificial intelligence (AI) companies to develop algorithms and models that can be implemented at various stages of the drug development process to improve efficiency and reduce the developmental timelines significantly. In recent years, AI-screened drug candidates have entered clinical testing in human subjects which shows the interest of pharmaceutical companies and regulatory agencies. End-end integration of AI within the drug development process will benefit the industries for predicting the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles, toxicity, acceleration of clinical trials, study design, virtual monitoring of subjects, optimization of manufacturing process, analyzing and real-time monitoring of product quality, and regulatory preparedness.

To evaluate the spread of AMR bacteria, the reservoir of AMR genes (resistome) has been identified in environmental samples, hospital environments, and human populations, but the functional role of AMR bacteria and their persistence within individuals has not been fully investigated. Here, we performed a strain-resolved in-depth analysis of the resistome changes by reconstructing a large number of metagenome-assembled genomes from the gut microbiome of an antibiotic-treated individual. Interestingly, we identified two bacterial populations with different resistome profiles: extensively acquired antimicrobial-resistant bacteria (EARB) and sporadically acquired antimicrobial-resistant bacteria, and found that EARB showed broader drug resistance and a significant functional role in shaping individual microbiome composition after antibiotic treatment. Our findings of AMR bacteria would provide a new avenue for controlling the spread of AMR bacteria in the human community.",,,leesunjae@gist.ac.kr.

The present work reports a comparative HPLC-DAD study of the polyphenolic composition of the crude extracts of Epilobium angustifolium and Epilobium hirsutum. Oenothein B, gallic acid, hyperoside, and isoquercitin were the dominant phenolic compounds. E. hirsutum methanol extract showed a high radical scavenging activity as demonstrated by the HPLC-ABTS assay due to its richness in phenolic compounds. The polysaccharide-rich extracts and water extracts of E. hirsutum showed potent anti-coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 activity against the Omicron strain at 10 μg/mL with inhibition percentages of 38.4% and 46.1%, respectively. In contrast, the methanol (50% v/v) extract was inactive. Rutin and chlorogenic acid docked well into the binding pocket of the coronavirus spike protein.

Furthermore, it had no effect on reducing IOP spikes or the development of PAS. To evaluate the effect of postoperative pilocarpine use on intraocular pressure (IOP), glaucoma medications, and complications in patients undergoing Gonioscopy-assisted transluminal trabeculotomy (GATT). This retrospective study included patients with ocular hypertension or primary open-angle glaucoma who underwent stand-alone GATT or combined with cataract extraction between June 2021 and April 2023. Participants were divided into a pilocarpine group (n=28) and a control group (n=25). Pilocarpine 2% was administered twice daily for 4 weeks following surgery in the pilocarpine group. Outcomes including IOP, visual acuity, glaucoma medication use, and complications were assessed at multiple postoperative intervals up to 12 months. Baseline characteristics were similar between groups. Surgical success rates at 12 months were 80.8% for the pilocarpine group and 79.2% for the control group (P=0.999). No significant differences in IOP reduction were found at any follow-up visit. Considering pilocarpine as 1 drug, the mean number of medications was higher in the pilocarpine group from day 1 to month 1 after surgery (P<0.001). However, from the third month through the 12-month follow-up, the study groups were comparable. Although postoperative complications were similar, on the first postoperative day, five patients (17.9%) in the pilocarpine group exhibited hyphema ≥25%, whereas none in the control group did (P=0.053). Routine postoperative pilocarpine use following GATT did not appear to significantly impact surgical outcomes or complication rates.

Co-crystallization, where pairs of molecules form a multicomponent crystal, constitutes a promising strategy to enhance physicochemical properties without compromising pharmacological activity. However, finding promising co-crystal pairs is resource-intensive, due to the large and diverse range of possible molecular combinations. We present DeepCocrystal, a novel deep learning approach designed to predict co-crystal formation by processing the ""chemical language"" from a supramolecular vantage point. Rigorous validation of DeepCocrystal showed a balanced accuracy of 78% in realistic scenarios, outperforming existing models. Explainable AI approaches uncovered the decision-making process of DeepCocrystal, showing its capability to learn chemically relevant aspects of the ""supramolecular language"" that match experimental co-crystallization patterns. By leveraging properties of molecular string representations, DeepCocrystal can also estimate the uncertainty of its predictions. We harness this capability in a challenging prospective study and successfully discovered two novel co-crystals of diflunisal, an anti-inflammatory drug. This study underscores the potential of deep learning - and in particular of chemical language processing - to accelerate co-crystallization and ultimately drug development, in both academic and industrial contexts. DeepCocrystal is available as an easy-to-use web application at https://deepcocrystal.streamlit.app/.",Aramini A,Dompé farmaceutici SpA: Dompe farmaceutici SpA,

It is characterized by excessive extracellular matrix deposition resulting from sustained liver injury, often advancing to cirrhosis and cancer. As its progression involves various cell types and pathogenic factors, understanding the intricate mechanisms is essential for the development of effective therapies. In this context, extensive efforts have been made to establish three-dimensional (3D) in vitro platforms that mimic the progression of liver fibrosis. This review outlines the pathophysiology of liver fibrosis and highlights recent advancements in 3D in vitro liver models, including spheroids, organoids, assembloids, bioprinted constructs, and microfluidic systems. It further assesses their biological relevance, with particular focus on their capacity to reproduce fibrosis-related characteristics. 3D in vitro liver models offer significant advantages over conventional two-dimensional cultures. Although each model exhibits unique strengths, they collectively recapitulate key fibrotic features, such as extracellular matrix remodeling, hepatic stellate cell activation, and collagen deposition, in a physiologically relevant 3D setting. In particular, multilineage liver organoids and assembloids integrate architectural complexity with scalability, enabling deeper mechanistic insights and supporting therapeutic evaluation with improved translational relevance. 3D in vitro liver models represent a promising strategy to bridge the gap between in vitro studies and in vivo realities by faithfully replicating liver-specific architecture and microenvironments. With enhanced reproducibility through standardized protocols, these models hold great potential for advancing drug discovery and facilitating the development of personalized therapies for liver fibrosis.",,,jhkim@korea.ac.kr.

The aim of this study was to delineate a prototype process for and then, following this process, develop questionnaires to rigorously assess patient-centric treatment preferences, using pediatric growth hormone deficiency (PGHD) treatment as a model. A literature review and concept elicitation interviews with clinical experts (n=5), caregivers of children with PGHD (n=15), and children with PGHD (n=15) were conducted. Most respondents were on injectable treatments with a small subsample on an investigational oral treatment. Data were analyzed based on adapted ground theory, and the GHD-Preference Measure (GHD-PRM), and GHD-Attribute Measure (GHD-ATM) were developed. These questionnaires were cognitively debriefed, refined, and finalized. Best practices for patient-reported outcome measure development and guidelines on assessing patient preferences were followed. Beyond efficacy, some of the most important treatment aspects determining preference for caregivers were the ease of preparation/setup, convenience, and side effects. The most frequently reported reasons for missing, postponing, or changing their child's medication (eg, dosage) included travel/being away from home and flexibility of dosing. The most frequently reported treatment impacts on children's daily lives were travel/being away from home, social activities/relationships, and evening routine/schedule. Findings were generally similar between caregivers and children, and those on injectable vs oral treatment. The GHD-PRM is intended for use when treatment comparisons are appropriate; the GHD-ATM is intended for use when treatment comparisons are not available. Each has a caregiver and child version. The GHD-PRM and GHD-ATM can be considered disease-specific prototype preference and attribute questionnaires developed according to a rigorous patient-centric process.

This study aimed to investigate the effects and mechanisms of sub-MICs of commonly used antibiotics on the biofilm formation of a S. aureus strain Guangzhou-SAU071 which displays weak biofilm formation despite harboring biofilm-associated genes. CV and MTS assays were used to determine biofilm biomass and cell viability, respectively. Dual-omics sequencing combining genomics and transcriptomics was used to study the global expression changes. Expression of biofilm and two-component system associated genes was further verified by RT-qPCR. Biofilm formation of Guangzhou-SAU071 was enhanced under sub-MIC of ciprofloxacin (2 μg/mL) and streptomycin (128 μg/mL). Nearly half of the genes associated with biofilm formation, cell wall anchoring, and two-component systems exhibited significant differential expression under sub-MIC of ciprofloxacin and streptomycin. As concluded, sub-MIC of ciprofloxacin and streptomycin enhanced biofilm formation of S. aureus, possibly due to its regulation on biofilm and two-component system associated genes.",,,zhenbo.xu@hotmail.com.

The development of multifunctional food packaging materials offers an innovative and effective strategy to mitigate this issue. In this study, we successfully synthesized the water-soluble Silver - polylysine - diethyl ferulate (Ag-PLL-DEF) polymer using a CuAAC reaction and an in situ growth method, which enhanced the dispersibility of diethyl ferulate (DEF) in aqueous solutions. This polymer was then blended with Polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) to create the Ag-PLL-DEF/PVA composite film. Our results demonstrate that incorporating DEF significantly improved the UV resistance of the composite film, with the UV shield rate of the 0.8 wt% Ag-PLL-DEF/PVA composite film reaching 98.62 %. After 30 days of continuous UV irradiation, the composite film exhibited outstanding light stability. The incorporation of Ag and PLL conferred remarkable antibacterial properties to the composite film. The inhibitory zone diameters of the 0.8 wt% Ag-PLL-DEF/PVA composite film against E. coli and S. aureus were 3.3 ± 0.2 mm and 2.75 ± 0.15 mm, respectively. Furthermore, a strawberry preservation experiment confirmed that the Ag-PLL-DEF/PVA composite film effectively inhibited bacterial growth and extended the shelf life of strawberries by up to 7 days.

Herein, the green sichuan pepper essential oil (GSPO) with natural antibacterial and antioxidant effects was added in SPI to prepare SPI-GSPO emulsion film, and the physicochemical properties and antioxidant/antibacterial activity of SPI-GSPO emulsion films were comprehensively evaluated. The results showed that the particle size of SPI-GSPO pre-emulsions decreased and the zeta potential increased as the increasing content of GSPO, providing a well-structured pre-emulsion for the preparation of film. The transparency value, L* and a* of films improved, while the b*, swelling ratio (SR), water solubility (WS), WVP, moisture content (MC), and ΔE decreased due to more hydrogen bonds formation that replaced hydrophilicity interaction when GSPO incorporated into SPI film. The antibacterial activity of SPI-GSPO emulsion film enhanced with the incorporation of GSPO. Furthermore, the mechanical properties, including tensile strength (TS), elongation at break (EAB), and antioxidant activity improved with GSPO added and reached the maximum value of SPI-GSPO-1.0 emulsion film. Meanwhile, the upper surface and cross-section structure of SPI-GSPO-1.0 emulsion film showed smooth and uniform.

To address these limitations, a self-assembling material SPI/SA/GSH (SSG) was developed by introducing glutathione (GSH) into a soy protein isolate (SPI) - sodium alginate (SA). The cinnamon essential oil (CEO) was encapsulated within this self-assembling material using homogenization and sonication techniques, to enhance its preservation capabilities. The solutions and emulsions composed of SPI, SA, SPI/SA physical complex (SS) and SSG particles were compared and evaluated for their structural characteristics and stability, indicating that the introduction of GSH promoted the self-assembly of protein-polysaccharide complexes by breaking disulfide bonds, thereby improving the emulsification and stability of the system. The antibacterial assays showed that the SSG emulsion effectively inhibited the growth of Escherichia coli (E. coli) and Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus). Notably, the SSG displayed a sustained-release effect for CEO, highlighting its potential for controlled-release applications. Furthermore, fresh-cut cantaloupe treated with the SSG coating experienced reduced mass loss and retained firmness, while maintaining levels of ascorbic acid, total soluble solids (TSS), and titratable acidity (TA) compared to other treatments.

40355953,Promoting cytidine biosynthesis by modulating pyrimidine metabolism and carbon metabolic regulatory networks in Bacillus subtilis.,2025-05-13,Microbial cell factories,10.1186/s12934-025-02731-y,"The modification of single or multiple genes via metabolic engineering can lead to the dysregulation of central metabolism and affect bacterial growth and metabolite accumulation. Meanwhile, transcription factor engineering can trigger metabolic network reprogramming at the global or systemic level, redirecting metabolic flux toward the synthetic pathways of target metabolites. In this study, we modulated pyrimidine and carbon-nitrogen metabolism in Bacillus subtilis through transcription factor engineering to promote the synthesis of cytidine, a drug intermediate. First, cytidine synthesis was enhanced by knocking out the transcriptional regulator PyrR, which increased the cytidine titer during shake flask fermentation to 0.67 g/L. Second, mutations in the transcriptional regulator catabolite control protein A (CcpA) significantly promoted cytidine synthesis, increasing the shake flask titer to 2.03 g/L. Finally, after culture in a 5 L fermenter, the cytidine titer reached 7.65 g/L, which was 3.77-fold that of shake flask fermentation. Moreover, a cytidine yield and productivity of 0.06 g/g glucose and 0.16 g/L/h, respectively, were achieved. Subsequently, the regulatory mechanisms through which PyrR and CcpA modification affect cytidine biosynthesis were explored through multi-omics analysis. Transcriptome and metabolome analysis revealed that coordinated alterations in carbon, nitrogen, nucleotide, and amino acid metabolism were essential to promote cytidine synthesis. However, the increased cytidine production in recombinant strains was attributed to the enhancement of pyrimidine metabolism, the Phosphotransferase (PTS) system, the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, the pentose phosphate (PP) pathway, and nitrogen metabolism. These results indicate that PyrR knockdown can enhance pyrimidine metabolic pathway and promote cytidine synthesis. CcpA mutation can reprogram the central carbon-nitrogen metabolic network, change the metabolic flow to de novo synthesis pathway of pyrimidine nucleoside, increase the supply of cytidine synthesis precursors and promote the accumulation of cytidine. Overall, regulation of engineered carbon and nitrogen metabolic networks is essential for improving the efficiency of microbial cell factories.",,,fanght@nxu.edu.cn.

To understand this influence, we conducted a qualitative study of documents related to the development of a tool that relied on artificial intelligence (AI) to suggest modifications in opioid prescribing, called NarxCare. The study began with keyword searches of the Opioid Industry Document Archive (OIDA), which contained over 3 million documents at the time of the study, to examine the pharmaceutical industry's role in shaping the digital transformation of opioid prescribing. Our findings highlight industry-driven investments, educational campaigns, corporate policy activities, and the reliance on proprietary data that facilitated the widespread implementation of NarxCare. The increasing reliance on NarxCare raises concerns about its limited transparency, unknown reliability, and potential bias which may disproportionately affect certain patient groups based on race, socioeconomic status, or health conditions. This paper argues that the promotion of technologies like NarxCare allows the pharmaceutical industry to reinforce the narrative that opioids can be effective when prescribed responsibly, using advanced, data-driven strategies. Marketed as tools that assist clinicians in making more informed prescribing decisions, NarxCare contributes to the portrayal of the industry as a responsible actor in the regulation and distribution of opioids. Shifting attention to individual risk factors rather than systemic challenges enables the pharmaceutical industry to sidestep its role in the opioid crisis and evade scrutiny for its influence over regulation, the sponsorship of education and research, lobbying, supply chain control, and public health narratives. While NarxCare aims to improve prescribing safety, it requires critical evaluation in terms of effectiveness, ethical considerations, and the continued influence of the pharmaceutical industry in its design and implementation.",,,kelly.knight@ucsf.edu.

This analysis aimed to determine if a machine learning algorithm capable of predicting impending exacerbations could be developed using data from an integrated digital inhaler. A 12-week, open-label clinical study enrolled patients (≥40 years old) with COPD to use ProAir Digihaler, a digital dry powder inhaler with integrated sensors, to deliver their reliever medication (albuterol, 90 µg/dose; 1-2 inhalations every 4 hours, as needed). The Digihaler recorded inhaler use through timestamps, peak inspiratory flow (PIF), inhalation volume, inhalation duration, and time to PIF throughout the study. By applying machine learning methodology to data downloaded from the inhalers after study completion, along with clinical and demographic information, a model predictive of impending exacerbations was generated. The predictive analysis included 336 patients, 98 of whom experienced a total of 111 exacerbations. PIF and inhalation volume were observed to decline in the days preceding an exacerbation. Using gradient-boosting trees with data from the Digihaler and baseline patient characteristics, the machine learning model was able to predict an exacerbation over the following 5 days with a receiver operating characteristic area under curve of 0.77 (95% CI: 0.71-0.83). Features of the model with the highest weight were baseline inhalation parameters and changes in inhalation parameters before an exacerbation compared with baseline.

This strain had significant inhibitory effects on various postharvest disease pathogens in crops, such as Botrytis cinerea, as well as soil-borne disease pathogens in ginseng, such as Sclerotinia ginseng. In order to accelerate its industrialization process, in this study, single-factor experiments and response surface optimization methods were used. The fermentation medium and fermentation conditions in the shake flask of strain JA20-1 were systematically optimized by using cell production volume as the response variable. Meanwhile, the biocontrol effect of JA20-1 on B. cinerea of ginseng during the storage period was evaluated by using the method of fumigation in a dry dish in vitro. The results indicated that the optimal fermentation medium formulation for strain JA20-1 was as follows: 1% yeast paste, 1% soluble starch, 0.25% K_2HPO_4·3H_2O, and 0.2% NaCl. The optimal fermentation conditions in the shake flask were vaccination size of 3%, culture volume of 50 mL in a 250 mL Erlenmeyer flask, pH of 6.2, fermentation temperature of 34 ℃, shaking speed of 180 r·min~(-1), and incubation time of 18 hours.

Damping off is one of the most important seedling diseases affecting A. kusnezoffii, occurring widely and often causing large-scale seedling death in the field. To clarify the species of the pathogen causing damping off in A. kusnezoffii and to formulate an effective control strategy, this study conducted pathogen identification, research on biological characteristics, and evaluation of fungicide inhibitory activity. Through morphological characteristics, cultural traits, and phylogenetic tree analysis, the pathogen causing damping off in A. kusnezoffii was identified as Rhizoctonia solani, belonging to the AG5 anastomosis group. The optimal temperature for mycelial growth of the pathogen was 25-30 ℃, with OA medium as the most suitable medium, pH 8 as the optimal pH, and sucrose and yeast as the best carbon and nitrogen sources, respectively. The effect of light on mycelial growth was not significant. In evaluating the inhibitory activity of 45 chemical fungicides, including 30% hymexazol, and 4 biogenic fungicides, including 0.3% eugenol, it was found that 30% thifluzamide and 50% fludioxonil had significantly better inhibitory effects on R. solani than other tested agents, with EC_(50) values of 0.129 6,0.220 6 μg·mL~(-1), respectively. Among the biogenic fungicides, 0.3% eugenol also showed an ideal inhibitory effect on the pathogen, with an EC_(50) of 1.668 9 μg·mL~(-1). To prevent the development of resistance in the pathogen and to reduce the use of chemical fungicides, it is recommended that the three fungicides above be used in rotation during production. These findings provide a theoretical basis for the accurate diagnosis and effective control strategy for R. solani causing damping off in A. kusnezoffii.",,,

Rapid identification and classification of the main chemical components were performed,and the therapeutic effects of Xiangmei Pills on the proteins and intestinal flora of UC rats were analyzed to explore the mechanism of its action in treating UC. Fifty SD rats were acclimatized to feeding for 3 d and randomly divided into blank group, model group,mesalazine group(0. 4 g·kg~(-1)), low-dose group of Xiangmei Pills(1. 89 g·kg~(-1)), and high-dose group of Xiangmei Pills(5. 67 g·kg~(-1)), with 10 rats in each group. 5% dextrose sodium sulfate(DSS) was given by gavage to induce the male SD rat model with UC,and the corresponding medicinal solution was given by gavage after 10 days, respectively. The therapeutic effect of Xiangmei Pills on rats with UC was evaluated according to body mass, disease activity index(DAI), and hematoxylin-eosin(HE) staining, and the histopathological changes in the colon were observed. Ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole/electrostatic field orbitrap high-resolution mass spectrometry(UHPLC-Q-Orbitrap HRMS) technique was used to rapidly and accurately identify the main chemical constituents of Xiangmei Pills. Immunohistochemistry was used to detect the expression of aryl hydrocarbon receptor(AhR),interferon-γ(IFN-γ), mucin-2(MUC-2), and cytochrome P450 1A1(CYP1A1) in colon tissue. Interleukin-22(IL-22) expression in colon tissue was detected by immunofluorescence. The 16S r DNA high-throughput sequencing technique was used to study the modulatory effects of Xiangmei Pills on the intestinal flora structure of rats with UC. Pharmacodynamic results showed that compared with that of the blank group, the colon tissue of the model group was congested, and ulcers were visible in the mucosa; compared with that in the model group, the histopathology of the colon of the rats with UC in the groups of Xiangmei Pills were improved, with scattered ulcers and reduced inflammatory cell infiltration. Chemical analysis showed that a total of 45 components were identified by mass spectrometry information, including 15 phenolic acids, 8 coumarins, 15 organic acids, 3 amino acids, 2 flavonoids, and 2 other components. Compared with those in the blank group, the levels of Ah R, CYP1A1, MUC-2, and IL-22 proteins in the colon tissue of rats in the model group were significantly decreased, and the level of IFN-γ protein was significantly increased; the intestinal flora of rats in the model group was disorganized, with a decrease in the abundance of the flora; the relative abundance of Bacteroidetes,unclassified genera of Ascomycetes, Prevotella of the Prevotella family, and Prevotella decreased significantly, and that of Firmicutes decreased, but the difference was not statistically significant.

However, clear evidence guiding how long bisphosphonate treatment should be paused before dental surgery remains limited. Here we show that a longer time since the last dose of intravenous bisphosphonate is associated with a reduced risk of jawbone necrosis. Using a nationwide retrospective cohort of 152,299 older adults diagnosed with osteoporosis, we analyze the relationship between the duration of bisphosphonate discontinuation prior to dental extraction and the occurrence of osteonecrosis of the jaw. We find that the risk is substantially lower when treatment is paused for more than 90 days, and lowest when the pause exceeds one year. The risk reduction appears more consistent with ibandronate, whereas with zoledronate, only pauses longer than one year show a meaningful association. These findings underscore the potential value of personalized prevention strategies based on bisphosphonate type.",,,periolee@gmail.com.

Chemotherapy is the mainstay treatment approach. Cannabidiol (CBD), the main non-psychoactive cannabinoid, has shown a potential anticancer activity in TNBC, enhancing the effect of conventional antineoplastics. This research aims to develop in situ forming implants (ISFIs) as a long-acting depot formulation of CBD with potential application in TNBC. This formulation is intended to be administered in the tumor site during neoadjuvant chemotherapeutic regimens, allowing a controlled CBD release. ISFIs were elaborated with 100 mg of polycaprolactone (PCL) and 2.5 mg (2.5-CB-ISFI), 5 mg (5-CB-ISFI) or 10 mg (10-CB-ISFI) of CBD dissolved in 400 µL of NMP. All the formulations exhibited a controlled drug release for around two months. 10-CB-ISFI formulation with the highest CBD content and the most suitable CBD release profile was selected for biological studies. This formulation inhibited the proliferation and migration of MDA-MB-231 and 4T1 cells and exerted an antiangiogenic effect in ovo. Interestingly, the antiangiogenic activity of 10-CB-ISFI was higher compared with CBD in solution administered at the same concentration, showing vascular inhibition percentages of around 80 % and 60 %, respectively. Finally, this formulation reduced the growth of MDA-MB-231-derived tumors developed in the chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) model. The single administration of 10-CB-ISFI exhibited a similar antitumor efficacy to the daily administration of CBD in solution (≈60 % tumor growth inhibition). Therefore, the injectable depot formulation of CBD developed in this work showed a promising utility in TNBC treatment.",,,aifraguas@ucm.es.

Bipyridyl herbicides (BPyHs), a class of highly effective and broad-spectrum herbicides, cannot be used as pre-emergence herbicides because they can be absorbed and inactivated by negatively charged soil after application. Here, we design and fabricate an adsorbed-but-active supramolecular pre-emergence herbicide consisting of cationic polyacrylamide and bipyridyl herbicides (CPAM-BPyHs). CPAM is a positively charged polymer. It can preferentially bind to soil particles and shift their electric potential to a more positive value. Thus, it prevents not only runoff but also inactivation of BPyHs. We also develop a BPyHs-resistant rice line by mutation of the gene encoding L-type amino acid transporter 5 (OsLAT5). Field trial results show that the weed control efficiency of CPAM-diquat for direct-seeded herbicide-resistant rice line exceeds 90%.

Owing to the high level of DNA methylation and unclear regulatory mechanisms, gene engineering to increase spinosad production is challenging. Limited improvements in yield have been observed with heterologous expression or partial overexpression of the 74-kb spinosyn gene cluster (spn), and research on the overexpression of the complete spinosyn gene cluster is lacking. The plasmid pCM265-spn was constructed using CRISPR/Cas9-mediated Transformation-Associated Recombination cloning to enable the overexpression of the complete spn gene cluster in Sa. spinosa. The engineered strain Sa. spinosa-spn achieved a 124% increase in spinosad yield (693 mg/L) compared to the wild type (309 mg/L). The overexpression of the spn gene cluster also delayed spore formation and reduced hyphal compartmentalization by influencing the transcription of related genes (bldD, ssgA, whiA, whiB, and fstZ). Transcriptional analysis revealed significant upregulation of genes in the spn gene cluster, thereby enhancing secondary metabolism. Additionally, optimization of the fermentation medium through response surface methodology further increased spinosad production to 920 mg/L. This study is the first to successfully overexpress the complete spn gene cluster in Sa. spinosa, significantly enhancing spinosad production.

Several mechanisms underlying the protection have been described, but the contributions of nutrient competition versus direct inhibition are controversial. Using an ex vivo model of Salmonella growth in the mouse cecum with its indigenous microbes, we find that nutrient limitation and typical inhibitory factors alone cannot prevent pathogen growth. However, the addition of certain amino acids markedly reverses the microbiota's ability to suppress pathogen growth. Enhanced Salmonella colonization after antibiotic treatment is ablated by exclusion of dietary protein, which requires the presence of the microbiota. Thus, dietary protein and amino acids are important regulators of colonization resistance.",,,gabriel.nunez@umich.edu.

The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy and safety of lurasidone in patients with bipolar depression who present with or without severe anxiety symptoms. Data were pooled from 2 bipolar I depression studies of very similar design that randomized patients, double-blind, to 6 weeks of treatment with lurasidone (20-60 mg/day or 80-120 mg/day) versus placebo. Patients were categorized into 2 groups based on their Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A) score at baseline: a ""severe"" anxiety group (HAM-A ≥ 18) and a ""non-severe"" anxiety group (HAM-A < 18). The primary efficacy measure was the Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS). In the severe anxiety group, significant improvement in the MADRS total score was observed with a moderate effect size (0.41) on lurasidone 20-60 mg, but lurasidone 80-120 mg was not significant (effect size, 0.21); however, in the non-severe anxiety group significant improvement was observed in both lurasidone treatment groups (effect size, 0.51 and 0.54, respectively). Common adverse events were akathisia and nausea, and the change in laboratory parameters and body weight were small and not clinically meaningful. This was a post-hoc analysis of a short-term study.

The resulting hyperinflammation carries several side effects, ranging from autoimmune-like symptoms to cytokine release syndrome (CRS), with potentially severe consequences. Recent findings indicate that ICIs increase the risk of venous and arterial thromboembolic adverse events. Patients with prior VTE might be at higher risk of developing new events under ICI while other risk factors vary across studies. So far, data on CAR T-linked coagulopathies are limited. Hypofibrinogenemia in the presence of CRS is the most commonly observed dysregulation of hemostatic parameters. A rare but particularly severe adverse event is the development of disseminated intravascular coagulation activation, which can occur in the setting of CRS and may be linked to immune effector cell-associated hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis. While the increasing number of studies on thromboembolic complications and coagulation alterations under ICIs and CAR T therapies are concerning, these results might be influenced by the retrospective study design and the heterogeneous patient populations.

In addition to their various other applications, they also hold potential for drug formulation development. Ionic liquids can be used as solubility enhancers, permeability enhancers, stabilizers, targeted delivery inducers, stealth property providers, or bioavailability enhancers. Moreover, ILs hold significant potential in vaccine formulation.

The trial was randomized, double-blind, and placebo-controlled. Ninety-six adolescents were randomly assigned in three groups (high-dose, medium-dose, and low-dose) to receive a dose of the vaccine or the placebo. The patients were monitored for adverse events (AEs) for up to 30 days after each dose of the vaccine and for up to 6 months after all doses of serious AEs (SAEs). All observed AEs and SAEs were reported. Microneutralization assays were used to measure geometric mean titers (GMTs) and seroconversion rates for neutralizing antibodies. IgA and IgG antibodies specific to the rotavirus were detected. The rates of total AEs in these groups were 8.33%, 37.50%, 12.50%, and 4.17%, respectively.

40332747,Amylin: From Mode of Action to Future Clinical Potential in Diabetes and Obesity.,,"Diabetes therapy : research, treatment and education of diabetes and related disorders",10.1007/s13300-025-01733-8,"Precision diabetology is increasingly becoming diabetes phenotype-driven, whereby the specific hormonal imbalances involved are taken into consideration. Concomitantly, body weight-favorable therapeutic approaches are being dictated by the obesity pandemic, which extends to all diabetes subpopulations. Amylin, an anorexic neuroendocrine hormone co-secreted with insulin, is deficient in individuals with diabetes and plays an important role in postprandial glucose homeostasis, with additional potential cardiovascular and neuroprotective functions. Its actions include suppressing glucagon secretion, delaying gastric emptying, increasing energy expenditure and promoting satiety. While amylin holds promise as a therapeutic agent, its translation into clinical practice is hampered by complex receptor biology, the limitations of animal models, its amyloidogenic properties and pharmacokinetic challenges. In individuals with advanced β-cell dysfunction, supplementing insulin therapy with pramlintide, the first and currently only approved injectable short-acting selective analog of amylin, has demonstrated efficacy in enhancing both postprandial and overall glycemic control in both type 2 diabetes (T2D) and type 1 diabetes (T1D) without increasing the risk of hypoglycemia or weight gain. Current research focuses on several key strategies, from enhancing amylin stability by attaching polyethylene glycol or carbohydrate molecules to amylin, to developing oral amylin formulations to improve patients' convenience, as well as developing various combination therapies to enhance weight loss and glucose regulation by targeting multiple receptors in metabolic pathways. The novel synergistically acting glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist combined with the amylin agonist, CagriSema, shows promising results in both glucose regulation and weight management. As such, amylin agonists (combined with other members of the incretin class) could represent the elusive drug candidate to address the multi-hormonal dysregulations of diabetes subtypes and qualify as a precision medicine approach that surpasses the long overdue division into T1DM and T2DM. Further development of amylin-based therapies or delivery systems is crucial to fully unlock the therapeutic potential of this intriguing hormone.Graphical abstract available for this article. Diabetes is a chronic disease with many faces, and persons affected by diabetes are continuously confronted with challenges, with injecting insulin and fighting obesity being the most recent. Current research is focused on designing drug candidates that would simultaneously address different mechanisms of high glucose in an individual and contribute to satiation, body weight control and patient convenience. Amylin is a hormone that is, similar to insulin, secreted by the pancreas. Its clinical use is currently limited to a single product, known as pramlintide, which is approved as an adjunct therapy in persons with insulin-treated diabetes. While the use of amylin is efficient, patients have to inject it with each meal and in a separate injection from insulin. Consequently, improving amylin-based medicines focuses on enabling longer action, resulting in weekly use, possibly even oral use and, most importantly, combining the functions of more than one hormone known for being involved in glucose control and the promotion of satiety. Similarly to other medicines primarily used in persons with diabetes, amylin-based medicines might eventually be used to address different diseases of the metabolic spectrum, namely obesity and its complications.",Muzurović E,Endocrinology Section,dremir@t-com.me.

This retrospective cohort study utilized national data from the National Health Insurance System, linking maternal and infant records with COVID-19 vaccination registries. Newborns with congenital malformations were identified using diagnosis codes. The analysis included women aged 20-49 who gave live births between February 2022 and December 2022. Odds ratios (ORs) for preterm birth and any congenital malformation per COVID-19 vaccination during pregnancy compared to 1:4 matched unvaccinated controls, adjusted for maternal age, residential area, employment, income, disability, month of conception, pre-pregnancy obesity, smoking, and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection prior to pregnancy, were calculated. We compared the risk of two outcomes between BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273. Among 106,692 women who gave birth during the study period, 8,966 (8.4%) received a COVID-19 vaccination during pregnancy. Of the newborns, 7,039 (6.6%) were preterm births and 7,658 (7.2%) had congenital malformations. COVID-19 vaccination during pregnancy was associated with a comparable risk of preterm birth (OR, 1.03; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.77-1.36) and a similar risk of congenital malformations (0.90; 95% CI, 0.72-1.12) compared to non-vaccinees.

Moreover, the development of parasitic resistance against conventional anthelminthic treatment led to the urgent search for new therapeutic strategies, including drug repurposing. Bisphosphonates have been used to inhibit the growth of many parasites and have also emerged as promising candidates for the treatment of cryptosporidiosis and amoebic liver abscess. Alendronate is a second-generation bisphosphonate that is widely used for the treatment and prevention of osteoporosis. Till date, there is not enough data on the effect of this drug on Trichinella spiralis and it is unknown whether the regular use of this drug in osteoporotic patients may alter the course of the infection. ALN showed a significant lethal effect on both adult worms and juveniles, with severe tegumental damage in the form of fissures in the cuticle, widening of the hypodermal gland, and flattening of the cuticular annulation, ending with the appearance of multiple vesicles and large cauliflower masses. Molecular docking outcomes unveiled the potential inhibition of ALN against T. spiralis surface proteins (i.e., Ts-SP, Ts-PPase, Ts-MAPRC2, Ts-TS, Ts-MIF, etc.), with promising results confirmed its ability to defeat T. spiralis via targeting its surface proteins. Moreover, molecular dynamics simulation, through the analysis of RMSD, RMSF, RG, SASA and cluster analysis, proved the prolonged effective inhibition of ALN on T. spiralis inorganic pyrophosphatase, as an essential surface protein required for molting and developmental process of intestinal larval stages.

Emerging evidence suggests that Artemisia argyit essential oil can influence the composition of gut microbes in the host, thereby promoting overall health. However, the specific mechanisms by which Artemisia argyit essential oil modulates gut microbiota to combat S. pullorum infection remains unclear. This study explored the effectiveness of various doses of Artemisia argyit essential oil in preventing S. pullorum infection in chicks. Our findings indicate that consuming this essential oil can mitigate the intestinal mucosal barrier damage and excessive inflammatory response caused by S. pullorum, as well as reverse the weight loss seen in infected chicks. Additionally, chicks that received faecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) from the gut microbiota of Artemisia argyit essential oil donors exhibited notable recovery from S. pullorum infections. This suggests that the observed protection may be linked to the modulation of gut microbiota. Furthermore, 16S rRNA sequencing revealed an increased abundance of Lactobacillus reuteri (L. reuteri), which along with the activation of Wnt/β-catenin pathways, played critical roles in the enhanced health of S. pullorum-infected chicks treated with Artemisia argyit essential oil. In summary, these findings highlight that the dietary inclusion of Artemisia argyit essential oil promotes the intestinal enrichment of L. reuteri, offering a promising strategy for the treatment and prevention of pullorum disease in chicks.",,,dengxm@jlu.edu.cn.

At the same time, the analysis of perfumes with a significant water content can require complex procedures or large amounts of material. These new products are becoming increasingly popular as they reduce skin dryness and irritation, but they require the addition of additives to improve the solubility of all fragrance components. Direct injection into gas chromatography can lead to interferences and requires more frequent maintenance of the chromatographic system, while traditional extraction methods need several steps, a large volume of sample and material, and the use of toxic solvents. In this study, pipette-tip micro-solid-phase extraction (PT-µSPE) was used and optimized as an innovative, simple, sustainable, and time-saving approach. It requires only 10 mg Celite and 10 mg sample while elution is carried out with 100 mg heptane/ethyl acetate (70/30, p/p). The extraction is coupled with GC analysis with simultaneous FID and MS detection (GC-MS/FID), which is used for qualitative, semi-quantitative, and quantitative purposes. The performance of the PT-µSPE method was validated and successfully applied to commercial samples. In addition, the performance of the developed method and of the reference approaches was evaluated, focusing mainly on the overall impact of analysis in accordance with the principles of White Analytical Chemistry. The results show that the PT-µSPE method is more balanced than the conventional methods in terms of analytical performance, greenness, and practical efficiency, making it a valuable alternative for routine use in the fragrance industry.",,,cecilia.cagliero@unito.it.

Marine sponges are a rich source of promising bioactive compounds. Due to their sessile nature and filter-feeding lifestyle, sponges are prone to attack by competitors, predators, and pathogens. To combat these threats, they produce a diverse array of bioactive compounds. Notably, the microbial communities residing within the sponges make many of these beneficial compounds. Twenty-one bacterial isolates from various marine sponges from the Indian coast were selected for this study. The bacterial isolates were fermented to obtain crude extracts, which were then screened against critical bacterial pathogens. Based on the MIC (minimum inhibitory concentration) results, two isolates, Bacillus velezensis NIO_002 and Stutzerimonas stutzeri NIO_003 showing good activity, were characterized by morphological, biochemical, and molecular methods. Genome mining predicted multiple antibiotic biosynthetic gene clusters, most of which showed a high degree of similarity to known gene clusters, and some with low or no similarity which may be indicative of novel gene clusters. LC-MS (liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry) data revealed the putative presence of certain antibacterial compounds previously reported in the literature. To our knowledge, this is the first study to report the antimicrobial activity of marine sponge-associated Bacillus velezensis and Stutzerimonas stutzeri strains characterized by whole genome sequencing, thereby indicating the novelty of our strains.

While glue adhesion on smooth hydrophilic glass is well understood, insect cuticles vary in wettability and wax coatings that resist glue spreading, potentially allowing insects to escape webs. Here, we tested the adhesiveness of viscid silk on the superhydrophobic lotus leaf, an extreme case of a hydrophobic surface, to explore whether hydrophobic cuticles can help insects evade webs. We compared adhesion of viscid silk on three substrates: natural lotus leaves (superhydrophobic due to waxes and microtopography), lotus leaves treated with oxygen plasma (hydrophilic but maintaining microtopography), and smooth hydrophilic glass. We found that viscid silk adheres better to the superhydrophobic lotus leaves than to other surfaces, but that adhesion was always higher on the lotus leaves, regardless of surface energy. These findings demonstrate that viscid silk is resilient to a wide range of surface hydrophobicity and leverages microtopography to increase adhesion, both of which are vital for generalist predators like orb-weaving spiders and may inspire the development of tunable adhesives with multifunctional applications in biomedical, industrial, and robotic fields.",,,

In this regard, nanosponge [NS] offers a novel solution with its three-dimensional porous networks, enhancing drug solubility, bioavailability, and providing prolonged release. The aim of this study was to develop NS fortified with Ciclopirox olamine [CPO] with enhanced drug solubility, prolonged targeted delivery, and improved therapeutic efficacy for the management of fungal skin infections. CPO-loaded ethyl cellulose and polyvinyl alcohol NS were synthesized using the emulsion solvent technique and subsequently evaluated for particle size, surface morphology through scanning electron microscopy [SEM], polydispersity index [PDI], zeta potential [ZP], entrapment efficiency [EE %], drug loading [DL %], drug-excipient interactions via differential scanning calorimetry, and in vitro dissolution studies. Furthermore, the antifungal test was conducted to assess the inhibitory effect on fungal growth. The optimized formulation using ethyl cellulose and polyvinyl alcohol at 1.75 mg and 2 mg, respectively, emerged as the most effective, with a particle size of 526.1 nm and PDI of 0.332, indicating a uniform distribution. Moreover, the formulation demonstrated a high drug loading efficiency and sustained drug release over a 7 h period, achieving a drug release of 77.83 %. The pH of the gel formulations ranged from 5.35 to 7.40, the viscosity ranged from 3759 to 4710 cps, and the spreadability was adequate for topical application. Additionally, the optimized NS exhibited superior antifungal activity against Candida albicans and Aspergillus Niger, compared to drug alone and commercial fungicidal creams. Moreover, the in vitro studies confirmed the gel's effectiveness and its ability to sustain drug release, following Higuchi kinetics. The formulated CPO-loaded NS gels exhibit enhanced solubility, stability, and sustained drug release, significantly improving topical drug delivery with exceptional therapeutic efficacy. This novel approach underscores the potential of NSs for efficient and targeted medication delivery in both the pharmaceutical and cosmetic industries. Furthermore, their effective preparation method, excellent physicochemical properties, and antifungal activity make NSs a promising strategy for the oral delivery of poorly soluble drugs. The fungal skin infections are generally not serious but can be uncomfortable and persistent. With proper hygiene and appropriate treatment, most infections can be effectively managed. Therefore, understanding the types of fungi involved and recognizing symptoms early with an effective delivery system can lead to quicker recovery and reoccurrences.

We therefore document the development of the no/lo market in Great Britain between 2011 and 2022 and examine which stakeholders have been involved in development and what actions they have taken. Narrative timelines created through a documentary review of trade magazines (2011-2022) and market intelligence reports (2015-2022), focusing on product launches, marketing activity, industry changes, retailer actions, governmental actions and third sector activity. A mainstream no/lo market emerged and established from 2015, with activity thereafter characterised by intensive market entry, expansion, and consolidation among both independent producers and mainstream alcohol brands. While initial development concentrated on beers, innovation has since proliferated across the cider, spirits, wine and ready-to-drink categories. Development appears predominately driven by market forces (e.g., product launches and marketing), with January a focal point of activity. Government has not introduced any legislation around no/lo drinks, although it has consulted on appropriate no/lo descriptors (in 2018) and committed (in 2019) to work with industry to grow the no/lo market.

Human GBM tumorspheres (TS) are essential for preclinical drug screening and establishing patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models, but their derivation is often limited to fresh tissue. Whether TS from cryopreserved tissues retain comparable molecular and biological properties to those from fresh tissues remains underexplored. We hypothesized that TS from cryopreserved tissues could provide a reliable alternative for TS derivation, thereby expanding accessibility for GBM research. TS isolation rates were compared across 39 primary GBM samples. Tumor tissues collected during surgical resection were divided into two groups: one processed immediately as fresh tissue, and the other cryopreserved for 1 month before processing. Gene expression profiling via RNA sequencing and biological comparisons, including cell proliferation, neuroglial differentiation, stemness, invasiveness, and responsiveness to radiation and temozolomide, were performed on three matched TS samples from each group. Tumorigenesis was also assessed using PDX models. TS were successfully isolated from 64.1% of fresh and 58.9% of cryopreserved tissues. Gene expression profiling revealed similar expression patterns in TS derived from both tissue types, despite variations in cancer subtypes. Cell proliferation, neuroglial differentiation, stemness, or invasiveness rates did not differ significantly between TS derived from fresh and cryopreserved tissues. All three GBM TS exhibited comparable responsiveness to temozolomide and radiation, as well as similar tumorigenic potential in the PDX models.

In this study, a novel M23 peptidase from Streptococcus thermophilus NCTC10353, designated StM23, was discovered and characterized. It exhibited antibacterial activity against Listeria monocytogenes and other Gram-positive bacteria with meso-DAP-type peptidoglycan, including Bacillus subtilis and Bacillus cereus. To enhance StM23's efficacy and specificity, a chimeric enzyme, StM23_CWT, was engineered by fusing its catalytic domain with a cell wall-targeting domain (CWT) from SpM23B, a peptidoglycan hydrolase found in Staphylococcus pettenkoferi. The engineered chimera demonstrated expanded specificity, showing activity against Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecium. Its ability to disrupt L. monocytogenes cells was visualized by electron microscopy. The enzyme effectively disrupted biofilm structures and decontaminated surfaces like glass, stainless steel, and silicone, showcasing its industrial potential. Safety evaluations using zebrafish, moth larvae, and human cell models confirmed its non-toxic profile, supporting its broad applicability. Based on these findings, StM23_CWT is a novel and potent antimicrobial agent with significant potential to reduce the risk of listeriosis and control persistent pathogens.",,,mdrobek@imdik.pan.pl.

Oat hay and oat pellets were divided into 5 groups: CON (without additives, control), CAP (with 5% calcium propionate), CUR (with 5% curcumin), SKU (with 5% Scutellaria baicalensis) and KC (with 2% potassium carbonate). The nutrients and mould counts of each group were determined after air drying, drying at 50 °C and drying at 50 °C with forced air for 48 h and 96 h, respectively. Compared with air drying, drying at 50 °C and drying at 50 °C with forced air significantly increased the dry matter content of oat. Under different drying times and methods, the addition of preservatives at air-drying for 96 h was more effective at improving the crude protein content of oat hay but was not positive for oat pellets. In addition, under different drying times and methods, the addition of preservatives to oat hay dried at 50 °C for 48 h was more effective at reducing the contents of neutral detergent fibres and acidic detergent fibres. The addition of CUR to oat pellets dried at 50 °C was the most effective at reducing the neutral and acidic detergent fibres of oat pellets. Under different drying times and methods, the addition of preservatives during air drying and drying at 50 °C for 48 h was more effective in reducing mould counts in oat hay and oat pellets. In addition, CUR resulted in higher CP contents and lower mould counts not only in oat hay dried at 50 °C for 48 h but also in oat pellets air dried for 48 h, which indicates its potential use in oat hay production.",Lu S,Tongliao agriculture and animal husbandry development centre,zyufen71099@163.com.

However, despite its promising bioactive properties, there is a lack of comprehensive toxicological data on its safety, especially regarding its potential medical use. Previous studies have primarily focused on its industrial applications, with limited investigation into its biological effects. This gap in knowledge prompted the current study, which aimed to investigate the subacute toxicity of colemanite in rats using behavioral, hematological, biochemical, genotoxic, and histopathological analyses. Over a 7-day period, rats were treated with doses of 10, 30, and 300 mg/kg. Behavioral assessments, including locomotor activity and elevated plus maze tests, indicated enhanced exploratory behaviors, indicating heightened curiosity or activity and no alterations in motor coordination or anxiety-like behaviors. Hematological findings revealed dose-dependent reductions in hematocrit, hemoglobin, and red blood cell counts, while biochemical analyses showed elevated aspartate aminotransferase, lactate dehydrogenase, and cholesterol levels at higher doses, suggesting hepatotoxicity and lipid metabolism disruption. Genotoxicity analysis demonstrated increased micronucleus formation at 30 and 300 mg/kg, indicative of chromosomal instability possibly linked to oxidative stress. Histopathological evaluations revealed mild hepatocyte degeneration and hyperemia in the liver and brain tissues at the highest dose. Importantly, no significant toxic effects were observed at the 10 mg/kg dose. These findings highlight the dose-dependent toxicity of colemanite, with low doses exhibiting a favorable safety profile. This study underscores the need for dose optimization and further research to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying colemanite's toxicological effects, including its impact on various organs over both short-term and long-term exposures. Additionally, future studies should focus on assessing the human relevance of these effects to ensure its safe and effective therapeutic application.",,,ozlem.ozdemir@erzurum.edu.tr.

Due to the high metastatic potential of TNBC and the limitations of current therapies, selective and potent ST6GAL1 inhibitors are urgently needed. In this study, a scaffold-hopping approach from lithocholic acid to bishomolithocholic acid successfully led to the discovery of novel ST6GAL1 inhibitors, SPP-037 and HZF01, with enhanced biological activity and selectivity. Both compounds significantly inhibited MDA-MB-231 cell migration, HUVEC tube formation, tumor growth, and metastasis in vitro and in vivo. Molecular docking studies revealed key interactions between the ST inhibitors and ST6GAL1, supporting their enhanced selectivity and binding affinity. Additionally, SPP-037 and HZF01 were found to block integrin α2,6-sialylation, disrupting integrin activation and downstream signaling pathways involving the phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and paxillin, which are critical for cell migration.

Data analysis from the top 20 highly industrialised and the top 20 least industrialised nations revealed that industrial activities significantly contribute to global warming, with temperature increases of up to 2 °C observed in highly industrialised regions. These environmental changes influence the distribution and evolution of AMR genes, as rising temperatures can affect bacterial resistance in a manner similar to antibiotics. Through a bioinformatics approach, a marked disparity in AMR gene frequencies was observed between highly industrialised and less industrialised nations, with developed countries reporting higher frequencies due to extensive antibiotic use and advanced monitoring systems. 'Eco-AMR Zones' is proposed as a solution to specialised areas by promoting sustainable industrial practices, enforcing pollution controls, and regulating antibiotic use to mitigate AMR's environmental and public health impacts. These zones, supported by collaboration across various sectors, offer a promising approach to preserving antibiotic effectiveness and reducing environmental degradation. The study emphasises the importance of integrated global strategies that address both the ecological and public health challenges posed by AMR, advocating for sustainable practices, international collaboration, and ongoing research to combat the evolving threats of climate change and antimicrobial resistance.",,,alao.jude@autuni.ac.nz.

However, PFASs have been increasingly associated with health concerns, including reproductive toxicity, endocrine disruption, and thyroid disease. In 2023, the US consumer platform ""Mamavation"" reported organic fluorine levels ranging from 105 to 20,700 ppm in 18 contact lenses, raising concerns about the potential presence of PFASs in these products. Given the absence of established international testing methods and regulatory limits for PFASs in contact lenses, this study evaluated nine standard international methods, ultimately selecting 49 PFASs as target analytes after eliminating overlaps. To facilitate detection, novel extraction methods were developed for contact lenses and their lens care solutions. Ultraperformance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) was employed for analysis, utilizing an analytical column (Atlantis Premier BEH C18 AX, 1.7 µm, 2.1 × 100 mm) and an isolator column (Atlantis Premier BEH C18 AX, 5 µm, 2.1 × 50 mm) to minimize background interference. Electrospray ionization in combination with multiple reaction monitoring mode enabled rapid analysis within 24 minutes. For contact lenses, the limit of quantification (LOQ) ranged from 1 to 400 ng/g, while for lens care solutions, the LOQ ranged from 0.04 to 0.8 ng/mL. When applied to 12 contact lens samples, the method detected 6:2 FTS (1H,1H,2H,2H-perfluorooctane sulfonic acid) in only one lens care solution at a concentration of 0.087 ng/mL.

One way to accelerate the development of pro-cognitive therapies for schizophrenia is to evaluate compounds using biomarker approaches tailored to relevant neural mechanisms. While D1/D5 receptor (D1R/D5R) agonism has been extensively studied in neuroscience, its therapeutic potential for cognitive impairment in schizophrenia remains untapped. The Translational Neuroscience & Computational Evaluation of a D1R Partial Agonist for Schizophrenia (TRANSCENDS) clinical trial tests this mechanism using a 'target engagement' approach. Multiple, double-blind doses of a D1/D5R partial agonist were administered in advance of a functional neuroimaging (fMRI) session that deployed a cognitive paradigm explicitly designed to capture a translational micro-circuit mechanism underlying spatial working memory in patients with schizophrenia. Specifically, this study will assess whether the D1R/D5R partial agonist CVL-562 induces a dose-dependent engagement of spatial working memory circuits in schizophrenia using fMRI. This design, and the use of spatial working memory neural circuits as a dependent measure, was selected on the basis of a translational and computational understanding of prefrontal micro-circuitry and a mechanistic understanding of the role of D1R/D5Rs in schizophrenia. To enhance data integration and scalability, TRANSCENDS employs an automated informatics framework for seamless neuroimaging data sharing and electronic clinical data capture. This ensures high-standards for regulatory compliance, data quality, and data sharing across sites, improving aspects of current clinical trial data management.

Nanomedicine and nanobiotechnology,10.1002/wnan.70014,"The cosmetic industry has developed and commercialized numerous products using new technologies, making them increasingly appealing to the public. The use of metallic nanoparticles (MtNPs) as key ingredients in cosmetics has become more widespread due to their demonstrated benefits. However, the use of these products remains controversial, as some studies have shown that MtNPs can penetrate the deeper layers of the skin and disrupt homeostatic balance. It has also been demonstrated that the interaction between MtNPs and keratinocytes increases the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which can lead to oxidative stress, a condition associated with premature aging. Mitochondria, as the main organelles responsible for energy production, also provide and maintain the regulatory mechanisms necessary for keratinocytes to sustain a strong protective barrier against environmental threats including MtNPs. To date, the relationship between redox imbalance, premature aging, and the central role of mitochondria remains under investigation due to the fact that mitochondrial metabolism, linked to increased oxidative stress, is associated with the development of various defense mechanisms, including antioxidant enzymes. In this review, we focus on the role of oxidative stress generated in mitochondria and the function of antioxidant enzymes in detoxifying metal ions from MtNPs contained in cosmetics. We examine their effects on keratinocytes and the potential for premature aging.",,,

However, most existing nutrition databases are Western-centric, lacking comprehensive dietary information for non-Western populations, including Koreans. This limitation hinders the accuracy of in silico gut microbiome analyses and microbiome-disease associations. We developed the Korean Nutrition Model (KNM) to enhance in silico microbiome analyses by incorporating detailed macronutrient and micronutrient compositions reflective of Korean dietary patterns. KNM was constructed using a decision algorithm that integrates data from the Ministry of Food and Drug Safety and FooDB. Comparative analysis with the European Nutrition Model revealed significant differences in carbohydrate and vitamin compositions, which in turn influenced microbial growth rates and metabolic fluxes in in silico simulations. We further evaluated gut microbiota differences between Korean and European cohorts, including healthy individuals and inflammatory bowel disease patients. Our findings demonstrate that using an appropriate, population-specific nutrition model significantly improves microbiome analyses, reducing the risk of false associations.

Studies using this secretome often utilise material collected from short term and sub-confluent lab-scale cultures. Secretome was derived from prolonged culture of high-density industrial scale human Wharton's jelly stem cells and its effects on wound healing was assessed. In vitro cell proliferation and scratch closure assays showed that secretome treatment dose-dependently increased cell proliferation and promoted scratch closure. Subsequently, using biopsy punch, circular wounds were created on three-dimensional de-epidermised dermis human skin equivalent (in vitro) where secretome-treated wounds showed accelerated wound closure, and enhanced epithelial proliferation and differentiation were observed and quantified. In an in vivo rat acute wound model, secretome applied to the back of test animals greatly enhanced wound healing by promoting re-epithelialisation, vascularisation and granulation maturation. In conclusion, secretome derived from prolonged culture of high-density industrial scale two-dimensional human Wharton's jelly stem cells possesses potent wound healing properties.

If successfully qualified, a COA can be relied upon to measure a COI that has an application in drug development and regulatory decision-making. Thus, qualified COAs are important DDTs. This analysis aims to assess the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA's) performance reviewing applications in the COA Qualification Program, as well as the uptake of qualified COAs in drug development to date. In order to assess the use of qualified COAs in drug development, we analyzed the Summary Basis of Approvals (SBA) retrieved from Drugs@FDA and the COA compendium. The submission and review dates for the Letter of Intent (LOI), Qualification Plan (QP), and Full Qualification Package (FQP) steps were retrieved from Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) & Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research's (CBER) database, as well as the FDA COA Qualification Program website. Our analysis showed that 86 COAs were listed on the FDA COA website, with a majority of them being Patient Reported Outcomes (PRO). Completeness Assessment (CA) for each portion of submission, as well as review times for the LOI, QP, and FQP steps vary widely, with 46.7% of submissions having a review time exceeding the published targets. To date, 7 COAs (8.1%) have achieved qualification, and one (1.1%) has been denied after undergoing all steps for qualification. On average, it takes 6 years for a COA to be qualified. Our analysis of FDA's approval documents shows that the Agency has relied on qualified COAs to support benefit-risk assessment of 11 medicines. Only three of the seven qualified COAs have been used to support benefit-risk assessment of medicines. The three qualified COAs that have been used are KCCQ, E-RS, and EXACT. Each of these has been used to support multiple indication claims. KCCQ - cardiomyopathy for 2 medicines, heart failure for 6 medicines; E-RS - chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) for 1 medicine; and EXACT - COPD for 3 medicines. Note: E-RS and EXACT were both used in aclidinium bromide/formoterol/fumarate. In each case they were used as secondary or exploratory endpoints, none as primary endpoints. Only 1 qualified COA was included in drug labels. The lengthy and unpredictable nature of the COA Qualification Program review timelines poses a risk for tool developers and sponsors intending to qualify a new COA, to use an existing COA or sponsors intending to qualify and use a new COA in the drug development process. Our findings show that, to date, the DDT Qualification Program has not significantly improved the inclusion of qualified COAs in clinical development plans to support regulatory decision-making and label claims, and therefore the impact of the pathway to facilitate the use of innovative tools has been limited. To improve the utility of this program, FDA should publicly share the timelines so participants can be better prepared to integrate into their development programs. Furthermore, FDA should clearly articulate how and when COAs can be used in drug development.",Yang F; Bousnina I; Madej A; Kalamegham R,Genentech,kalamegham.rasika@gene.com.

In China, significant amounts of elemental sulfur are sprayed annually on rubber plantations to support crop performance. To investigate the effects of sulfur spraying on microbial diversity, composition, interactions, and functionalities in rubber plantation soil, soil samples from rubber plantations in Yunnan, South China, were collected, and bacterial and fungal communities were analyzed through high-throughput sequencing. Results showed that sulfur application did not alter the alpha diversity but the beta diversity of the soil bacterial community. Notably, sulfur disturbed the relative abundances of Chloroflexi and Planctomycetes. Certain bacteria (e.g., Bacillus and Sinomonas) thrived under sulfur treatment, influencing nutrient cycling. The ecological network analysis revealed enhanced bacterial and fungal interconnections. Sulfur application had a limited impact on microbial phenotypes and community functions, yet it inhibited sulfur compound respiration. These findings indicate that sulfur spraying can shift microbial community composition and influence nutrient cycling by favoring specific microbial groups. Despite its limited impact on microbial phenotypes, sulfur affects key metabolic processes, such as sulfur respiration, which are vital for soil health and microbial activity. The results highlight the need for sustainable sulfur management to optimize nutrient cycling and soil health on rubber plantations.",Wan S,Hainan Province Nanfan Management Bureau,wangmeng@hainanu.edu.cn.

Existing research suggests that ligands for the α2δ subunit of voltage-gated calcium channels may carry a risk of abuse. To evaluate the abuse potential of crisugabalin, five well-recognized animal models were utilized in these preclinical studies. Firstly, an intravenous self-administration paradigm was implemented in rats that were self-administering propofol to assess the reinforcing effects of crisugabalin. Secondly, a rat drug discrimination study was employed to determine the pharmacological similarity between crisugabalin and the training drug midazolam. Then, a conditioned place preference (CPP) paradigm in rats was utilized to evaluate the rewarding properties of crisugabalin. After that, a spontaneous withdrawal study was conducted in rats chronically treated with crisugabalin to examine the liability of developing physical dependence. Finally, a mouse pentylenetetrazol-induced convulsion model was used following chronic exposure to crisugabalin to assess its potential for physical dependence. The results indicated that crisugabalin showed no positive reinforcing effects and did not display midazolam-like discriminative stimulus effects. Moreover, crisugabalin did not induce significant CPP in rats and there was no risk of physical dependence in the pentylenetetrazol-induced convulsion model. In the rat spontaneous withdrawal study, crisugabalin demonstrated a very low level of physical dependence. These findings suggest that crisugabalin has minimal to no potential for abuse, thereby establishing itself as a safer option relative to pregabalin and mirogabalin.",Gou X; Liu Y; Ye Q; Chen Y; Dong Y; Meng Q; Shi Z; Li Y; Lu Y; Wang J,Haisco Pharmaceutical Group Co.; Hangzhou Chuanhe Lingjing Technology Co.; Saifu Laboratories Co.,wangju@haisco.com.

Given the recognized anti-tumor and immunomodulatory impacts of IFNα, the development of novel strategies to harness these attributes while minimizing associated toxicity could provide significant benefit for patients. The concept of attenuating IFNα binding affinity for its receptor was conceived to address this challenge and led to the development of CD38-targeted Attenukine™, a CD38-targeted antibody attenuated IFNα immunocytokine. In this study, we sought to delineate the effects of targeting AttenukineTM specifically to tumor cells and/or immune cells using an antibody to CD38, a cell surface glycoprotein expressed on certain tumor and immune cells, using different mouse models and anti-human or anti-mouse CD38-targeted Attenukine™. Our results demonstrate that an anti-human CD38 AttenukineTM inhibits tumor growth through direct anti-proliferative effects of IFNα on CD38 + tumor cells as well as by indirectly modulating the anti-tumor immune response. In various in vivo models leveraging syngeneic mice bearing tumors with or without CD38 expression, administration of CD38-murine AttenukineTM mediated anti-tumor efficacy with increased immune activation and intra-tumoral infiltration. These data point to a potential dual mechanism of action for CD38-targeted Attenukine™, involving both tumor- and immune-directed effects, and highlight the potential benefit of a CD38-targeted attenuated IFNα therapy to deliver the known effects of IFNαtreatment to a broad spectrum of patients, while limiting the toxicity typically associated with recombinant IFNα.",Bi M; Pogue S; Björck P,Discovery R and D,

We investigated the association between caffeine consumption, psychological distress, and sleep difficulties in a genetically informative cohort of individuals with a history of depression. Survey data and genetic information were sourced from the Australian Genetics of Depression Study (AGDS [ The highest consumers of caffeine reported higher psychological distress measured by the Kessler 10 scale (β = 1.21, SE = 0.25,  Higher rates of caffeine consumption were associated with higher levels of psychological distress, but not insomnia, in individuals with a history of depression. While the direction of causality is unclear, caffeine consumption may be a modifiable factor to reduce distress in individuals susceptible to mental health problems. Some of the previous findings of common variant associations with caffeine consumption and susceptibility were replicated. Caffeine is the world’s most popular and available mind-altering drug, commonly found in coffee. Typical caffeine use is generally safe, but caffeine can also cause anxiety and insomnia when consumed in large amounts, or by especially susceptible people. Several genetic variants have been found to change how people react to caffeine. Our study sought to investigate the nature of these relationships. We used data from the Australian Genetics of Depression Study (AGDS), where ∼12,000 people with a history of depression were surveyed about their mental health and behaviours like caffeine consumption. A total of ∼9,000 AGDS participants provided information on genetic variants of interest. We used linear modelling to see how caffeine consumption correlated with psychological distress, sleep quality, substance use, and genetic variants. People who drank high amounts of caffeine each day were more distressed but did not differ in their sleep. Those who said that caffeine interferes with their sleep drank less caffeine. Participants carrying particular genetic variants tended to have more caffeinated drinks each day, or be more susceptible to caffeine. Our survey data only contain one slice of time, so we cannot say whether caffeine causes distress or whether people use caffeine to alleviate symptoms caused by unrelated distress. Our data do not measure precise dosage, or account for tolerance built over time. These results indicate that changing one’s caffeine consumption could help reduce distress in people experiencing depression or similar illnesses.",,,

Here, we identified the tumor cell-expressed paired immunoglobulin-like type 2 receptor alpha (PILRα) as an immune suppressor targeting T cells using high-throughput screening. PILRα inhibits T cell activation, proliferation and effector function by targeting CD99, a T cell surface antigen, suppressing ZAP70/NFAT/IL-2/JAK/STAT signaling. A cluster of O-glycosylated serine and threonine residues within the stalk region is critical for PILRα-CD99 interactions. Blocking these interactions with a stalk-targeting anti-PILRα antibody enhances T cell antitumor immunity and suppresses tumor growth. When combined with programmed cell death protein 1 antibody, anti-PILRα antibody shows synergistic tumor suppression. Notably, PILRα is highly expressed in several human cancers and predicts poor prognosis.

The imbalance between excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmissions may be implicated in the mechanism of action of ketamine. This study aimed to evaluate whether the ratio of glutamate and glutamine (Glx) to GABA levels at baseline in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) could predict ketamine response in patients with TRD. This exploratory study analyzed data from a double-blind randomized clinical trial with an open-label extension study (jRCTs031210124). Fifteen participants in the ketamine group and 15 of 16 participants in the placebo group received repeated intravenous ketamine during the double-blind and open-label extension periods, respectively. We measured Glx and GABA levels in the dACC before and after treatment during the double-blind period using proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS-17) was measured for depressive symptomatology. General linear models were used to examine the relationship between baseline Glx/GABA ratio and HDRS-17 score changes. Changes in HDRS-17 scores (mean (±SD)) following ketamine treatment were -4.9 (6.5) and -4.9 (5.2) in the double-blind and open-label periods, respectively. A higher baseline dACC Glx/GABA ratio was correlated with greater improvement in HDRS-17 (β = -0.42, p = 0.040). In the ketamine group, a reduction in the dACC Glx/GABA ratio was correlated with greater HDRS-17 improvement (β = 0.74, p = 0.009) with no such association in the placebo group.

This study investigated the effects of inulin supplementation on systemic health and its underlying mechanisms by integrating the microbiota and metabolome analyses. One hundred twenty 16-day-old male Cherry Valley ducks with similar initial body weight (BW) were randomly assigned to 20 cages, with two treatments (6 ducks/cage and 10 cages/treatment): a basal diet (CON group) or a basal diet supplemented with 25 g inulin/kg (INU group). The 18-d feeding trials demonstrated that ducks fed the inulin-supplemented diet presented significantly improved growth performance, bone health, and meat quality compared with those in the control group (P < 0.05). Additionally, inulin supplementation reshaped the intestinal microbiota, increasing diversity and the abundance of Alistipes, Ligilactobacillus, and Streptococcus (P < 0.05). Metabolome analysis revealed that inulin feeding significantly modulated 13 metabolites (P < 0.05), which were enriched primarily in health-related metabolic pathways such as taurine and hypotaurine metabolism, steroid hormone biosynthesis, and histidine metabolism. Correlation analysis revealed a positive relationship among the modulated microbes and metabolites and improved healthy parameters.

Tolerable concentrations of the compounds were established in vivo. Whilst no toxicity was recorded following treatment with Alpha tocopherol and Orotic acid, the remaining compounds displayed marked toxicity. We then conducted cell viability experiments in primary human fibroblast cell lines, and observed that tolerable concentrations in larvae produced 50-100% cell viability in vitro.

In the UK, domestic laundering machines (DLMs) are commonly used to clean healthcare worker uniforms, raising concerns about their effectiveness in microbial decontamination and role in AMR development. This study aimed to evaluate DLMs' ability to decontaminate microorganisms and their potential impact on AMR. The performance of six DLMs was assessed using Enterococcus faecium bioindicators under various wash cycles and detergent conditions. Shotgun metagenomics was used to analyse the microbiome and resistome of DLMs. The minimum inhibitory concentrations of domestic detergents were determined for Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and detergent tolerance and antibiotic cross-resistance were assessed. Results showed only 50% (3/6) of DLMs achieved sufficient decontamination (≥5 log10 CFU reduction) at 60°C during full-length cycles, with rapid cycles performing inconsistently. Microbiome analysis revealed the presence of potentially pathogenic bacteria (e.g., Mycobacterium sp.

Detergent tolerance assays showed increased bacterial tolerance to detergents, with cross-resistance to antibiotics observed in S. aureus and K. pneumoniae, including carbapenem and β-lactam groups. Whole genome sequencing identified mutations in genes encoding efflux pumps in S. aureus (MrgA) and K. pneumoniae (AcrB) after detergent exposure, which could impact efflux pump function. Findings suggest domestic laundering of healthcare uniforms may be insufficient for decontamination, posing risks for HAI transmission and AMR.

40305357,HPMA Copolymers: A Versatile Platform for Targeted Peptide Drug Delivery.,2025-04-30,Biomolecules,10.3390/biom15040596,"Peptide drugs have been broadly applied in cancer treatment and diagnosis due to their ability to accurately identify biomarkers with good biocompatibility. However, their clinical application is limited by protease degradation, which induces short circulation half-life, low bioavailability, and high renal clearance. In recent years, delivery systems based on nanomaterial technology have become an important strategy to break through the bottleneck of peptide drug delivery. Among them, N-(2-hydroxypropyl) methacrylamide (HPMA) copolymers have attracted much attention due to their good biocompatibility, hydrophilicity, and low immunogenicity. The high molecular weight of HPMA copolymer-peptide can circumvent renal clearance, significantly prolong the circulation time in the body, and achieve drug accumulation and microenvironment-triggered release synergistically with EPR effects and active targeting. This review introduces the basic properties of HPMA copolymers, including solubility, biocompatibility, and tunable chemical structure. The important applications of HPMA copolymer-peptide in tumor diagnosis and treatment are discussed. This review deepens our understanding of the future development of HPMA copolymers and will provide more references for improving peptides by simple copolymers.",,,

Fibroblast activation by transforming growth factor β1 (TGFβ1) and disrupted metabolic pathways, including the arginine-polyamine pathway, play crucial roles in IPF development. Polyamines are agonists of the calcium/cation-sensing receptor (CaSR), activation of which is detrimental for asthma and pulmonary hypertension, but its role in IPF is unknown. To address this question, we evaluated polyamine abundance using metabolomic analysis of IPF patient saliva. Furthermore, we examined CaSR functional expression in human lung fibroblasts (HLFs), assessed the anti-fibrotic effects of a CaSR antagonist, NPS2143, in TGFβ1-activated normal and IPF HLFs by RNA sequencing and immunofluorescence imaging, respectively; and NPS2143 effects on polyamine synthesis in HLFs by immunoassays. Our results demonstrate that polyamine metabolites are increased in IPF patient saliva. Polyamines activate fibroblast CaSR in vitro, elevating intracellular calcium concentration. CaSR inhibition reduced TGFβ1-induced polyamine and pro-fibrotic factor expression in normal and IPF HLFs. TGFβ1 directly stimulated polyamine release by HLFs, an effect that was blocked by NPS2143. This suggests that TGFβ1 promotes CaSR activation through increased polyamine expression, driving a pro-fibrotic response. By halting some polyamine-induced pro-fibrotic changes, CaSR antagonists exhibit disease-modifying potential in IPF onset and development.",Ecker R,TissueGnostics,

However, conventional preservatives (e.g., formaldehyde) pose environmental and health risks due to their toxicity. In this study, we isolated Aspergillus amstelodami from the surface of Oreochromis mossambicus specimens and evaluated the antifungal potential of 1,2-benzoisothiazolin-3-one and Kathon. Both agents exhibited strong inhibitory effects on fungal growth, as evidenced by clear inhibition zones. Transcriptomic analysis revealed: (1) upregulation of detoxification-related genes, including cytochrome P450-mediated xenobiotic/drug metabolism, ABC transporters, and two-component systems, and (2) downregulation of ribosome biogenesis genes, impairing protein synthesis in Aspergillus amstelodami.

Sugarcane is an important global food and industrial crop, but numerous pathogens threaten its productivity. Our team recently identified the fungus Nigrospora oryzae as a pathogen affecting sugarcane's growth and productivity. Although silicon supplementation is active against most fungi, it remains unclear if it would enhance the resilience of sugarcane to N. oryzae, and molecular mechanisms underlying this process are yet to be explored. In this study, we explored the effects of four silicon concentrations (control, 1 mM, 2 mM, and 4 mM) on the growth and disease resistance of seedlings of the sugarcane variety ROC22 under fungal stress. Employing an integrative approach combining detailed phenotypic analysis with transcriptomic and metabolomic profiling, we elucidated the underlying molecular mechanisms of silicon's protective effects. Results indicated that optimal concentrations (2 mM) of silicon enhanced disease resistance and significantly improved plant height, root characteristics, and enzymatic activities. Transcriptomic analysis revealed an upregulation of genes (826) involved in pathogen recognition and defensive response, while metabolomic analysis highlighted alterations in metabolic pathways pertinent to stress response. These findings suggest that silicon supplementation could effectively bolster sugarcane's defense against fungal diseases, offering new insights into its role in plant pathology and paving the way for developing more resilient crop varieties.",,,phcemail@126.com.

Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) are key drivers of lung cancer metastasis and drug resistance. M2-polarized TAMs dominate the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) and promote EMT through cytokines such as TGF-β, IL-6, and CCL2. Conversely, EMT-transformed tumor cells reinforce TAM recruitment and M2 polarization through immunomodulatory factors such as CCL2 and ZEB1, thereby establishing a bidirectional interplay that fuels tumor progression. Current evidence on this interaction remains fragmented, and a comprehensive review of the TAM-EMT regulatory network and its therapeutic implications is lacking. This review systematically integrates the bidirectional regulatory mechanisms between TAMs and EMT, highlighting their roles in lung cancer progression. It also summarizes emerging therapeutic strategies targeting TAM polarization and the EMT process, emphasizing their potential for clinical translation. This study fills the gap in systematic reviews on the interaction between TAMs and EMT, providing a comprehensive theoretical foundation for future research and the development of novel lung cancer therapies.",,,

A major challenge is the need to enrol participants at multiple sites across different jurisdictions. Regardless of whether the trials involve children, adults, or both, CTs need to meet separate Competent Authority (CA) requirements to proceed in each participating country. This work, undertaken by the Working Group (WG) on International Collaborations at the European Network of Pediatric Research at the European Medicines Agency (Enpr-EMA) aims to describe the regulatory requirements including any specific to pediatrics, as well as current or upcoming changes across six jurisdictions-the European Union (EU), United Kingdom (UK), United States of America (USA), Canada, Japan, and Australia. An open questionnaire developed by the WG and directed at both the CA and the national pediatric clinical trial networks arranged by jurisdictions. A synopsis of the current legislative and regulatory requirements for CTs applications, application submission processes and application requirements is presented for each of the six jurisdictions. Requirements were found to be mostly consistent across jurisdictions. No difference was found in processes for CTs submission, review, and authorization for pediatric CTs vs. CTs in adults. However, there are additional Ethics Committee/Institutional Review Board requirements for clinical trials including children. Some jurisdictions are considering adopting a risk-based approach, inspired by the Organization of Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) recommendations on Governance.

Pseudomonas putida, a soil bacterium, is known to degrade hydrocarbons and xenobiotics, and possesses numerous genes associated with heavy metal tolerance. Most studies on metal tolerance in P. putida focus solely on over- or underexpressed genes, potentially overlooking important genes with unchanged expression. This study employed a Tn-seq approach to identify the essential genes required for P. putida growth under metal stress. This method enables the identification of mutants with altered fitness in the presence of excess metals. The screen successfully identified a number of known genes implicated in metal resistance, including czcA-1, cadA-3, cadR, and pcoA2, thereby validating the approach. Further analyses using targeted mutagenesis and complementation assays revealed PP_5337 as a putative transcriptional regulator involved in copper tolerance and the two-component system RoxSR (PP_0887/PP_0888) as a key determinant of cadmium tolerance. Additionally, PP_1663 and PP_5002 were identified as contributing to cadmium and cobalt tolerance, respectively.

We fabricated an LPM electrode loaded with the RAPA-PLGA drug-sustained-release system and carried out in vitro and in vivo experiments to verify its effect. A scanning electron microscope showed that the LPM electrode cavity was loaded with the RAPA-PLGA drug's sustained-release system. The energy-dispersive spectrometer showed that the LPM electrode had RAPA and PLGA-related elements. The average drug loading rate of the drug sustained-release system was (51.02% ± 2.66) %, and the encapsulation rate was (85.04% ± 4.43%). The RAPA loaded in the electrode chamber was about (337.83 ± 53.66)μg. In vitro release results show that the LPM electrode loaded with RAPA-PLGA can continue to release for 44 days. In vitro cell inhibition experiments showed that the drug-loaded electrode group had an obvious inhibitory effect on fibroblasts, and the difference between the groups was significant (p < 0.05). In vivo experiments showed that the local bioelectrical impedance of the drug-loaded electrode group is lower than that of the control group, with a difference between groups with statistical significance (p < 0.05). The histopathological analysis of tissue sections from the site of (LPM electrode implantation revealed reduced fibrous tissue hyperplasia in the drug-loaded electrode group compared to the control group. Additionally, H&E staining indicated that the implantation of drug-loaded electrodes did not induce abnormal alterations in the liver, heart, spleen, lung, or kidney tissues. The LPM electrode loaded with RAPA-PLGA demonstrates significant, sustained drug release and anti-proliferative effects in vitro.

Evaluating the feasibility of the use of antidiabetic drugs for treating cerebrovascular diseases is meaningful in this field. We designed a comprehensive study process that includes two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR), which uses genetic proxies for antidiabetic drug targets, summary-based MR (SMR) for mRNAs, and colocalization for drug target genes to assess their causal relationships with 10 cerebrovascular disease phenotypes. Seven of the eight main types of clinical antidiabetic drugs were identified, yielding eleven potential drug targets.

This leads to substantial economic losses and underscores the urgent need for new treatments and infection controls. However, the lack of a simple, sensitive infection model has hindered studies on the pathogenicity of A. hydrophila and therapeutic evaluation. This study introduces the silkworm (Bombyx mori) as a highly sensitive and cost-effective infection model for A. hydrophila. Using a strain isolated from diseased Wakins (goldfish), the pathogenicity of A. hydrophila was confirmed in silkworms, which exhibited a much lower median lethal dose (LD₅₀ = 0.3 CFU/larva) compared to Wakins (LD₅₀ = 5.1 × 10⁶ CFU/g body weight). This demonstrates the silkworm's higher sensitivity to A. hydrophila. The in vivo efficacy of three antibiotics (gentamicin, kanamycin, and tetracycline) was also tested. Gentamicin and kanamycin prolonged survival in both models, while tetracycline also showed efficacy in both models, though its effect was weaker in the silkworm model. This highlights the silkworm model's utility in evaluating bactericidal agents against A. hydrophila. This model addresses key limitations of traditional fish infection models, including low sensitivity, long experimental durations, and high costs. The silkworm-based method enables efficient investigation of A. hydrophila pathogenicity and rapid screening of potential treatments, accelerating the development of new therapeutic strategies for aquaculture and beyond.",,,

Salicylic acid (SA) is a plant hormone involved in the regulation of potato (Solanum tuberosum) resistance to Phytophthora infestans. In this study, it was found that exogenous methyl salicylate (MeSA) treatment could significantly enhance the resistance of potato to P. infestans. RNA-seq results confirmed that SA was important for potato resistance to P. infestans. Salicylic acid binding protein 2 (SABP2) is a member of α/β hydrolase family, which can convert MeSA into SA to regulate the steady state of SA in plants. StSABP2 protein was obtained through prokaryotic expression, and enzymatic analysis in vitro confirmed that StSABP2 could transform MeSA into SA. In order to explore the function of StSABP2 in the process of plant resistance to P. infestans, we carried out virus-mediated gene silencing of StSABP2 in potato and transiently expressed StSABP2 in tobacco. The results showed that StSABP2 positively regulated plant resistance to P. infestans, and this process was achieved by mediating the transcription of SA signal and defence-related genes. Then we screened for the upstream regulator of StSABP2. The results of double luciferase and yeast one-hybrid analysis showed that StNAC2 could activate the transcription of StSABP2. The StNAC2-StSABP2 module regulated potato resistance to P. infestans by positively mediating the SA pathway.

However, growing efforts in developing ADCs with higher complexity in a faster timeline impose a great challenge to their analytical support. Herein, for the ADC carries an antibody and linker-payload with distinct UV/vis absorption maxima, we propose a high-throughput and multiattribute ADC analysis strategy based on size exclusion chromatography coupled with UV detection (SEC-UV). Briefly, in addition to the quantitation of aggregates and fragments, SEC excludes FDRI from ADC-related peaks and improves the accuracy of DAR determination via dual-wavelength UV detection. Relative FDRI content can be determined subsequently by comparing the free-drug-related and ADC-related peaks at a wavelength where UV absorbance is exclusively attributed to the linker-payload. Afterward, a quantitative consistency in DAR and FDRI analysis was established between SEC-UV and orthogonal methodologies widely adopted by the pharmaceutical industry. The applicability of the developed SEC-UV method was further extended through feasiblity studies on ADC process-intermediates, bispecific ADC, and photodegraded ADC. Despite lacking characterization of drug load distribution and profiling of individual FDRI species, its efficiency, simplicity, and high throughput make SEC-UV a phase-appropriate strategy for supporting in-process monitoring and early-stage process development of diverse ADC projects.",Song W; Yin L; Ren J; Jiang L; Huang ZA; Fan Y; Tao R; Duan T; Su Z; Cao Y; Song J; Xu A,Department of Global Technical Operations (GTO),

Using a representative karst depression in Guangxi as a case study, we measured soil concentrations of arsenic (As), cadmium (Cd), lead (Pb), and zinc (Zn). These concentrations were analyzed in relation to soil physicochemical properties, morphology, and geological factors to understand pollution dynamics and migration patterns. The findings highlight As as the dominant contaminant, primarily existing in a highly mobile, reduced form. Further analysis shows that its mobility is strongly influenced by soil pH and available phosphorus (AP), emphasizing the interplay between soil chemistry and pollutant behavior. The study area, dominated by limestone strata, experiences changes in soil oxidative conditions due to rainfall, which significantly influence As accumulation and migration. The presence of abundant iron and manganese oxides further amplifies these effects. According to the Hakanson index, As contamination in surface soils presents a high ecological risk to the surrounding environment. Microbial analysis reveals a positive correlation between Proteobacteria and both the total concentration and chemical forms of As. These bacteria demonstrate resistance to As and contribute to increased residual As content, thereby reducing its toxicity and mobility.

Nonetheless, narrow spectral ranges and the necessity for specialized equipment often limit traditional methods such as optical rotatory dispersion and electronic circular dichroism. Here, we introduce Mueller matrix polarimetry (MMP) as a more versatile tool for chiroptical analysis, capable of simultaneously capturing circular dichroism and optical rotatory dispersion spectra across ultraviolet to near-infrared wavelengths in a single measurement. We applied MMP to chiral metal complexes of Al, Mn, and Co, commonly used as catalysts in asymmetric syntheses. Using a robust experimental methodology, MMP distinguished enantiomeric forms and provided reliable chiroptical information by leveraging the inherent relationship between circular dichroism and optical rotatory dispersion. We interpreted our findings on the basis of density functional theory simulations, compared them to traditional electronic circular dichroism and absorption spectroscopies, and performed the Kramers-Kronig analysis. The combined approach of chiroptical MMP and ab-initio, for example, reveals delicate near-infrared chiroptical spectra of a neutral cobalt metal complex. Although MMP is more commonly used for solid state, the developed experimental protocol significantly expands its capabilities to solutions.

The plant's surface is densely populated with trichomes, which are believed to be the primary sites for the biosynthesis and accumulation of patchouli essential oil. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the development of these trichomes in P. cablin remain largely unexplored. This study employed transcriptomic sequencing to identify and characterize genes co-regulated in trichome development and essential oil biosynthesis in P. cablin. Notably, we report the first identification of PcHD8, a member of the HD-ZIP gene family. Homologous genes, such as AaHD8 in Artemisia annua and SlHD8 in Solanum lycopersicum, have been shown to promote both trichome formation and secondary metabolite synthesis. We cloned PcHD8 and overexpressed it in Nicotiana tabacum, which resulted in a significant increase in trichome density compared to the control. Conversely, silencing PcHD8 via virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) in P. cablin led to a marked reduction in trichome density. GC-MS analysis revealed a significant decline in the key biomarkers of patchouli essential oil, patchouli alcohol and pogostone, following PcHD8 silencing. These findings establish PcHD8 as a key positive regulator of trichome development and essential oil biosynthesis.

Methotrexate (MTX) is the most widely prescribed drug for RA treatment; however, its efficacy is often limited, with resistance frequently observed. Fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS) play a pivotal role in RA progression and are closely linked to drug resistance, although the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. In this study, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of public single-cell transcriptomics data from osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis synovial tissues, identifying RNF19A as a gene potentially associated with RA resistance in FLS. Our findings indicate that RNF19A is significantly overexpressed in drug-resistant FLS and is closely associated with the dysregulation of FLS proliferation, migration, invasion, and apoptosis. Furthermore, we demonstrated that RNF19A promotes functional disruption in FLS by ubiquitinating and degrading MKP-1, thereby activating the MAPK signaling pathway. This activation also facilitates the nuclear translocation of ZBTB20, an upstream transcription factor of RNF19A, which further enhances RNF19A transcription. This biological process creates a positive feedback loop in FLS, contributing to RA resistance-a mechanism that was also validated in vivo. In summary, this study is the first to underscore the crucial role of RNF19A in mediating drug resistance in RA FLS, elucidating the underlying biological processes, and providing novel insights into RA pathogenesis, thereby offering a new experimental foundation for RA drug development.",,,dzy0215@live.cn.

The key mechanism of action of itaconate was initially found to be the competitive inhibition of succinate dehydrogenase (SDH), which inhibits the production of inflammatory factors, as well as its antioxidant effects. With increasing research, it was discovered that it modifies cysteine residues of related proteins through the Michael addition, such as modifying the Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (KEAP1) protein and activating the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF2) signalling pathway, as well as glycolytic enzymes and cellular pathway-associated factors that attenuate inflammatory responses and oxidative stress. It also acts on a variety of immune cells, affecting their function and activity, and has been increasingly shown to play a therapeutic role in a variety of inflammatory and autoimmune diseases through a combination of these mechanisms. In conclusion, there has been a great breakthrough in the research of itaconate, from the initial industrial application to the redefinition of the biological functions of itaconate. However, with the deepening of the research, we also found that there are more questions: the mechanism of action of itaconate, more functions of itaconate, clinical application of itaconate, and the use of itaconate still needs to be solved.",,,
40289412,National Granted Programs and Public Funds for Biopharmaceutical Startups in Japan.,2025-04-28,Pharmacology research & perspectives,10.1002/prp2.70106,"In Japan, biopharmaceutical startups have not been sufficiently nurtured, leading to weak international competitiveness in new drug development. This is partly due to low levels of entrepreneurship in the private sector and limited investment in startups. Therefore, it is crucial for the Japanese government to provide financial support for biopharmaceutical startups. This study aims to offer a comprehensive overview of the current state of government grants and investments for biopharmaceutical startups in Japan, as well as to discuss the associated challenges and future directions. Both grant programs specifically focused on drug discovery and development and those supporting a broader range of industries, including drug discovery and development, were identified through literature reviews and web searches. Advisory programs affiliated with government agencies that assist biopharmaceutical startups were also identified. Additionally, the government has established national university funds at four universities, which have made investments in biopharmaceutical startups. While the government offers various grant programs to support biopharmaceutical startups at different stages of research and development, the relatively small scale of these grants and limited support for seed-stage projects pose significant challenges. Consulting services provided by the government, which offer advice on drug development strategies and processes, have been particularly beneficial for university researchers in Japan who lack expertise in drug discovery and development. However, some initiatives spread across different ministries, highlighting the need for a more unified national approach.",,,

Ponkan.,2025-04-28,World journal of microbiology & biotechnology,10.1007/s11274-025-04367-x,"Cuminaldehyde demonstrates strong antimicrobial properties against several disease-causing organisms. This study investigated its antifungal effectiveness against an imazalil-resistant strain of Penicillium italicum, the pathogen responsible for postharvest blue mold disease in citrus fruits. Cuminaldehyde significantly inhibited the mycelial growth of P. italicum, with both the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum fungicidal concentration (MFC) estimated at 0.5 mL/L. In vivo assays revealed that treatment with 4 × MFC cuminaldehyde in Tween-80 significantly reduced blue mold incidence in Ponkan mandarins inoculated with P. italicum. After 6 days of incubation, the disease incidence in fruits treated with 4 × MFC cuminaldehyde was approximately 72%, compared to 80% in the Prochloraz-treated fruits and 100% in the control group. The antifungal activity was attributed to the activation of oxidative stress, as evidenced by the accumulation of reactive oxygen species, damage to plasma membrane permeability in hyphal cells, and leakage of intracellular components. Additionally, treatment with 4 × MFC cuminaldehyde preserved the quality of the inoculated Ponkan mandarins by day 6. Overall, these findings indicate that cuminaldehyde is a potent antifungal alternative to current chemical fungicides used for controlling postharvest blue mold disease in Ponkan mandarins.",,,nengguotao@126.com.

To investigate the absorption and metabolism regulation of salvianolic acid B and tanshinone IIA combination (Comb1) along with fraction of salvianolic acids and tanshinones combination (Comb2) in DKD rats. Plasma concentrations of 11 salvianolic acids and tanshinone compounds of Comb2 were determined using ultra-performance liquid chromatography in rats with DKD. The Caco-2 cell monolayer model was used to study the transmembrane transport of salvianolic acids and tanshinones and compatibility of the two compounds. Finally, we assessed the effects of cytochrome P450 (CYP450) enzyme on the metabolism of salvianolic acids and tanshinones as well as the compatibility of their components in normal and DKD rats using in vitro incubation of liver microsomes. The results showed that danshensu, protocatechualdehyde, dihydrotanshinone I, cryptotanshinone, tanshinone I, and tanshinone IIA were well-absorbed in vivo. Salvianolic acid B and salvianolic acids promoted the absorption of tanshinone IIA, whereas tanshinones promoted the absorption of danshensu and inhibited the absorption of protocatechualdehyde. In vitro incubation of liver microsomes showed that salvianolic acids may not undergo phase I metabolism. The pathological status of DKD affected the metabolic rates of tanshinones not the content of total CYP450 enzymes. The molecular compatibility of salvianolic acid B and tanshinone IIA as well as of salvianolic acids and tanshinones act synergistically to improve DKD by affecting drug absorption and metabolism.

Due to the widely application of Dimethyl sulfate (DMS), it is necessary to study its potential toxicity. According to ecological data analysis, DMS has been identified as a potential environmental hazard, particularly in water bodies. However, its toxicity to aquatic organisms remains largely unexplored. In this study, using zebrafish embryos as a model system, we evaluated the toxicity of DMS for the first time and uncovered significant adverse effects on early embryonic development, characterized by extensive cardiac damage and neurotoxicity. DMS inhibited the activity of antioxidant enzymes, resulting in excessive production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and subsequent apoptosis of myocardial cells, along with pericardial edema, bradycardia, and elongated SV-BA distance. Additionally, DMS directly induced oxidative stress and altered the activity of acetylcholinesterase (ACHE) and adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase), thereby disrupting the expression of genes involved in neural development and neurotransmission. These findings may contribute to the DMS-induced behavioral abnormalities, such as reduced and unbalanced locomotion in larvae and altered swimming behavior. Importantly, astaxanthin, an antioxidant carotenoid, was able to rescue the embryonic cardiac and neurotoxic effects triggered by DMS exposure, suggesting that DMS primarily induces zebrafish cardiac and neural developmental toxicity through upregulation of oxidative stress. Overall, our study demonstrates the potential of DMS to induce cardiac and neurotoxicity in zebrafish embryos, suggesting toxicity risks to other aquatic organisms and even humans. These findings provide a basis for a comprehensive assessment of DMS toxicity and serve as an early warning for its environmental presence and product residues.",,,zigangcao@126.com.

Factors affecting the specificity of lignin self-assembly for industrial applications.",,Advances in colloid and interface science,10.1016/j.cis.2025.103521,"This review considers a profoundly underutilized resource, technical lignin, and its potential for large scale upgrading for higher-valued industrial usage by means of self-assembly processes. Molecular interactions that can be used to guide lignin self-assembly are systematically explored, categorizing them into physicochemical interaction-driven assembly and external stimuli or template-driven assembly. Published findings are examined to reveal molecular mechanisms governing lignin aggregation into lignin nanoparticles (LNPs), films, and interfacial behavior in Pickering emulsions that have potential to be used industrially. Recent advancements in experimental techniques are explored to provide deeper insights into lignin's self-assembly processes. Hydrophobic effects, π-π stacking, hydrogen bonding, electrostatic layering, polyelectrolyte complex formation, chain entanglement, and covalent cross-linking are critically assessed as potential means to control the self-assembly of lignin and systems involving lignin. Additionally, external factors, such as chemical dehydration, solvent-mediated interactions, and external fields are examined related to their role in templating lignin assembly. Based on a comprehensive review of the literature, hydrophobic interactions are predominant in lignin aggregation, with hydrophobicity degrees varying significantly across lignin samples. Interfacial rheology studies demonstrate that lignosulfonate exhibits maximum storage moduli at oil-water interfaces, significantly enhancing emulsion stability. Additionally, modified lignins via esterification contribute larger lifetimes of water-in-oil emulsions stability under varying salinity and oil types. The integration of molecular modeling with experimental characterization techniques can further optimize lignin-based materials for multiple applications, such as drug delivery, catalysis, advanced pesticide delivery systems, bioplastics, 3D printing, and emulsification, among many others. Although there are existing technical and economic assessments (TEA) and life cycle assessments (LCA) involving lignin self-assembly that point to promising prospects, there is a need for more comprehensive TEA and LCA work to clear the way for the needed industrial innovations in this field.",Trovagunta R; Suarez A; Zambrano F,Solenis LLC; WestRock Company,hubbe@ncsu.edu.

The second step was to investigate the effect of levamisole as a feed supplement for tilapia fish on growth performance, immunity, serum biochemistry, and the protective effect against artificial infection with the previously isolated in the first step P. aeruginosa strain. One hundred samples were collected from morbid Nile tilapia fish in the first step. The incidence of P. aeruginosa was 14%. Susceptibility of P. aeruginosa isolates to 9 antimicrobial agents showed that about half of P. aeruginosa isolates were multidrug-resistant (MDR) to (5-6) antibiotics. All of the isolates were sensitive to amikacin, ciprofloxacin, and norfloxacin (100%), and half of them were resistant to azithromycin, amoxicillin with clavulanic, tetracycline, and sulfa with trimethoprim.

Due to the high mutability of the PEDV genome, the development of effective vaccines or drugs to prevent and control PEDV is still facing great difficulties. In this study, we found that the natural compound curcumin showed effective antiviral activity against PEDV in VERO-E6 and IPEC-J2 cells. The Janus Kinase-Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription (JAK-STAT) signaling pathway was screened by transcriptomics as a potential innate immune mechanism of IPEC-J2 cells against PEDV infection. For PEDV, a highly pathogenic virus, cellular autoimmune response is not sufficient to fight against its infection. Our results demonstrated that curcumin could exert antiviral effects by enhancing the JAK-STAT cascade reaction mediated by type I interferon IFN-α and IFN-β in IPEC-J2 cells. In vivo experiments further confirmed the protective effect of curcumin on PEDV-infected piglets and its positive regulation of the JAK-STAT signaling pathway. In vivo, curcumin prophylaxis significantly enhanced IFN-α and IFN-β-induced JAK-STAT signaling and the production of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs), and increased the innate immune response, thus exerting antiviral effects effectively.

Beyond conventional prodrug strategies, this study introduces a novel nanoconversion technology that chemically modifies DTX to form self-assembled nanoparticles (NPs), which subsequently convert into a paclitaxel-mimicking molecule (PTXm, 3). Hydrophilic acetylated Phe-Arg-Arg-Phe peptide ((Ac)FRRF, 4) and hydrophobic docetaxel were conjugated to prepare self-assembled (Ac)FRRF-DTX NPs. The selective cleavage of the Arg-Phe bond by cathepsin B, which is abundant in cancer cells, facilitated the nanoconversion of PTXm (3) from (Ac)FRRF-DTX NPs, demonstrating effective cytotoxic effects. Utilizing the cleavage site of peptide and specific sequences (ex. Arg-Arg-Phe), this approach does not simply act as a prodrug but allows the nanomaterial to transform into another cytotoxic biomolecule within tumors. (Ac)FRRF-DTX NPs exhibited remarkable physicochemical properties, superior anti-cancer efficacy, and low toxicity, showcasing an innovative conversion in peptide-conjugated nanomedicine. Unlike traditional prodrug chemistry, this tumor-specific nanoconversion process involves the biochemical transformation of DTX (1) into PTXm (3) via enzymatic action.

Cold atmospheric plasma (CAP) offers a tumor-selective ablation strategy but suffers from limited tissue penetration. To overcome this, the FlexiPlasma microcatheter (FPM) is developed, integrating flexible non-metallic microtubes and ring-shaped electrodes for precise CAP delivery to deep tumors. The optimized FPM-generated CAP eliminates cytotoxic UV and ozone while inducing tumor-specific pyroptosis via a ROS/Caspase-8/GSDMC pathway. Gasdermin-C (GSDMC) is highly expressed in liver tumors but absent in normal tissues, ensuring selective targeting with minimal inflammation. FPM is combined with embolic material (EM), PPP@CD hydrogel, enhancing injectability, tumor embolization, and sustained drug release. This FPM-EM strategy potentiates antitumor immunity, particularly CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell responses. These findings establish FPM-EM as a safe, effective, and minimally invasive therapy for HCC, revealing a non-inflammatory pyroptosis mechanism and broadening the potential of CAP-based cancer treatments. The FPM-EM combination offers promising new therapeutic options for HCC, addressing the limitations of TACE. Furthermore, the FPM-EM platform can be extended to the interventional therapy of other tumors and adapted to incorporate various drugs and nano-/micro-materials, highlighting the strong potential for future clinical translation.",,,

The ototoxic effects of antiretroviral therapy (ART) and comorbid conditions like tuberculosis (TB) further compound the risk. This narrative review examines the intersection of HIV/AIDS, ART, and occupational noise-induced hearing loss (ONIHL), emphasizing the South African and broader African contexts. The aim of the study was to map the existing literature on the association between HIV/AIDS, its treatments, and ONIHL, and to identify research gaps to inform policy and clinical practice. A narrative review approach was adopted, systematically searching databases including PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science. Studies published between 2000 and 2024 were included, focusing on the effects of HIV/AIDS, ART, and occupational noise exposure on hearing health. Data extraction and thematic synthesis were performed to identify key findings and gaps. Twenty studies were included, covering diverse settings such as South Africa, Cameroon, Tanzania, and the USA. Three key themes emerged: (1) dual burden of HIV and occupational noise exposure: HIV-positive individuals in noise-intensive industries, such as mining, face amplified risks of hearing loss due to immunological compromise and ototoxic TB treatments; (2) ototoxicity of ART: older ART regimens, widely used in resource-limited settings, are associated with a higher prevalence of sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL); and (3) immunological susceptibility to ONIHL: HIV-related immune suppression exacerbates cochlear damage from noise and ototoxic agents, contributing to both peripheral and central auditory dysfunction. This review highlights the urgent need for integrated hearing health interventions in HIV care and occupational health frameworks, particularly in high-prevalence regions like South Africa. Routine audiological assessments, access to safer ART regimens, and enhanced workplace protections are essential to mitigate the dual burden of HIV/AIDS and ONIHL.

While immortalized cell lines have long been employed to investigate intestinal cell functions and host-pathogen interactions in sheep, they inadequately mimic the physiological characteristics of ovine intestinal inflammation and may lose critical genetic features. The emergence of organoids has revolutionized in vitro intestinal inflammation modeling by offering superior structural and functional fidelity to native tissues. In this study, we developed an IL-1β-induced intestinal inflammation organoid model derived from East Friesian sheep ileal crypts. Our data demonstrate that treatment with 30 ng/mL IL-1β significantly increased inflammatory factor secretion, the apoptosis of intermediate cells, and disrupted barrier integrity while simultaneously reducing bud formation capacity, organoid area, and stem cell proliferation. RNA-seq analysis revealed that IL-1β activated the NF-κB/TNF/IL-17 signaling pathway in intestinal organoids, thereby orchestrating the inflammatory response. This study establishes a novel sheep-derived intestinal inflammation organoid model, providing a physiologically relevant platform to investigate intestinal inflammation pathogenesis. These findings offer a translational tool for advancing drug development and pharmacological mechanism exploration in ovine intestinal inflammation research.",,,

The objective of this research is to investigate the effect of C-terminal deletion of the ATF6B gene on membrane protein production in HEK293T cells using CRISPR-Cas9 technology. To identify effective gene targets, sgRNAs were initially designed against multiple UPR-related genes, including ATF6A, IRE1A, IRE1B, PERK, and ATF6B. Among them, ATF6B was selected as the primary target for further investigation due to its superior editing efficiency. The efficiency of sgRNAs was evaluated using the T7E1 assay, and sequencing was performed to verify gene editing patterns. Membrane proteins were extracted from both ATF6B C-terminally deleted (ATF6B-ΔC) and wild-type (WT) cell lines for comparison. Flow cytometry was employed to assess membrane protein production by analyzing GFP expression in Membrane-GFP-expressing cells.

The intracellular HBV pregenomic RNA copy number relative to total RNA was measured by RT-PCR, and various protein expressions associated with oxidative stress were analyzed by a Western blot analysis. The results showed that the Nrf2, HO-1, Akt, and Bcl-xL proteins were decreased by the continuous infection, indicating that HBV-positive cells were exposed to oxidative stress. The present study evaluated the anti-HBV infection effects of the Nrf2 activator fucoxanthin (Fx), a marine carotenoid from edible biological resources, including the comparative natural Nrf2 activator pteryxin (Ptx). These Nrf2 activators suppressed the HBV pregenomic RNA production in the HBV-infected cells, thus increasing the expression of the proteins of Nrf2 and HO-1. In the persistently infected cells transfected with the HBV genome, the Bcl-xL and Keap1 proteins, which contribute to suppressing the HBx protein involved in the HBV replication, were overexpressed.

40277551,New Frontiers for the Early Diagnosis of Cancer: Screening miRNAs Through the Lateral Flow Assay Method.,2025-04-25,Biosensors,10.3390/bios15040238,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs), which circulate in the serum and plasma, play a role in several biological processes, and their levels in body fluids are associated with the pathogenesis of various diseases, including different types of cancer. For this reason, miRNAs are considered promising candidates as biomarkers for diagnostic purposes, enabling the early detection of pathological onset and monitoring drug responses during therapy. However, current methods for miRNA quantification, such as northern blotting, isothermal amplification, RT-PCR, microarrays, and next-generation sequencing, are limited by their reliance on centralized laboratories, high costs, and the need for specialized personnel. Consequently, the development of sensitive, simple, and one-step analytical techniques for miRNA detection is highly desirable, particularly given the importance of early diagnosis and prompt treatment in cases of cancer. Lateral flow assays (LFAs) are among the most attractive point-of-care (POC) devices for healthcare applications. These systems allow for the rapid and straightforward detection of analytes using low-cost setups that are accessible to a wide audience. This review focuses on LFA-based methods for detecting and quantifying miRNAs associated with the diagnosis of various cancers, with particular emphasis on sensitivity enhancements achieved through the application of different labels and detection systems. Early, non-invasive detection of these diseases through the quantification of tailored biomarkers can significantly reduce mortality, improve survival rates, and lower treatment costs.",,,

The targeted delivery approach promisingly helps to surmount the unmet clinical needs of conventional therapies, including chemoresistance, limited penetration, and side effects. In the case of melanoma, various receptors were overexpressed on the tumor site, among which folate receptor (FR) targeting is considered to be a progressive approach for managing melanoma. FRs are the macromolecules of the glycosyl phosphatidylinositol-attached protein that possess globular assembly with a greater affinity toward specific ligands. So, the functional ligands can be utilized to design targeted nanocarriers (NCs) that can effectively bind to overexpressed FRs. Hence, folate-adorned NCs (FNCs) offer various benefits such as site-specific targeting, cargo protection, and minimizing toxicity. This review focuses on the insights and implications of FRs, targeting FRs, and mechanisms, challenges, and advantages of FNCs. Further, the applications of various FNCs, such as liposomes, polymeric NCs, albumin nanoparticles, inorganic NCs, liquid crystalline nanoparticles, and nanogels, have been elaborated for melanoma therapy. Likewise, the potential of FNCs in immunotherapy, photodynamic therapy, chemotherapy, gene therapy, photothermal therapy, and tumor imaging has been exhaustively discussed. Furthermore, translational hurdles and potential solutions are discussed in detail. The present review is expected to give thoughtful ideas to researchers, industry stakeholders, and formulation scientists for the efficacious development of FNCs.",,,

Formononetin (FMN), a natural non-steroidal isoflavonoid, has been confirmed to exhibit remarkable anti-inflammatory efficacy, but the impact of FMN on depression and the underlying antidepressant mechanisms are still not fully understood. This study aimed to investigate whether the antidepressant effect of FMN is involved in modulating microglia polarization, and if so, what are the underlying mechanisms. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced depressive mice were used to study antidepressant mechanisms of FMN. Microglia cell line BV2 stimulated by LPS was employed to investigate pharmacological mechanisms of FMN. Effects of FMN on neuronal damage were detected by H&E, Nissl and Golgi staining. The efficacy of FMN were evaluated by immunostaining and western blots in vivo and vitro. In addition, molecular docking, luciferase reporter assay, cellular thermal shift assay (CETSA) and drug affinity responsive target stability (DARTS) were used to confirm the direct target of FMN. Our results showed that FMN significantly reverses depression-like behaviors, alleviates neuroinflammation and neuronal damage, rebalances M1/M2 polarization, inhibits NLRP3 inflammasome and enhances microglial autophagy level in prefrontal cortex of LPS-induced depressive mice. In vitro assays, results unraveled that autophagy inhibitor chloroquine (CQ) blocks effects of FMN on inhibiting NLRP3 inflammasome and rebalancing M1/M2 polarization. Moreover, PPARα is identified as a direct target of FMN and FMN can activate PPARα-mediated autophagy. Furtherly, combination PPARα agonist (WY14643) with FMN had no significant additive effects on inhibiting NLRP3 inflammasome and rebalancing M1/M2 polarization, whereas PPARα antagonist (GW6471) abrogated these pharmacologic effects of FMN in BV2. Importantly, GW6471 exhibited similar pharmacologic effects to abolish antidepressant effect of FMN in LPS-induced depressive mice. Our study firstly demonstrated that FMN can rebalance microglia M1/M2 polarization and inhibit NLRP3 inflammasome, with the involvement of activating PPARα-mediated autophagy to ameliorate depression-like behaviors, which provides a novel view to elucidate antidepressant mechanisms of FMN and also offers a potential therapeutic target for depression.",,,Supan@hactcm.edu.cn.

It is an effective means to reduce fertilizer usage and protect the environment, and plays an important role in agricultural production. However, under drought stress, traditional foliar fertilizers are susceptible to photolysis and evaporation loss, which affects the efficiency of nutrient absorption. This experiment used the 10-year-old grape 'Zitian Seedless' planted in the Wuwei area of the Hexi Corridor as the test material, focusing on foliar fertilizer adjuvants, and through its synergistic effect, explored the effects of potassium dihydrogen phosphate combined with different foliar fertilizer adjuvants on leaf endogenous hormones and fruit quality. This experiment had a total of six treatments: CK (potassium dihydrogen phosphate), T1 (potassium dihydrogen phosphate + ethylated and methylated vegetable oil), T2 (potassium dihydrogen phosphate + silicone), T3 (potassium dihydrogen phosphate + green citrus oil), T4 (potassium dihydrogen phosphate + sodium nitrophenolate aqueous solution), T5 (potassium dihydrogen phosphate + triacontanol solution + benzylaminopurine). The effects of different foliar fertilizer adjuvants on grape fruit quality and endogenous hormones in leaves were explored through a solar greenhouse experiment. Different foliar fertilizer adjuvants can improve the quality of fresh grapes, and each treatment significantly increased the content of soluble solids in the fruit. T4 (potassium dihydrogen phosphate + sodium nitrophenolate) had the best effect: the single fruit weight, Vc, tannin and anthocyanin content of the mature fruit increased by 52.55%, 64.68%, 24.97%, and 152.56% respectively compared with CK, and the organic acid content decreased significantly. At the same time, the total content of aroma substances reached 1188.90 µg·kg⁻¹, which was 86.25% higher than that of CK. The analysis of endogenous hormones in leaves showed that T4 treatment had the most significant effect on ZT at the inflorescence separation stage, and the most significant effect on SA, IAA and ABA at the expansion stage, which were 121.89%, 15.62%, 137.23% and 37.36% higher than those of CK at the same period. In addition, T4 treatment had the lowest drug cost and was more economical. This study revealed the effects of different foliar fertilizer adjuvants on the fruit quality and endogenous hormones of 'Zitian Seedless' grapes. It provides an efficient and low-cost foliar fertilizer adjuvant application scheme for grape cultivation in the Hexi Corridor region, which has important practical significance for improving the economic benefits and sustainable development of the fresh grape industry.",,,bhch@gsau.edu.cn.

While Streptococcus mutans (S. mutans) is a keystone species in dental caries, its process for rapid biofilm expansion remains unclear. Using an air-solid interface model simulating the oral environment, we uncovered a novel expansion for S. mutans biofilms. Our findings reveal that S. mutans employs a distinct two-step expansion strategy. Through osmotic pressure, extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) spread and transport bacterial clusters to new sites. Subsequently, the hydroxyapatite surface enables new colony formation. Hydroxyapatite's acid-neutralization properties appear critical for bacterial growth and colonization. Despite successful EPS spreading, environments without hydroxyapatite failed to support new colony formation. These results reveal the unique pattern of rapid ECC progression in sugar-rich environments and establish EPS as a promising therapeutic target, advancing understanding of cariogenic biofilm behavior and preventative strategies for ECC prevention.",,,jkwon@yuhs.ac.

However, emergence of antibiotic resistance has become a global challenge, one that has resulted in multi-national calls for policy to improve antibiotic use. One such call has been to restrict the use of antibiotics deemed critically important for human health, such as colistin, during the production of food producing animals. Between 2016 and 2019 numerous countries, including India, implemented policies to heavily restricted the use of colistin in livestock. While this represents a key shift in the antibiotic policy landscape, other classes of critically important antibiotics continue to be used during food production. This paper provides a policy analysis of India's 2019 colistin ban to provide insight into how this came to be and to identify factors which could shape the development of future legislation. The analysis revealed that while antibiotic reform in food production had been in the background of India's policy agenda for some time, it took key-focusing events to shift the policy climate into a period of action. These focusing events included reporting of mobile colistin resistance genes in bacteria isolated from pigs in China and colistin resistant bacteria isolated from food samples in India. Consistent narratives had been built around colistin's role as a last resort antibiotic which, together with relatively low proportion of colistin resistance in bacteria isolated from human patients, framed legislation as a worthwhile endeavour for policy makers. In addition, India acted as a global player in antibiotic stewardship and followed the precedent set by several other countries in restricting colistin use during food production. As most colistin for animal use was imported into India from China, and viable alternative animal treatments existed, there was limited industry opposition that could block legislation. We suggest evaluation of these five critical factors (focusing events, consistent narratives, worthwhile endeavour, precedent for change, and industry opposition) should be part of the policy formulation process for legislation regarding the use of other critically important antibiotics in food production.",,,mphennessey@rvc.ac.uk.

It is crucial for the pharmaceutical industry to be clear of the reporting and case management requirements for such issues. The Health Sciences Authority of Singapore used a mixed-methods evaluation strategy, combining an online questionnaire and face-to-face focus group discussions to identify areas for knowledge enhancement and challenges faced by the industry regarding product defect reporting and recall procedures. These findings were used to plan training workshops. A self-administered online survey was emailed to representatives of all pharmaceutical companies with registered medicines and/or vaccines, or cell, tissue and gene therapy products (CTGTPs) in Singapore. The aim was to find out the challenges faced with product defect reporting and recall procedures. Two face-to-face focus group discussions were conducted with selected companies, specifically those that conducted product recalls between September 2022 and August 2024. A two-day online industry training workshop was held in October 2024. Pre- and post-workshop quizzes, including self-rating questions, were conducted to quantify the participants' baseline knowledge and what they gained from the workshop. In total, 136 out of 463 individuals (29.4%) completed the online survey questionnaire for medicines and vaccines, while 24 out of 42 individuals (57.1%) completed the survey for CTGTPs. Seventeen industry professionals were invited for two focus group discussions. Participants provided feedback on existing processes, and requested clearer guidelines and examples on reportable defects, to aid their internal decision-making. The training workshop saw 318 and 271 industry professionals in attendance over two days, respectively, with 160 participating in both pre- and post-workshop quizzes. There was an improvement in average quiz scores ranging from 4.5% to 25.0% post-workshop. Participants' self-ratings also improved from a median of 3 (out of 5) to median of 4 from pre- to post-workshop. The series of evaluations revealed an enhanced understanding of regulatory requirements in industry professionals through a combination of surveys, focus group discussions and tailored training workshops.

However, the effects of catechol on zebrafish redox and behaviour are unknown. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of catechol on oxidative stress levels in early zebrafish development and on behaviour in later stages of zebrafish development and to attempt to intervene in this effect with music therapy. We exposed zebrafish adults and juveniles to catechol separately, tested zebrafish juveniles for various redox indices and found that zebrafish juveniles had increased levels of reactive oxygen species and decreased total antioxidant capacity and lipid peroxidation capacity, and we tested zebrafish adults for behavioural studies and found that anxiety behaviours increased as social cohesion decreased. We then conducted a music therapy intervention for catechol exposure in adult zebrafish and found that music therapy exacerbated catechol-induced behavioural abnormalities and altered oxidative levels, whether zebrafish were exposed to both catechol and classical music or whether the catechol exposure was followed by a 12-day classical music intervention after 12 days of catechol exposure. In summary, this study revealed for the first time that catechol caused redox imbalance in juvenile zebrafish and socially disturbed, anxious behaviour in adults and found that music treatment worsened this behavioural abnormality. This study provides new insights into the effects of catechol on zebrafish and suggests that the therapeutic effects of music therapy may have a double-edged effect.",,,

The recently published READUS-PV guideline, designed to standardize reporting practices of DA-based publications, is a commendable first step toward standardizing DA reporting; however, it will not overcome totally many of the inherent limitations of DA including their inability to eliminate unnecessary noise in order to identify true signals. The limitations arise from the data sources of AEs, the analytic approaches, and the interpretability of the results. This article discusses those limitations, highlights the challenges posed by the premature publication of safety signals derived from spontaneous reports, and evaluates the READUS-PV guideline's potential to improve interpretation of DA results. The article emphasizes that effective reporting of safety signals is only the first step; a broader, coordinated effort is necessary to establish clear scientific boundaries on what aspects of signal detection should be publicly shared to prevent unwarranted alarm and misinterpretation.

Visit-to-visit BPV was quantified using standard deviation (SD), coefficient of variation (CV), and average real variability (ARV) of systolic and diastolic blood pressure measurements. Participants were stratified into three groups based on systolic BPV tertiles. AF cases were identified via follow-up electrocardiograms and reports of AF-related serious adverse events. After excluding individuals with baseline AF or missing BPV data, 7378 patients were analyzed over a median follow-up of 3.8 years. The incidence of new-onset AF increased across ascending tertiles of systolic BPV (CV), with rates of 2.5% (62 cases), 4.1% (104 cases), and 5.2% (127 cases) observed in the lowest to highest tertiles, respectively. After adjusting for age, race, blood pressure, and cardiovascular risk factors, the hazard ratios for AF in the second and third tertiles compared to the lowest tertile were 1.52 (95% CI: 1.10-2.09) and 1.83 (95% CI: 1.34-2.49), respectively. Consistent trends were noted for systolic BPV measured via SD and ARV, as well as diastolic BPV. These findings indicate that elevated visit-to-visit BPV independently predicts AF development in hypertensive populations. Assessing BPV may enhance risk stratification and identify patients at heightened risk for AF, underscoring its clinical relevance in hypertension management.",,,

Cysteine dioxygenase type 1 (CDO1), an iron-dependent thiol dioxygenase enzyme, catalyzes the rate-limiting step for cysteine oxidation, and so that functions as an important regulator of cellular cysteine availability. However, whether inflammatory environment affects CDO1 activity and cysteine oxidation and its potential impact on tumor growth remains substantially elusive. In the present study, we demonstrate that CDO1 activity and cysteine oxidation is inhibited upon IL-6 treatment, without noticeable alterations in CDO1 expression. Mechanistically, AKT1 phosphorylates CDO1 T89 under IL-6 treatment, which represses CDO1 enzymatic activity by disrupting iron incorporation. Further, AKT1-mediated CDO1 T89 phosphorylation is required for IL-6-elicited oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) growth, and is associated with the progression of OSCC development. The present data discover a new mechanism by which AKT1-mediated CDO1 T89 phosphorylation governs cysteine oxidation to support OSCC growth, thereby highlighting its value as a potential anti-tumor target.",,,huangxiaoke_2006@163.com.
40269479,Peptide-Based Strategies in PLGA-Enhanced Tumor Therapy.,2025-04-24,Journal of peptide science : an official publication of the European Peptide Society,10.1002/psc.70020,"Peptide-based therapeutics have gained attention in cancer treatment because of their good specificity, low toxicity, and ability to modulate immune responses. However, challenges such as enzymatic degradation and poor bioavailability limit their clinical application. Peptide-functionalized poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) systems have emerged as a transformative platform in cancer therapy that offers unique advantages, including enhanced stability, sustained release, and precise delivery of therapeutic agents. This review highlights the synergistic integration of peptides with PLGA and addresses key challenges of peptide-based therapeutics. The application of peptide-functionalized PLGA systems encompasses a diverse range of strategies for cancer therapy. In chemotherapy, peptides disrupt critical tumor pathways, induce apoptosis, and inhibit angiogenesis, demonstrating their versatility in targeting various aspects of tumor progression. In immunotherapy, peptides act as antigens to stimulate robust immune responses or as immune checkpoint inhibitors to restore T cell activity, overcoming tumor immune evasion. These systems also harness the enhanced permeability and retention effect, facilitating preferential accumulation in tumor tissues while leveraging tumor microenvironment (TME)-responsive mechanisms, such as pH-sensitive or enzyme-triggered drug release, to achieve controlled, localized delivery. Collectively, peptide-functionalized PLGA systems represent a promising, versatile approach for precise cancer therapy that integrates innovative delivery strategies with highly specific, potent therapeutic agents.",,,

This study investigates the impact of high-fat diet-induced lipid metabolism on podocyte injury in uninephrectomized mice. Using targeted lipidomics analysis and podocyte-specific assays, the modification of lipid profiles attributed to a high-fat diet and the development of podocyte injury caused by lipid metabolism in mice that underwent unilateral nephrectomy were examined. Mice that underwent unilateral nephrectomy and were fed with a high-fat diet for 13 weeks exhibited progressive renal dysfunction, including the accumulation of lipid droplets in podocytes, vacuolization of tubular cells, and glomerular hypertrophy. Liquid chromatography-triple quadrupole mass spectrometry confirmed a significant increase in cholesteryl ester 20:4 levels in the podocytes of these mice. In vitro, cholesteryl ester 20:4 treatment reduced mitochondrial respiration capacity and mitochondrial glycolysis in podocytes. Furthermore, the treatment led to alterations in the protein expression levels associated with lipid metabolism and transport, mitochondrial activity, and autophagy, including ATP binding cassette subfamily A member 1 (ABCA1), carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 A (CPT1A), acyl-CoA cholesterol acyltransferase (ACAT), nuclear respiratory factor ½ (NRF½), dynamin-1-like protein (DRP1), and p62. Transcriptome sequencing analysis revealed impaired gene expression, which was associated with the progression of renal fibrosis in unilateral nephrectomy mice with a high-fat diet. Specifically, the expression of matrix metalloproteinases and collagen genes, including fibronectin and collagen IV, was upregulated, indicating fibrosis progression. In conclusion, lipidomics analysis identifies cholesteryl ester 20:4 as a key lipid metabolite accumulating in podocytes, which is associated with mitochondrial dysfunction and abnormal autophagy. This accumulation potentially contributes to structural and functional deterioration in the kidney and highlights its role in kidney damage and its potential as a therapeutic target in metabolic kidney diseases.",,,dstlkh@knu.ac.kr.

Most clinically approved LAI products are formulated using poly(lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) polymers. Historically, the development of PLGA-based LAI formulations has relied predominantly on trial-and-error methods, primarily due to a limited understanding of the complex factors involved in LAI formulations and insufficient analytical techniques available for characterizing individual PLGA polymers of the prepared formulations. This article offers a personal perspective on recent advancements in characterization methods for PLGA polymers within final formulations, i.e., products, as well as enhanced insights into the drug release mechanisms associated with LAI products. With a deeper understanding of PLGA polymer properties and drug release mechanisms, the formulation development process can transition from traditional trial-and-error practices to a more systematic Quality by Design (QbD) approach. Additionally, this article explores the emerging role of artificial intelligence (AI) in formulation science and its potential, when applied carefully, to enhance the future development of PLGA-based LAI formulations.",,,kpark@purdue.edu.

However, public disclosure of the costs of individual clinical trials is rare. Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) sponsored a phase 2b-3 randomised controlled trial (TB-PRACTECAL), which identified a new treatment regimen for drug-resistant TB. We aimed to analyse the costs of undertaking a pivotal clinical trial conducted in relatively low-resource health settings and to demonstrate the feasibility of reporting clinical trial costs. TB-PRACTECAL trial costs were analysed using MSF accounting documents. Costs were broken down by cost category, year, and trial site. Total costs for TB-PRACTECAL were €33.9 million and the average cost per patient was €61,460. Twenty-six percent of total costs represented central activities (e.g. trial planning, trial management) and 72% represented trial site activities, with 2% uncategorizable. Within trial site costs, personnel costs were the largest cost (43%) followed by external diagnostic services (11%), medicines (9%), and other medical consumables (7%). Cost variation across trial sites was driven by different varying levels of pre-existing trial infrastructure. A review of previous studies yielded a wide range of cost estimates for clinical trials (ranging US$7-221 million/trial for pharmaceutical phase 2 and 3 trials). Nearly all previous estimates derive from industry reporting that is neither standardized nor auditable; to our knowledge, this is the first published comprehensive analysis of direct expenditures of a specific clinical trial including detailed cost breakdowns. The €34 million cost of TB-PRACTECAL included investments in developing clinical trial infrastructure, the complexity of managing six sites across three health systems, and medical expenditures that are not typical of standard clinical trials. Greater transparency in drug development costs can inform medicine pricing negotiations and is a key element in the design and implementation of more equitable systems of biomedical research and development.",Gotham D; Martin M; Barber MJ; Kazounis E; Batts C; Scourse R; Elder G; Nyang'wa BT,MSF Access Campaign; MSF UK,

Staphylococcal food poisoning (SFP) is increasingly prevalent worldwide, yet it is not reportable in Singapore, leaving a knowledge gap regarding the clinical incidence and virulence of local strains. This study examined the genetic diversity, antimicrobial resistance (AMR), and virulence determinants of S. aureus in RTE, and cooked food using both conventional testing and whole-genome sequencing (WGS) tools. We retrospectively analyzed 12178 RTE, and cooked food samples collected in Singapore from 2020 to 2023, detecting S. aureus in 0.19 % (23/12178) of samples. Genotype t4171_ST1155 was most common (4/23), followed by t91_ST2990 (3/23). Immunoassays detected the production of classical staphylococcal enterotoxin (SE) A, B, and C types in 43.5 % (10/23) of the isolates. Additionally, genomic analysis identified three more isolates that contained only non-classical SE genes, which were not detectable through immunoassays.

In order to assess the efficacy of adjuvant therapy in these patients, we conducted this systematic review and meta-analysis. We conducted a thorough search in various databases, which included MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, ASCO Abstracts, ESMO Abstracts and ClinicalTrials.gov. All relevant randomized controlled trials investigating the adjuvant chemotherapy compared with observation in resected biliary tract cancer were identified. The primary outcome of interest was overall survival (OS), while secondary outcome was relapse-free survival (RFS). Statistical analyses were conducted using Review Manager 5.3. Additionally, publication bias was evaluated using Egger's test in Stata 12.0. A total of 5 randomized controlled trials, involving 1406 patients, were included in this analysis. Compared with observation, adjuvant chemotherapy improved RFS [HR 0.84 (0.73-0.96), p=0.01] (I2=0%, p=0.89) but not OS [HR 0.89 (0.77-1.03), p=0.12] (I2=51%, p=0.09) in the entire population after BTC resection. Subgroup analyses revealed that adjuvant chemotherapy did improve both OS [HR 0.76 (0.62-0.93), p=0.009] (I2=7%, p=0.37) and RFS [HR 0.74 (0.58-0.95), p=0.02] (I2=0%, p=0.39) in patients with lymph node positivity. Furthermore, patients receiving oral fluoropyrimidine monotherapy showed benefit from the adjuvant therapy, with longer OS [HR 0.78 (0.65-0.94), p=0.009] (I2=2%, p=0.31) and RFS [HR 0.81 (0.68-0.95), p=0.01] (I2=0%, p=0.95). To conclude, adjuvant chemotherapy have the potential to offer advantages in patients with resected BTC. Specifically, patients demonstrating positive lymph node status have a higher likelihood of benefiting from adjuvant therapy. Our analysis supports the current standard of care of adjuvant fluoropyrimidine. However, the recommendation of oral fluoropyrimidine monotherapy as the preferred option is not definitive, as it is based on limited studies.

The evidence base of IEPs goes beyond traditional randomized controlled trials to provide holistic evidence suitable for all stakeholders and allows for consideration of different packages in different regions. However, this approach to drug development is not systematically adopted by all sponsors because of perceived uncertainty in its investment value. We introduce the concept of value drivers to which we apply an expected net present value (eNPV) model of the cash flows for drug development and commercialization. The approach is outlined for two, typical, hypothetical lifecycle management IEPs. The measure of IEP value is defined as the increment in eNPV that occurs when IE programs are employed in comparison to when they are not. We found substantial value for IEPs. One example incorporated a plan to conduct an observational study that could be used as a basis for approval in lieu of a classical phase II trial for a supplemental indication. In the other example, increased adoption of the new treatment leads to a highly positive increment in eNPV based on the critical evidence generated in a phase IIIb study. Use of value drivers and eNPV-based value models when planning for IEPs can provide objective guidance for project teams. The value can be estimated through formal economic analysis that considers planned timelines, R&D costs, estimates of the likelihood of regulatory approval, patient access and clinical adoption if development is successful.",Olson MS; Capkun G,Olson Strategies GmbH; Merck Healthcare KGaA,joseph.dimasi@tufts.edu.

However, the extent of antibody cross-reactivity against human seasonal coronaviruses, such as NL63, remains unclear. Furthermore, it is unknown whether pre-existing antibody responses against NL63 might influence the outcome of SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccination. We used a flow cytometry-based serological assay and an in vitro neutralization assay to analyze NL63 antibody responses in sera from SARS-CoV-2 mRNA-vaccinated mice and plasma samples from a vaccinated human cohort. We found that the Moderna mRNA-1273 vaccine can generate cross-reactive antibodies against NL63. Importantly, SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccination did not boost pre-existing anti-NL63 responses in humans, and pre-existing NL63 antibody levels did not affect the antibody response induced by SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccination. These findings suggest that while SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccination can induce cross-reactive antibodies against NL63, pre-existing immunity to this seasonal coronavirus does not appear to significantly impact vaccine immunogenicity.

While DL-3-n-butylphthalide (NBP) has shown promise in treating IS, its clinical application is limited by hepatotoxicity. G-3702, a structural analog of NBP, has emerged as a potential alternative with reduced hepatotoxicity and proposed pro-angiogenic effects. However, the precise mechanisms underlying G-3702's therapeutic effects in IS remain unclear, hindering its optimization and the identification of novel therapeutic targets. This gap in understanding is particularly significant given the potential of pro-angiogenic treatments to address ischemia-induced vascular damage and improve long-term recovery. Here, we employed an integrated approach combining metabolomics, transcriptomics, and machine learning to elucidate G-3702's mechanisms of action in a photothrombotic stroke mouse model. Untargeted metabolomics and pathway analysis explored G-3702's metabolic impacts, while network pharmacology and machine learning algorithms refined key therapeutic target identification. We validated computational insights through immunofluorescence and qPCR experiments. Our results demonstrated that G-3702 significantly improved neurological outcomes and reduced cerebral cortex necrosis in IS mice. Metabolomics implicated the Avb3 integrin pathway in G-3702's pro-angiogenic effects, while computational analyses highlighted the PI3K-Akt and HIF-1α pathways as central to this action. Machine learning algorithms prioritized potential biomarkers and targets, including BDNF, FGF2, ITGAV, ITGB3, SRC, and RHOA. Immunofluorescence confirmed enhanced angiogenesis, and qPCR demonstrated increased expression of these angiogenesis-related genes following G-3702 treatment. These findings suggest that G-3702 promotes angiogenesis in the ischemic brain area primarily via the Avb3 integrin pathway, offering a mechanistic explanation for its therapeutic effects in IS. By elucidating G-3702's mode of action, this study not only enhances its clinical potential but also contributes to the broader field of stroke treatment by identifying novel therapeutic targets. Our integrated approach to mechanism elucidation advances the understanding of pro-angiogenic treatments for stroke and may serve as a model for future drug development efforts in IS and other complex neurological disorders. Ultimately, this work enhances G-3702's potential for clinical translation as an improved stroke therapy and opens new avenues for optimizing post-stroke recovery.",,,

This study investigated the presence of BAs including tyramine and histamine in 240 samples of some cheese and fermented milk samples using high-performance liquid chromatography. Another aim of this study is to isolate and identify Enterococcus spp. as the most important and frequent BA producer in the examined samples. The isolated Enterococcus spp. was investigated phenotypically for their capacity to produce amino acid decarboxylase enzyme using decarboxylase microplate assay, and genotypically through molecular detection of some genes encoding amino acid decarboxylation (tyrdc and hdc). Biogenic amines producing enterococci were then investigated for their antimicrobial resistance, biofilm production as well as their virulence determinants. Tyramine and histamine could be detected in 86.7 and 87.9% of the investigated samples with 52.9% being contaminated with Enterococcus spp. Significant correlation between the incidence of Enterococci enterococci and BAs formed in the examined samples (P < 0.0001). tyrdc and hdc genes were detected in 85 and 5% of amino acid decarboxylating Enterococcus spp., respectively.

The results showed that the rates of most virulence genes gelE, esp, ace, asa1, and cylA were 77.5. 47.5, 47.5, 35 and 7.5%, respectively, while the hyl gene was not detected in any isolates. The study highlights the significant presence of BAs (TYM and HIS) in cheese and fermented milk samples, with a strong correlation between enterococci contamination and TYM production. The high prevalence of tyramine-producing Enterococcus species poses a notable public health concern especially with the high prevalence of multidrug-resistant, biofilm production and virulence in BAs producing Enterococcus spp. in dairy products, emphasizing the urgent need for improved antimicrobial stewardship among food producers and veterinarians to mitigate the risk of transferring resistant strains to humans.",,,hhnnzz91@aun.edu.eg.

Grain polyphenols are widely recognized as natural active ingredients with high potential to treat chronic diseases due to their excellent postprandial hyperglycemic regulating effects. However, previous studies on polyphenols in grains mainly focused on the functional properties of free polyphenols and the extraction and physicochemical properties of bound polyphenols, ignoring the functional properties of bound polyphenols. Comprehensively understanding the binding properties of grain bound polyphenols (GBPs) and their mechanisms in regulating blood glucose levels is essential for developing and applying grain resources. This review summarizes the molecular interactions between GBPs and grain components and their effects on release characteristics and bioavailability at various stages. Meanwhile, the review focuses on elucidating the regulatory mechanism of post-release GBPs on postprandial hyperglycemia levels, incorporating insights from molecular docking, the gastrointestinal-brain axis, and gut flora. GBPs slow food digestion by occupying the active site of digestive enzymes and altering the secondary structure of enzymes and the hydrophobic environment of amino acid residues to inhibit enzyme activity. They modulate intestinal epithelial transport proteins (SGLT1, GLUT2, and GLUT4) to limit glucose absorption and increase glucose consumption. They also stimulate the release of short-term satiety hormones (CKK, GLP-1, and PYY) through the gastrointestinal-brain axis to decrease post-meal food intake. Furthermore, they optimize gut microbiota composition, promoting short-chain fatty acid production and bile acid metabolism. Therefore, developing functional foods with glucose-modulating properties based on GBPs is crucial for obesity prevention, diabetes management, and low-GI food development.",,,wl0519@163.com.

In this study, multifunctional antibacterial and antioxidant fruit preservation films were developed by incorporating natural plant actives of proanthocyanidins and carvacrol essential oils into chitosan-dialdehyde cellulose composite films. The composite film had good mechanical properties, with a tensile strength of 78.8 MPa, a free radical scavenging rate of over 90 %, and enhanced barrier properties against UV light and water vapor. The diameters of the inhibition zones of the composite film for S. aureus and E. coli were 23.65 mm and 22.37 mm, respectively. In addition, the composite film was biocompatible and the survival rate of cells treated with the composite film solution was more than 90 %. Using strawberries as model fruit, we showed that the composite film could effectively inhibit the growth of colonies on the surface of the fruit and reduce the weight loss rate.

This study evaluated the effectiveness of biopreservation using eight plant-based protein extracts (PBPEs) (pea, faba, soy, potato, pumpkin, hazelnuts, rice, and hemp) fermented with 12 different lactic acid bacteria (LAB) strains from four species. The effectiveness of LAB biopreservation was assessed both at the endpoint and in real-time using impedometric analysis and was found to depend on both the matrix and the strain. Among the 12 LAB strains, Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophilus showed the highest adaptability, particularly in soy, faba, and hemp protein extracts, highlighting their potential as effective biopreservative agents for diverse PBPEs. Given the distinctive advantage of biopreservation in enhancing organoleptic properties, this aspect was also evaluated for the two most effective LAB strains. Fermentation with L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus 1932 and L. plantarum 4193 significantly improved the aroma profile of fermented PBPEs (pea, faba, soy, pumpkin, rice, and hemp) where they exhibited the best adaptability. Notably, levels of hexanal and hexanoic acid, compounds often associated with off-flavors, were markedly reduced, enhancing the organoleptic properties of the final products. These findings emphasize the dual benefits of LAB fermentation as a natural preservative and flavor enhancer, with promising implications for its application in the food industry.",,,elena.bancalari@unipr.it.

While we previously demonstrated the beneficial role of IL-7 in early porcine embryonic development, the underlying molecular mechanisms remained unclear. We hypothesized that IL-7 would enhance early embryogenesis and promote inner cell mass (ICM) formation via PI3K/AKT pathway activation. To test this, embryos were cultured with wortmannin (Wort), a PI3K inhibitor, with or without IL-7 after parthenogenetic activation. IL-7 supplementation significantly increased cleavage and blastocyst formation rates compared to the control (p < 0.05), while mitigating Wort-induced developmental impairment. Moreover, IL-7 significantly reduced blastocyst apoptosis and increased total cell numbers compared to the control (p < 0.05), thereby counteracting pro-apoptotic effects of Wort. Furthermore, IL-7 treatment significantly promoted ICM formation through the PI3K/AKT pathway, as demonstrated by increased SOX2 + cell numbers and ICM-specific gene expression, with elevated phosphorylated AKT levels compared to the control (p < 0.05). Notably, IL-7 significantly improved mitochondrial function and biogenesis-related gene expression compared to the control (p < 0.05) through a PI3K/AKT-independent pathway. These findings suggest that IL-7-mediated PI3K/AKT signaling enhances porcine early embryonic development in vitro, providing insights into mechanisms that regulate early embryonic development in mammals.",,,shhyun@cbu.ac.kr.

Temozolomide (TMZ)-based chemotherapy is a standard treatment for GBM, but development of chemoresistance poses a significant therapeutic challenge. Despite advances in understanding GBM biology, the mechanisms driving TMZ resistance remain unclear. Identifying vital molecular players involved in this resistance is crucial for developing new therapies. Our results indicated that periostin (POSTN) was significantly upregulated in GBM cell lines and patient samples, correlating with poorer clinical outcomes. POSTN overexpression enhanced GBM cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and chemoresistance, while lentiviral suppression of POSTN significantly reduced these behaviors. In vivo, bioluminescence imaging further confirmed the enhanced tumor growth associated with POSTN overexpression. Bioinformatics analysis was performed to explore the underlying molecular mechanism. The results revealed a strong correlation between POSTN and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process and the tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα)-NF-κB signaling pathway. Moreover, exogenous POSTN silencing reduced IκB-kinase α (IKKα) phosphorylation, thereby decreasing NF-κB expression by limiting IκBα degradation. Collectively, our study demonstrated that POSTN-induced activation of NF-κB signaling and EMT processes promoted the malignancy and chemoresistance of GBM, suggesting that POSTN may serve as a reliable prognostic biomarker and potential therapeutic target for GBM.",,,zhangming01@xjtu.edu.cn.

However, the molecular regulation mechanism that mediates the sublethal effect of insecticides on crop pests remains unsolved. Here, we show that the sublethal effect of spinetoram and cyantraniliprole on Spodoptera frugiperda is mediated by the molecular module of microRNA-9993/microRNA-2a-3p - farnesyl diphosphate synthase gene (FPPS)/juvenile hormone (JH) acid methyltransferase gene (JHAMT) - JH. Spinetoram prolonged the duration of larvae and pupae, decreased the weight of pupae, while cyantraniliprole prolonged the duration of larvae and decreased the emergence rate. Similarly, injection of the juvenile hormone analogue (JHA) methoprene significantly prolonged the developmental duration of larvae and pupae, decreased the pupal weight and emergence rate. This sublethal phenotypic change was due to the upregulation of key JH synthesis genes, including FPPS and JHAMT, mediated by spinetoram and cyantraniliprole, resulting in an increase in JH titer. Furthermore, it was confirmed by small RNA sequencing, dual luciferase analysis and agomir-miRNA injection, miR-9993 and miR-2a-3p that it could bind FPPS and JHAMT respectively, and regulated the expression level of FPPS and JHAMT to affect the titer of JH, thus changing the phenotype of S. frugiperda. Collectively, these results provide insights into the mechanism of insecticide regulation of sublethal effects of pests, expand our understanding of development-related miRNAs, and reveal key factors involved in JH signaling pathways that support sublethal effects of insecticides.",Zhang W,Shandong Green Blue Biotechnology Co.,scrczhm@163.com.

However, the hazards of concurrent exposed to MPs and EMB on the carp spleen, and the specific mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we employed MPs and EMB-exposed carp models, and cultured splenocytes in vitro, to demonstrate that PPARα signals suppression underlay MPs and EMB-induced carp spleen injury, based on transcriptomics and lipomics analysis. This suppression exacerbated the buildup of polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA), and promoted ACSL4 expression, resulting in increased lipid peroxidation. Further studies found that the accumulation of lipid peroxides predominantly occurred in the mitochondria, which evoked mitochondrial homeostasis imbalance and compromised mitochondrial function, thereby initiating ferroptosis. Additionally, enhancing PPARα signaling, inhibiting ACSL4, or scavenging mitochondrial ROS was favor of mitigating accumulation of lipid peroxides, reducing mitochondrial damage and inhibiting ferroptosis. Notably, MPs and EMB co-exposure caused more severe damage than single exposure. These findings uncovered a potential mechanism, involving PPARα signaling inhibition by MPs and EMB co-exposure, which evoked lipid remodeling and increased ACSL4, to drive ferroptosis and carp splenic injury. This study highlighted the potential hazards to the aquaculture environments where co-exposure of MPs and EMB and provided reference for environmental toxicology research and the sustainable development of the aquaculture industry.",,,shiwenxu@neau.edu.cn.

However, as the current assessment of attachment type mainly relies on self-report questionnaires and can be prone to bias, there is a need to incorporate physiological factors along with psychological symptoms and history in this process. We aimed to predict the measurement of two important types of adult attachment with heart rate variability (HRV), early life stress experience, and subjective psychiatric symptoms. Five hundred eighty-two subjects with depressive disorder were recruited retrospectively from January 2015 to June 2021. The experience of early life stress and psychiatric symptoms were collected, and HRV measures were obtained as input for an ensembled Voting Regressor model of machine learning-based regression models, including linear regression, ElasticNet, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest, and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost). Model performances evaluated with R-squared score averaged across 30 seeds were 0.377 and 0.188 for anxious- and avoidant-attachment, respectively. Mean absolute error averaged to 13.251 and 12.083, respectively. Shapley value importance analysis indicated that for both attachment types, the most important feature was the trait-anxiety, followed by emotional abuse, state-anxiety or self-reported depressive symptoms, and fear or helplessness felt in the moment of an early life stressor. Our results provide the evidence base that may be utilized in clinical settings to predict the degree of attachment type using bio-psychological factors.",,,

After two rounds of evaluation, a risk assessment system consisting of 10 primary indicators and 73 secondary indicators was finalized. The expert participation rate (100 %), authority coefficient (1.0), and Kendall's W value (0.222 for the first round and 0.316 for the second round) met the required standards. Moreover, the system exhibited high reliability and validity. Based on the AHP, the top three weighted primary indicators were ""seedstock management"" (0.2769), ""feeding and management"" (0.1429), and ""cleaning, disinfection and harmless disposal"" (0.1429). The combined weight of the secondary indicators ranged from 0.00009 to 0.03027. In total, 6423 samples, including dead embryos and environmental samples, were collected from a poultry farm. By isolating Salmonella, assessing antimicrobial resistance, and performing whole-genome sequencing, the key risk points for contamination were identified. The implementation of targeted control measures based on the risk assessment model resulted in significant improvements. In particular, the overall antibody positivity rate decreased from 65.9 % to 8 %, the isolation rate of Salmonella from dead embryos decreased from 47.5 % to 3.75 %, and the isolation rate of Salmonella from the production environment of the hatchery workshop decreased from 10.1 % to 0.9 %.

Despite significant progress in improving these predictive models, balancing accuracy with computational complexity remains a challenge. Molecular topological and geometric features provide rich spatial information, crucial for improving prediction accuracy, but their extraction typically increases model complexity. To address this, we propose TGF-M (Topology-augmented Geometric Features for Molecular Property Prediction), a novel predictive model that optimizes feature extraction to enhance information capture and improve model accuracy, and reduces model complexity to lower computational cost. This approach enhances the model's ability to leverage both topological and geometric features without unnecessary complexity.

The use of fungicides represents an effective strategy in safeguarding sufficient food supply against phytopathogenic fungi; however, given the escalating pathogen resistance, there is an urgent need to develop new, highly efficient, and environmentally friendly green fungicides. In this study, 24 novel amidohydrazide derivatives were designed and synthesized by incorporating the bioactive amide and hydrazide groups into natural l-phenylalanine. The bioassays revealed that certain compounds exhibited remarkable inhibitory activity against agricultural pathogenic fungi, with compound A21 particularly displaying exceptional in vitro and in vivo fungicidal activity against Rhizoctonia solani. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) observations showed that treatment with compound A21 induced significant morphological changes in R. solani mycelia, including the cell membrane contraction. Transcriptomic analysis indicated that differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in R. solani treated with compound A21 were significantly enriched in pathways related to the carbohydrate metabolism and lipid metabolism, and the relative expression of representative DEGs was further validated by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). The increase in ergosterol content suggested that R. solani may counteract the drug stress of amidohydrazide compounds by enhancing ergosterol biosynthesis.

Cull dairy goats (n = 60) were randomly assigned to a control (CN, nonrinsed) and two vascular rinse treatments: BP and PAA. Goats were inoculated intradermally with Salmonella Enteritidis and slaughtered after a 7-day incubation. Vascular rinsing was performed postexsanguination via a catheter in the heart. Carcasses were skinned, eviscerated, sprayed with 5% lactic acid, and chilled (2°C) overnight. The superficial cervical, popliteal, medial iliac, and subiliac LNs were collected aseptically for Salmonella enumeration and phage titer determination. The longissimus dorsi (LD) and semimembranosus muscles were also excised, and stored for 1, 4, and 7 days for meat surface color measurements. PAA-treated carcasses showed lower (p < 0.05) temperatures and pH values within 8 h postmortem compared to CN and BP. The average counts of Salmonella in the LNs associated with PAA (3.4 ± 1.3 log CFU/g) were significantly lower compared to CN (3.8 ± 1.1 log CFU/g), with the lowest load observed in medial iliac LNs (2.7 ± 1.5 log CFU/g). Substantial phage titers were detected in LNs from BP-treated carcasses (7.0 ± 0.91 log PFU/g), and no differences were observed in Salmonella counts in BP compared to CN. The meat samples obtained from PAA-treated carcasses exhibited lower redness (a* values) and deoxymyoglobin in the LD (p < 0.05) but showed no differences in lightness or oxymyoglobin compared to BP and CN. Vascular rinsing has the potential to suppress Salmonella in the LNs with other antimicrobials and chemicals with different combinations and concentrations. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: This study investigates a method to control Salmonella in goat meat by rinsing carcasses with peracetic acid (PAA) or bacteriophages through the bloodstream after slaughter. The findings suggest that PAA can mitigate Salmonella levels in lymph nodes, potentially improving meat safety. While bacteriophage treatment did not significantly affect the bacterial count to observe differences with the control group, vascular rinsing could still be promising with different antimicrobial combinations. This research would help meat processors enhance food safety measures, reducing the risk of Salmonella contamination in meat products.",Campbell RE,Technical Services,

Among these, antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) have garnered significant attention from both academia and industry due to their great potential for cancer therapy. However, peptide-drug conjugates (PDCs) offer several advantages over ADCs, including more accessible industrial synthesis, versatile functionalization, high tissue penetration, and rapid clearance with low immunotoxicity. These factors position PDCs as up-and-coming drug candidates for future cancer therapy. Despite their potential, PDCs face challenges such as poor pharmacokinetic properties and low bioactivity, which hinder their clinical development. How to design PDCs to meet clinical needs is a big challenge and urgent to resolve. In this review, we first carefully analyzed the general consideration of successful PDC design learning from ADCs. Then, we summarised the basic functions of each component of a PDC construct, comprising of peptides, linkers and payloads. The peptides in PDCs were categorized into three types: tumor targeting peptides, cell penetrating peptide and self-assembling peptide. We then analyzed the potential of these peptides for drug delivery, such as overcoming drug resistance, controlling drug release and improving therapeutic efficacy with reduced non-specific toxicity. To better understand the potential druggability of PDCs, we discussed the pharmacokinetics of PDCs and also briefly introduced the current PDCs in clinical trials. Lastly, we discussed the future perspectives for the successful development of an oncology PDC.

One hundred sixty nursery pigs (6.0 ± 1.6 kg BW) were assigned to four treatments arranged in a 2 × 2 factor: antibiotic use and β-glucan supplementation (0.02% Algamune). Diets were fed for 5 weeks, at which eight pigs from each treatment were selected for tissue sample collection. During the overall experimental period, antibiotics improved (p < 0.05) ADG and G:F. In Week 5, β-glucan supplementation increased (p < 0.05) the ADG of pigs without antibiotics, whereas β-glucan supplementation had no effect in pigs with antibiotics. In Phase 3, β-glucan supplementation tended to increase (p = 0.061) ADFI of pigs without antibiotics, whereas β-glucan supplementation had no effect in pigs with antibiotics. Both antibiotics and β-glucan increased (p < 0.05) villus height in the duodenum. Supplementation of β-glucan reduced (p < 0.05) IgA in the jejunum and tended to reduce (p = 0.053) IgA in the ileum.

This study aimed to investigate the utility of P450 inhibition data in predicting drug-induced organ toxicities beyond DILI. We selected 364 drugs with ADR information as test drugs from the public database SIDER (Side Effect Resource). Our focus was on 10 groups of ADRs affecting the liver, kidney, heart, blood/hematopoietic system, intestines, muscle, and lungs, as classified by MedDRA. The inhibitory activities of 10 human P450s were evaluated in vitro using recombinant enzymes and luminescent substrates. Our analyses revealed notable associations between heart failure and the inhibition of CYP1A1, CYP1B1, and CYP3A4. Heart failure-positive drugs tended to exhibit strong inhibition of these P450s compared to heart failure-negative drugs.

Currently available databases provide insights into protein localization under steady-state conditions; however, stress-related dynamic localization changes remain poorly understood. Here, we present the Localizatome, a comprehensive database that captures stress-induced protein localization dynamics in living cells. Using an original high-throughput microscopy system and machine learning algorithms, we analysed the localization patterns of 10 287 fluorescent protein-fused human proteins in HeLa cells before and after exposure to oxidative stress. Our analysis revealed that 1910 proteins exhibited oxidative stress-dependent localization changes, particularly forming distinct foci. Among them, there were stress granule assembly factors and autophagy-related proteins, as well as components of various signalling pathways. Subsequent characterization identified some specific amino acid motifs and intrinsically disordered regions associated with stress-induced protein redistribution.

The detachment of hydrogel adhesives under the benign conditions is vital to the definitive surgical repair and implanted devices. Although stimuli-mediated detachment of hydrogel adhesives has been achieved, it is still a grand challenge to develop a transient adhesive with programmable adhesion and autonomous detachment from the substrate, especially the hairy skins.

The transient hydrogel shows tunable mechanical properties, adjustable adhesive strength, and autonomous sol-gel-sol transition with a programmable lifetime. Moreover, the transient hydrogel adhesive enables conformable and stable adhesion to various materials. In particular, the bioelectrode coated by the transient hydrogel adhesive allows to record stable and high-quality electromyogram, electrocardiogram, and electroencephalogram signals directly on the hairy skins without hair shaving.

Since the advent of  A comprehensive literature search was carried out in multiple databases to select articles/reviews on historical developments, manufacturing and analytical techniques, regulatory frameworks and clinical trials undertaken to assess gonadotrophin production, formulation processes and their integration into clinical practice. The analysis included mainly evidence from pharmaceutical sponsored randomised controlled trials (RCTs) as well as single arm, registration or post approval studies. Studies on new molecular entities were reviewed. Systematic reviews and meta-analyses, national registries were consulted. Laboratory developments, regulatory challenges, economic constraints, were considered. Over the past four decades, ART has seen remarkable improvements, including increased live birth rates in women of advanced ovarian age, reduced multiple births, and the advent of patient-friendly pen devices. Innovations such as recombinant FSH (rFSH) and biosimilars have expanded treatment options. However, the high cost of drug development as well as the complexity of the ART process have contributed to underpowered trials and reliance on meta-analyses, which often fail to account for confounding factors. While gonadotrophins have been shown to be effective for OS, unresolved issues, such as the role of supplementing LH activity in OS protocols, highlight the need for more robust trials. Collaboration between stakeholders is essential to standardise trial designs, define key outcomes and minimise bias. Emerging technologies, including AI and genetic testing, offer opportunities to refine embryo assessment and implantation outcomes, thus improving trial design.

Although controversy still exists regarding CR-mediated lifespan effects, many researchers are seeking interventions that mimic the effects of CR. Yeast has proven to be a useful model system for aging studies, including CR effects. We report here that yeast adapted through in vitro evolution to the severe cellular stress caused by loss of the Ulp2 SUMO-specific protease exhibit both enhanced growth rates and replicative lifespan, and they have altered gene expression profiles similar to those observed in CR. Notably, in certain evolved ulp2Δ lines, an increase in the auto-sumoylation of Ubc9 E2 SUMO-conjugating enzyme results in altered regulation of multiple targets involved in energy metabolism and translation at both transcriptional and post-translational levels. This increase is essential for the survival of aged cells and CR-mediated lifespan extension. Thus, we suggest that high Ubc9 auto-sumoylation exerts potent anti-aging effects by promoting efficient energy metabolism-driven improvements in cell replication abilities.

Mesenchymal stem cells release a set of bioactive molecules called ""secretome"" that regulates intercellular communication and cargo transfer in signaling pathways for PD treatment. Thus, this study aimed to evaluate the neuroprotective effects of neural-induced human adipose tissue-derived stem cell (NI-hADSC)-conditioned medium (NI-hADSC-CM) and its exosomes (NI-hADSC-Exo) in a rotenone (ROT)-induced model of PD in rats. The NI-hADSC-CM was collected from NI-hADSC after 14 days of neural differentiation, and its NI-hADSC-Exo were isolated using a tangential flow filtration system. ROT (1 mg/kg) was subcutaneously administered for 28 days to establish a model of PD in rats. The treatment of NI-hADSC-CM or NI-hADSC-Exo was intravenously injected on days 15, 18, 21, 24, and 27. Animal behavioral effects were explored via a rotarod test. After 28 days, histological and western blot analyses were performed to investigate the tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), α-synuclein (α-syn) aggregation, and downstream signaling pathways for experimental validation. NI-hADSC-Exo improved the motor balance and coordination skills against ROT toxicity. ROT reproduced the pathological features of PD, such as a decrease in TH-positive dopaminergic neurons and an increase in α-syn aggregation and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)-positive cells. NI-hADSC-CM and NI-hADSC-Exo improved the TH expression, decreased the Triton X-100 soluble and insoluble oligomeric p-S129 α-syn, and influenced the differential reactivity to astrocytes and microglia. Secretome treatment could reverse the ROT-induced damages in the neuronal structural and functional proteins, mitochondrial apoptosis, and caspase cascade. The treatment of NI-hADSC-CM and NI-hADSC-Exo ameliorated the ROT toxicity-induced serine-threonine protein kinase dysregulation and autophagy impairment to clear the aggregated α-syn. NI-hADSC-CM and NI-hADSC-Exo significantly exerted neuroprotection by decreasing α-syn toxicity, inhibiting neuroinflammation and apoptosis, restoring autophagic flux properties, and promoting the neuronal function in ROT-injected rats; however, the influence of these treatments on signaling pathways differed slightly between the midbrain and striatum regions.

This study investigated the effects of IGF-1 on early embryonic development in pig embryos, focusing on its interaction with the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, a key regulator of cell adhesion and proliferation. Porcine embryos were used for experiments with chemical treatments to study blastocyst development and underlying mechanism. Apoptosis, immunochemistry, gene expression, and protein quantification were performed, with statistical significance assessed. IGF-1 treatment during the early stages of embryonic development significantly enhanced developmental parameters, in particular blastocyst formation rates. Interestingly, IGF-1 increased trophectoderm (TE) cell proliferation. The TE is an essential component of the blastocyst, maintaining its structure. Successful development of pig embryos was dependent on the proper formation and function of the TE. IGF-1 upregulated the expression of functional proteins related to TE differentiation and tight junctions. Notably, these effects were more pronounced when IGF-1 treatment was performed during the last 3 days of embryonic development (days 3-6) compared to the first 3 days (days 0-3). In addition, we found that IGF-1 promoted activation of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, including increasing β-catenin levels and related gene expression. To confirm the interaction between IGF-1 signaling and the Wnt/β-catenin pathway in TE development, embryos were cultured with picropodophyllin, an IGF-1 receptor inhibitor. Picropodophyllin suppressed developmental parameters, β-catenin levels, TE cell differentiation, and tight junction formation. These effects were successfully rescued by IGF-1 and the Wnt/β-catenin signaling activator ChiR99021.

A549 and H460 cells were used to analyze the effect of GFPT2 on cisplatin chemotherapy sensitivity, as both carry KRAS mutations and H460 has LKB1 inactivation mutations, meeting the requirements of a KRAS/LKB1 co mutant tumor model. The levels of UDP-GlcNAc, OGT, OGA, and O-GlcNAc in the HBP pathway were also determined. To verify the potential role of HBP, we added OGT inhibitors. In vivo, we constructed a nude mouse model bearing A549 tumor to further validate the results of in vitro cell experiments. GFPT2 silencing can significantly inhibit cell proliferation, invasion, and migration, promote cell apoptosis, and enhance the effect of cisplatin (p < 0.05). After OSMI-1 processing, GFPT2 enhances O-GlcNAc modification levels via the OGT-mediated HBP, thereby decreasing the sensitivity of STK11/KRAS mutant cells to cisplatin chemotherapy. In addition, GFPT2 silencing enhances the chemotherapy sensitivity of cisplatin and inhibits tumor growth, while overexpression of GFPT2 weakens this effect (p < 0.05). The above results provide new targets and combination therapy options for the clinical treatment of KRAS/LKB1 mutant lung cancer. Our study found that inhibiting GFPT2 can enhance the chemotherapy sensitivity of cisplatin to STK11/KRAS/LKB1 mutant NSCLCs cells through the OGT mediated HBP pathway, filling a key gap in the chemotherapy resistance mechanism of KRAS/LKB1 mutant lung cancer.",Yin X; Wang P,Yantai Keyou Biotechnology Co.; Ministry of Scientific and Technological Innovation,wyr20011228@163.com.

Recently, we demonstrated that in Diet-induced-Obesity (DIO) mouse model, preventive furan fatty acids (FuFA-F2) supplementation, a natural compounds found in many foods, reduced the onset of metabolic disorders and increased muscle mass. Here, we aimed to determine whether a short FuFA-F2 supplementation is capable of providing beneficial health effects in obese mice, notably by reversing metabolic disorders and limiting cartilage degradation. 6-month-old obese C57Bl/6 J mice were fed for four additional weeks on a high-fat and high-sucrose (HFHS) diet, supplemented or not with FuFA-F2 (40 mg/day/kg of body weight). Liver triglyceride content and histologic analysis revealed that 4 weeks of FuFA-F2 supplementation fully reversed hepatic steatosis in obese mice. Liver RNA-sequencing analysis highlighted that FuFA-F2 partly reversed the gene expression signature induced by the HFHS diet and favorably changed the expression of many genes known to be involved in the development of hepatic steatosis such as Pcsk9, Stard4, Insig1 and Sulf2. We also found that FuFA-F2 supplementation increased skeletal muscle mass and protected against cartilage degradation and synovitis induced by obesity. Our findings demonstrated that FuFA-F2 supplementation for 4 weeks in obese mice was enough to reverse the development of MASLD, promote an increase in skeletal muscle mass and protect against cartilage degradation induced by the HFHS diet.

The Task Force agreed on the necessity and urgency of advancing combination therapies for AD treatment. As of January 1, 2024, in the drug development pipeline, there were 21 combination trials (13 % of all trials). The combination of anti-amyloid and anti-tau therapies could become a central focus of the field. Combinations involving anti-inflammatory and immune mechanisms with anti-amyloid or other therapies also have promise. To facilitate the development and implementation of combination therapies, collaborations between sponsors and public-private partnerships are essential.

This study aimed to explore the impact of melatonin (MT) treatment on the fruit quality of wolfberry stored at 4°C, using combined transcriptomics and metabolomics analyses. In this study, about 15% of the flavonoid metabolites differed significantly after MT treatment in yellow-fleshed wolfberry, especially for flavanols, flavanones, and flavonols. MT treatment enhanced esterified carotenoid content in red-fleshed wolfberry postharvest. Comparative transcriptomic analysis revealed that MT-induced upregulation of LbaF3'H, LbaHQT and LbaCHS1 might contribute to the increased flavonoids in yellow-flesh wolfberry, and that MT-induced upregulation of LbaPSY, LbaCRTISO and LbaCYCB are responsible for the increased carotenoids in red-flesh wolfberry. Coexpression network analysis showed that several transcription factors such as LbaGATA are involved in MT-mediated regulation of flavonoids and carotenoids. Dual luciferase assay evidenced that LbaGATA and LbaRKD5 depress the expression of LbaPSY.

Contaminated food is responsible for an estimated 600 million illnesses and 420,000 deaths annually, with low- and middle-income countries facing losses of approximately $110 billion each year. Traditional methods to ensure food safety, including antimicrobials and preservatives, can contribute to the development of antimicrobial-resistant bacteria, highlighting the need for alternative strategies. Bacteriophages are gaining renewed attention as promising alternatives to conventional antibiotics due to their specifically target bacteria and their lower potential for causing adverse effects. However, their practical application is limited by challenges such as narrow host ranges, the emergence of phage-resistant bacteria, and stability issues. Recent research has shifted focus towards phage-derived enzymes, including endolysins, depolymerases, holins, and spanins, which are involved in the phage lytic cycle. These enzymes, as potential approaches to food safety, have demonstrated significant efficacy in targeting and lysing bacterial pathogens, making them suitable for controlling foodborne pathogens and preventing foodborne illnesses. Phage-derived enzymes also show promise in controlling biofilms and enhancing antimicrobial activity when combined with other antimicrobials. Therefore, this review emphasizes recent advancements in the use of the phage-derived enzymes for food safety, addresses their limitations, and suggests strategies to enhance their effectiveness in food processing and storage environments.",,,tding@zju.edu.cn.

For instance, bacterial pathogens such as Escherichia coli O157:H7 and Salmonellaspp. will continue affecting the safety of raw beef, which means that there is a continuous need for advanced antimicrobial solutions, such as active food packaging technologies, which are able to ensure the microbial safety of the packaged beef, while enhancing its shelf life. The main goal of this work was the development of an antimicrobial food packaging solution for fresh beef meat, able to be effective without direct contact between package and food, by incorporating food flavourings in polymeric materials. To achieve this, the antimicrobial susceptibility of L. monocytogenes and S. enterica to diacetyl was evaluated. Then, diacetyl was entrapped in active gels through a gelation reaction involving sodium stearate and ethanol. Texture profile analysis was employed to determine the optimal amount of diacetyl that effectively inhibited the growth of Salmonella enterica at 37 °C without compromising the mechanical properties of the gel and its handling. Diacetyl release from the active gel and from an active gel blend with porous food-grade cyclodextrin nanosponges (CDNS) was quantified by gas chromatography coupled to a flame ionization detector (GC-FID) at 37 °C and 4 °C. At 4 °C, stearate gels released 0.13 ± 0.01 mg per gram of material while the CDNS blends were able to release 0.55 ± 0.05 mg per gram of material. In vivo testing of the antimicrobial efficacy of both components (gel and blend), in the form of sachets, was conducted in a packaged fresh beef meat artificially inoculated with Salmonella enterica under refrigerated storage. The blend displayed superior efficacy, inhibiting Salmonella by 77 %, on opposite to the gel (33 %). Furthermore, both sachets exhibited a high inhibitory effect (93 to 99 %) against common bacteria found in beef meat such as total viable counts, Pseudomonas spp. and lactic acid bacteria. The efficacy of these cost-effective and easy-to-produce antimicrobial GRAS sachets encourages their application as active food packaging technology, enhancing safety and extending the shelf life of fresh meat products.",,,druperez@unizar.es.

Research on these materials is crucial for developing healthier and safer products. Pupunha fruit (Bactris gasipaes) has emerged as a promising raw material for bakery products, but scientific research remains limited, particularly regarding the effects of the process on food development. Therefore, this study aimed to verify the effects of four different drying processes on the functional, structural, physicochemical, nutritional, and cytotoxic properties of pupunha flour (PF). PF was produced by freeze-drying (FDF), cooking followed by freeze-drying (CFDF), convection-drying (CDF), and cooking followed by convection-drying (CCDF). PF protein digestibility was determined using the INFOGEST protocol, free amino groups were quantified using the O-phthaldehyde (OPA) method, cytotoxicity was assessed using the method proposed by ISO 10993-5, and the phenolic and tannin concentration was determined using the Folin-Ciocalteau and vanillin-HCl reagents, respectively. In general, CDF flour presented higher antioxidant potential and bioactive compounds, especially tannins (85.94 mg of catechin equivalent/g of dry matter). When checking the influence of the phenolic extract on normal and cancer cells, it was evident that the CDF and FDF samples present significantly higher cytotoxicity as compared to the others (1.18 and 1.07 mg/mL for normal cells and 2.05 and 1.78 mg/mL for cancer cells, respectively). However, the protein hydrolysis in the CCDF, FDF, and CFDF samples was 24, 21, and 22 % higher than that in the CDF samples, respectively. The low protein hydrolysis values of the CDF sample were possibly due to the formation of tannin-protein complexes and the protein conformation that prevented hydrolysis by digestive enzymes. Despite these beneficial aspects, it has been shown that high levels of bioactive compounds are not always beneficial to protein bioaccessibility, and the processing of the fruit pulp could reduce these anti-nutritional compounds, resulting in a more suitable raw material. Further research related to bioactive compounds interactions with macronutrients in various types of foods must be developed, especially when using non-conventional materials with high potential for industrial and consumer use.",Colnago LA,Brazilian Corporation for Agricultural Research,yves.souza@usp.br.

Neurology,10.1016/S1474-4422(25)00068-7,"There remains a substantial unmet need for effective and safe treatments for neuropathic pain. The Neuropathic Pain Special Interest Group aimed to update treatment recommendations, published in 2015, on the basis of new evidence from randomised controlled trials, emerging neuromodulation techniques, and advances in evidence synthesis. For this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched Embase, PubMed, the International Clinical Trials Registry, and ClinicalTrials.gov from data inception for neuromodulation trials and from Jan 1, 2013, for pharmacological interventions until Feb 12, 2024. We included double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trials that evaluated pharmacological and neuromodulation treatments administered for at least 3 weeks, or if there was at least 3 weeks of follow-up, and which included at least ten participants per group. Trials included participants of any age with neuropathic pain, defined by the International Association for the Study of Pain. We excluded trials with enriched enrolment randomised withdrawal designs and those with participants with mixed aetiologies (ie, neuropathic and non-neuropathic pain) and conditions such as complex regional pain syndrome, low back pain without radicular pain, fibromyalgia, and idiopathic orofacial pain. We extracted summary data in duplicate from published reports, with discrepancies reconciled by a third independent reviewer on the platform Covidence. The primary efficacy outcome was the proportion of responders (50% or 30% reduction in baseline pain intensity or moderate pain relief). The primary safety outcome was the number of participants who withdrew from the treatment owing to adverse events. We calculated a risk difference for each comparison and did a random-effects meta-analysis. Risk differences were used to calculate the number needed to treat (NNT) and the number needed to harm (NNH) for each treatment. Risk of bias was assessed by use of the Cochrane risk of bias tool 2 and certainty of evidence assessed by use of GRADE. Recommendations were based on evidence of efficacy, adverse events, accessibility, and cost, and feedback from engaged lived experience partners. This study is registered on PROSPERO, CRD42023389375. We identified 313 trials (284 pharmacological and 29 neuromodulation studies) for inclusion in the meta-analysis.

Dysregulated inflammasome activation and pyroptosis signaling pathways are implicated in numerous inflammatory diseases. In our work, a set of novel thiazole amide compounds with inhibitory activity against NLRP3 inflammasome-induced pyroptosis was identified. Of all the compounds tested, compound 21 demonstrated the most potent anti-pyroptotic effects. It suppressed GSDMD cleavage and decreased IL-1β and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release in a concentration-dependent manner. Compound 21 bound to NLRP3 protein and increased the thermal stability of NLRP3 concentration-dependently. The molecular docking and dynamics simulations revealed that compound 21 binds to the NLRP3 protein's active site, suppressing inflammasome activation. Further investigations showed that compound 21 also partially blocked upstream NF-κB signaling and downstream GSDMD N-terminal domain (GSDMD-NT) oligomerization, which explains its broad inhibitory effects on pyroptosis driven by multiple inflammasomes. Overall, this study presents a promising thiazole amide compound with inhibitory activity against inflammasome activation and subsequent pyroptosis, warranting further exploration.",,,daizhen15@163.com.

The reconstruction of GRNs can help investigate cellular dynamics, drug design, and metabolic systems, and the rapid development of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technology provides important opportunities while posing significant challenges for reconstructing GRNs. A number of methods for inferring GRNs have been proposed in recent years based on traditional machine learning and deep learning algorithms. However, inferring the GRN from scRNA-seq data remains challenging owing to cellular heterogeneity, measurement noise, and data dropout. In this study, we propose a deep learning model called graph representational learning GRN (GRLGRN) to infer the latent regulatory dependencies between genes based on a prior GRN and data on the profiles of single-cell gene expressions. GRLGRN uses a graph transformer network to extract implicit links from the prior GRN, and encodes the features of genes by using both an adjacency matrix of implicit links and a matrix of the profile of gene expression. Moreover, it uses attention mechanisms to improve feature extraction, and feeds the refined gene embeddings into an output module to infer gene regulatory relationships. To evaluate the performance of GRLGRN, we compared it with prevalent models and performed ablation experiments on seven cell-line datasets with three ground-truth networks. The results showed that GRLGRN achieved the best predictions in AUROC and AUPRC on 78.6% and 80.9% of the datasets, and achieved an average improvement of 7.3% in AUROC and 30.7% in AUPRC. The interpretation discussion and the network visualization were conducted. The experimental results and case studies illustrate the considerable performance of GRLGRN in predicting gene interactions and provide interpretability for the prediction tasks, such as identifying hub genes in the network and uncovering implicit links.",,,zhoujw1982@jiangnan.edu.cn.

Specifically, an engineered nanocarrier was developed to protect the antigen and modulate its release profile. Then, the nanoparticles were enriched to form microneedle tips with superior mechanical and waterproof properties, allowing effective penetration of the buccal mucosa and resistance to salivary washout. Besides, the microneedles demonstrated an S-curve antigen release pattern which was crucial for the recruitment of antigen presenting cells (APCs) and the downregulation of mucosal tolerogenic DCs and Treg cells. The buccal microneedle vaccine without any immune stimulators induced potent systemic and mucosal immune responses, resulting in superior protection of mice from the oral challenge of Helicobacter pylori.

The study aimed to isolate lactic acid bacteria (LAB) from raw cow milk and evaluate their probiotic potential. Twelve gram-positive isolates showing tolerance to bile salt, acid, and low pH were identified by 16S rRNA sequencing, which revealed the isolates belong to the genera including Lactococcus, Enterococcus, Streptococcus, Bacillus, and Weissella. In case of probiotic potential, the isolates exhibited arrays of probiotic properties: autoaggregation (33.65-84.63 %), co-aggregation (8.17-83.22 %), cell surface hydrophobicity for both polar (13.37-90.24 %) and non-polar solvents (5.52-53.58 %) and able to form biofilm (75 % weak, 16.67 % moderate and 8.33 % strong). Statistical analysis revealed the correlation pattern between the probiotic properties and showed a significant strong positive correlation between cell surface hydrophobicity and aggregation. Additionally, three isolates L. lactis, W. confusa, and E. gallinarum that were sensitive to antibiotics, able to produce biofilm, and did not contain virulence genes were able to reduce the biofilm formation of pathogen K. pneumoniae (1.3-4 log) in the co-culture assay. These Findings suggest that LAB from the raw cow milk could serve as a natural biocontrol agent for preventing and controlling K. pneumoniae biofilm formation and pave the way for innovative intervention of LAB in food safety and clinical settings.",Jhuma TA; Moniruzzaman M,Central Analytical and Research Facilities (CARF),abhibcsir@gmail.com.
40249543,Environmental and Health Consequences of Pharmaceutical Disposal Methods: A Scoping Review.,2025-05-16,Environmental management,10.1007/s00267-025-02167-5,"The global rise in pharmaceutical production and consumption has led to an increase in pharmaceutical waste, posing significant risks to both public health and the environment. Improper disposal methods contribute to environmental degradation, including disruptions to aquatic ecosystems and the spread of antimicrobial resistance. Despite these growing concerns, a comprehensive review of pharmaceutical waste management and disposal practices is still lacking. To address this gap, a scoping review was conducted, analyzing 4269 records from three databases (Medline OVID, Web of Science, and Embase) and grey literature, with 67 studies ultimately included. The initial records were identified through a comprehensive search across the aforementioned databases using a structured strategy based on three core concepts: medication waste, disposal methods, and environmental or human health impacts. This was followed by a two-stage screening process guided by the PCC framework and predefined inclusion criteria. The review aims to assess disposal practices and their impacts, identify research gaps, and guide future research toward effective strategies for managing pharmaceutical waste while protecting ecological balance and public health. The publications timeline shows increasing interest in the topic, particularly with a surge in studies during 2022 and 2023. The findings reveal a significant regulatory gap, especially in the Global South, where limited infrastructure and public awareness lead to reliance on household waste disposal. In contrast, medication take-back programs are more common in the Global North. This disparity underscores the urgent need for policy development. Addressing pharmaceutical waste effectively requires coordinated efforts from the pharmaceutical industry, healthcare providers, regulatory bodies, and local communities. Key strategies should include regulatory action, public education, technological innovation, and addressing issues like drug misuse and overconsumption, particularly of antibiotics, which contribute to antimicrobial resistance. A holistic approach is essential to mitigate both environmental and public health risks.",,,mm35@aub.edu.lb.

In this study, we collected 34 A. veronii isolates from aquatic animals in Sichuan, China. Six housekeeping genes (gyrB, groL, gltA, metG, ppsA and recA) were used for multilocus sequence typing. The results showed that the isolates had high diversity, of which 21 subtypes could be divided into two groups. The group B consisted of 15 new sequence types (ST861-875), and the group A was more closely related to strains from water. Besides, the antibiotic susceptibility of each isolate was determined using the disc diffusion method. Discs of 17 antimicrobial agents were used, including penicillin, cefaclor, cefotaxime, meropenem, amoxicillin, kanamycin, gentamycin, amikacin, neomycin, ciprofloxacin, enrofloxacin, tetracycline, doxycycline, florfenicol, cotrimoxazole, rifampicin, and azithromycin. Most isolates showed resistance to 17 antibiotics such as penicillin, enrofloxacin, and doxycycline. Moreover, high-throughput qPCR was used to detect ARGs of the isolates. A total of 62 ARGs were detected positively based on 95 ARGs detection, in which class aminoglycosides, beta-lactams, and multiple drugs were the most prevalent. Our study indicated that different genotypes showed different distribution of ARPs and ARGs. To our knowledge, this is the first report of molecular subtyping and antibiotic resistance profiles in A. veronii from aquatic animals in Sichuan, these data provide a valuable referee for the prevention and control of corresponding diseases.",Deng L; Li T,Yalong River Hydropower Development Company Ltd.,gengyisicau@126.com.
40249341,Effect of Uncertainty-Aware AI Models on Pharmacists' Reaction Time and Decision-Making in a Web-Based Mock Medication Verification Task: Randomized Controlled Trial.,2025-04-18,JMIR medical informatics,10.2196/64902,"Artificial intelligence (AI)-based clinical decision support systems are increasingly used in health care. Uncertainty-aware AI presents the model's confidence in its decision alongside its prediction, whereas black-box AI only provides a prediction. Little is known about how this type of AI affects health care providers' work performance and reaction time. This study aimed to determine the effects of black-box and uncertainty-aware AI advice on pharmacist decision-making and reaction time. Recruitment emails were sent to pharmacists through professional listservs describing a web-based, crossover, randomized controlled trial. Participants were randomized to the black-box AI or uncertainty-aware AI condition in a 1:1 manner. Participants completed 100 mock verification tasks with AI help and 100 without AI help. The order of no help and AI help was randomized. Participants were exposed to correct and incorrect prescription fills, where the correct decision was to ""accept"" or ""reject,"" respectively. AI help provided correct (79%) or incorrect (21%) advice. Reaction times, participant decisions, AI advice, and AI help type were recorded for each verification. Likelihood ratio tests compared means across the three categories of AI type for each level of AI correctness. A total of 30 participants provided complete datasets. An equal number of participants were in each AI condition. Participants' decision-making performance and reaction times differed across the 3 conditions. Accurate AI recommendations resulted in the rejection of the incorrect drug 96.1% and 91.8% of the time for uncertainty-aware AI and black-box AI respectively, compared with 81.2% without AI help. Correctly dispensed medications were accepted at rates of 99.2% with black-box help, 94.1% with uncertainty-aware AI help, and 94.6% without AI help. Uncertainty-aware AI protected against bad AI advice to approve an incorrectly filled medication compared with black-box AI (83.3% vs 76.7%). When the AI recommended rejecting a correctly filled medication, pharmacists without AI help had a higher rate of correctly accepting the medication (94.6%) compared with uncertainty-aware AI help (86.2%) and black-box AI help (81.2%). Uncertainty-aware AI resulted in shorter reaction times than black-box AI and no AI help except in the scenario where ""AI rejects the correct drug."" Black-box AI did not lead to reduced reaction times compared with pharmacists acting alone. Pharmacists' performance and reaction times varied by AI type and AI accuracy. Overall, uncertainty-aware AI resulted in faster decision-making and acted as a safeguard against bad AI advice to approve a misfilled medication. Conversely, black-box AI had the longest reaction times, and user performance degraded in the presence of bad AI advice. However, uncertainty-aware AI could result in unnecessary double-checks, but it is preferred over false negative advice, where patients receive the wrong medication. These results highlight the importance of well-designed AI that addresses users' needs, enhances performance, and avoids overreliance on AI.",,,

However, currently, there has been only one regulatory approved drug for MASH (Rezdiffra). Pioglitazone, a commonly used type 2 diabetes mellitus drug, is currently used off-label for the treatment of MASH. Our study aimed to perform a model-based meta-analysis to quantitatively examine the efficacy of pioglitazone in improving histological parameters and liver enzymes in patients with MASH. A comprehensive search was performed in Pubmed and clinicaltrials.gov. We collected histological outcomes (including steatosis, inflammation, ballooning, and fibrosis) and liver enzyme data. Due to sparse data, the gathered histological outcomes were used to generate virtual data. Next, model development for the virtual histological dataset was performed using a logistic model. In addition, Weibull and exponential models were tested to find the best fit for liver enzyme data. Model evaluations were carried out by visual predictive check, bootstrap method, and stacked bar plot. Eight studies with 540 patients were included. A logit model was used to analyze four outcomes. The results showed that using pioglitazone improved all four histological parameters. These effects are dose- and time-dependent under the Emax-time model for steatosis and ballooning, and under the linear relationship for inflammation and fibrosis. For liver enzymes, the Weibull model fitted well for both ALT and AST data. In conclusion, the developed models of pioglitazone may serve as a benchmark to assess the effectiveness of novel MASH-targeted treatments.",,,

The reward deficiency syndrome (RDS) model proposes blunted responses to natural rewards that potentially contribute to the development of addictive behaviors. The 29-item Reward Deficiency Syndrome Questionnaire (RDSQ-29) was developed to assess RDS-related psychological-behavioral characteristics. The aim of the present study was to validate the Hebrew version of the RDSQ-29 and to provide empirical evidence for the relevance of RDS in addictive behaviors and related psychological features. The sample comprised 961 Jewish Israeli young adults from the general community (age 19-27 years; M = 23.40 years [SD = 1.95]) who were assessed for personality characteristics (attachment styles, RDS, compulsive personality), internet gaming disorder (IGD), problematic use of social media use (PUSM), compulsive buying-shopping disorder (CBSD), and gambling disorder (GD). The analysis confirmed the validity and factor structure of the RDSQ-29. RDSQ-29 scores showed a significant but weak association with anxiety, avoidance, and compulsive personality. Also, weak to modest relationships were found between RDSQ-29 scores and the severity of the four potential behavioral addictions. The findings suggest that the Hebrew translation of the RDSQ-29 is a psychometrically sound instrument to assess RDS. Given that different potentially addictive and other problematic behaviors are associated with RDS, its assessment might be useful in prevention or screening.",,,

Photothermal therapy (PTT) and photodynamic therapy (PDT) have received increasing attention in antimicrobial fields due to their precision treatment and less susceptibility to inducing resistance. In particular, developing second near-infrared (NIR-II, 1000-1700 nm)-emissive semiconducting polymers for phototheranostics is highly desirable but remains challenging due to the lack of rational molecular design guidelines. Herein, a precise side-chain engineering strategy based on donor-acceptor (D-A)-type semiconductor polymers is developed for antimicrobial phototherapy. By subtle regulation of the side-chain flexibility, a series of NIR-II-emissive polymer aggregation-induced-emission (AIE) luminogens (AIEgens) are constructed. The optimal polymer PIDT(He)TBT bearing flexible side chains shows optimal physicochemical properties, including the highest mass extinction coefficient, the best AIE property, red-shifted absorption/emission spectra, and desirable photodynamic and photothermal effects. PIDT(He)TBT is then encapsulated into nanoparticles to endow them with water solubility, excellent photostability, and enhanced type-I photodynamic and photothermal effects. The excellent performance of PIDT(He)TBT nanoparticles in terms of fluorescence-guided type-I PDT and PTT of bacterial and fungal infections has been demonstrated both in vitro and in vivo. This work brings useful insights into designing NIR-II-emissive semiconducting polymer AIEgens for highly efficient phototheranostics.",Gao Y,Suzhou Sanegene Bio Inc.,

Conventional monotherapy is ineffective, and the efficacy of drug delivery is limited by the depth of drug penetration. In this study, we develop a novel, multifunctional, dissolvable hyaluronic acid (HA) microneedle patch (MN-LTT). Microneedling is biocompatible and delivers the drug in a painless and non-invasive manner. Lidocaine and thrombin are mixed with HA hydrogel and loaded onto the needle tips of the MN-LTT, which facilitates wound repair by continuously delivering the drug deep into the dermis for rapid analgesia and hemostasis. In addition, the backing layer of the MN-LTT is composed of tetracycline hydrochloride and HA hydrogel, and its excellent antimicrobial properties further accelerate wound healing. In a mouse full-thickness skin wound model, MN-LTT accelerated cell proliferation and granulation tissue growth, reduced inflammatory-factor levels, and restored collagen deposition, resulting in complete wound healing within seven days. Thus, the proposed microneedle delivery system achieved rapid hemostatic, analgesic, and bactericidal effects, providing a safer and more effective strategy for wound healing.

However, the extent to which these training interventions influence lower-limb landing biomechanics in youth female remains unclear. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to quantitatively summarise the effectiveness of various training interventions on jump-landing biomechanics in youth females. We systematically searched PubMed, SPORTDiscus, EMBASE and Scopus. Articles were included if they: (1) conducted research on uninjured youth females (reported mean age < 18 years) with no restriction on playing level/experience or physical activity level; (2) performed any form of training intervention for ≥ 4 weeks; (3) reported any lower-limb kinematic (flexion/extension, adduction/abduction or internal/external rotation angles) or kinetic (joint moments or vertical ground reaction forces) data during the landing phase of jump-landing tasks, pre- and post-training intervention for both experimental and control groups, using a two- or three-dimensional motion capture system; (4) were randomised- or non-randomised controlled trials. The quality of the randomised controlled trials was assessed using the Risk of Bias tool 2, whereas the Downs and Black checklist was used for assessing the quality of non-randomised controlled trials. A multi-level meta-analytical model was used for conducting the quantitative analysis. Thirteen studies (7 randomised controlled, 6 non-randomised controlled studies) involving 648 female participants were included in the final analyses. With regards to the overall quality of the included studies, three studies had high risk of bias while ten studies had some concerns. As part of the meta-analysis, we were able to analyse seven kinematic variables and two kinetic variables in aggregate. Compared with controls, the experimental group had significantly increased peak knee flexion angle (g = 0.58, p = 0.05) and reduced knee valgus motion (g =  - 0.86, p = 0.05) post-intervention. The effects on other kinematic and kinetic variables ranged from trivial to moderate and were not significantly altered as a result of various training interventions. The findings from the synthesised literature indicate that training interventions have small to moderate effects on peak knee flexion angle and knee valgus motion during jumping tasks.

It is listed as the top grade in the famous herbal monograph Shennong Materia Medica Classic. Traditional Chinese medicine believes that Acorus tatarinowii Rhizoma has a good advantage in the treatment of nervous system diseases, and modern research has also found that the essential oil of Acorus tatarinowii Rhizoma is the main component that plays a neuroprotective role and plays an important role in the treatment of Parkinson's disease. This study aims to explore the effects and mechanisms of essential oil of Acorus tatarinowii Rhizoma (EOAT) on LPS-induced BV2 cell damage and Rotenone-induced Parkinson's disease (PD) rat models. In this experiment, the components of EOAT were identified by GC-MS. LPS was used to induce the overactivation of BV2 microglia, and rotenone was injected subcutaneously to induce Parkinson's disease in rats. Then, the expression of inflammatory factors and IBA-1 in cell was evaluated, and the effects of EOAT treatment were assessed on motor function, inflammatory factors, neurotransmitters, TH, α-Syn, and pathways and inflammation-related mRNA in rats. GC-MS analysis obtained 24 components, among which β-Asarone and α-Asarone had the highest contents. In vitro experiments showed that after 2 h of EOAT intervention, the inflammatory factors TNF-α and IL-6 in the supernatant of LPS-induced BV2 cells were significantly reduced. The IF results showed that after EOAT intervention, the expression of IBA-1 protein in BV2 cells was significantly reduced. In animal experiments, rotenone injection in model rats led to a decrease in motor function, while inhalation of EOAT improved the motor ability of Parkinson's rats. In addition, Madopar and EOAT inhalation increased the levels of BDNF and DA in brain tissue and reduced the levels of IL-Iβ, TNF-α, and IL-6. IHC, IF, and WB analyses showed that the expression of TH protein in brain tissue of the Madopar group and the EOAT group was significantly increased, and the expression level of α-syn was reduced. RT-qPCR results showed that compared with the Model group, the levels of TLR2, MyD88, NF-κB, IL-1β, TNF-α, α-syn, and Bax in the substantia nigra and striatum of the Madopar group and the EOAT group were significantly down-regulated, and the levels of TH and Bcl-2 were significantly up-regulated. These findings suggest that EOAT can prevent LPS from damaging BV2 cells and significantly improve the motor function of PD rats and lessen neuroinflammation. The anti-Parkinson's mechanism of EOAT is primarily dependent on the regulation of the TLR2/MyD88/NF-κB signaling pathway.",,,huyilong20001003@163.com.

Using the GEO database and clinical samples of sepsis, current study revealed that IDO1-AHR-CYP1A1 axis was significantly upregulated and closely related to cytokine storm in septic patients. With cell models of cytokine storm, it was found that IDO1 promoted cytokine storm and the apoptosis of model cells via AHR-CYP1A1, and IDO1-AHR-CYP1A1 axis correlated classic cytokine storm signal pathway including STAT3, NF-κB/STAT1, JNK/p38. With mouse models of septic cytokine storm, it was shown that IDO1 inhibitors could block the upregulated IDO1-AHR-CYP1A1 axis, reduce the enhanced inflammatory cytokine levels, decrease the phosphorylation of classic cytokine storm signal pathway, rescue organ damage, and increase survival rate. It was also found that IDO1 activation occurred after the increase of inflammatory cytokine levels.

Since in vivo testing would involve an excessive number of animals, with consequent ethical and economic issues, the generation of sheep intestinal organoids represents a promising close-to-reality in vitro model for veterinary drug development; however, the characterization and application of such organoids remain limited. In this study, ovine intestinal organoids were generated from adult LGR5+ stem cells from the intestinal crypts of freshly slaughtered lambs, and developed in an in vitro culture system. Morphological analysis via brightfield microscopy and immunocytochemical staining revealed a pseudostratified epithelium with multiple cell types, and distinct apical-basal polarity, while RNA sequencing validated the preservation of the physiological characteristics of the original organ. The development and characterization of a robust and reproducible protocol for culturing sheep duodenum intestinal organoids in a high-throughput screening (HTS) compatible format demonstrated reliability in HTS applications, with Z'-factor tests indicating robust assay performance. Dose-response studies using pre-identified compounds showed comparable pharmacodynamic profiles between mouse and sheep organoids. These findings establish sheep intestinal organoids as an innovative tool for veterinary pharmacology and toxicology, offering a cost-effective and sustainable platform to address challenges such as drug resistance and improve livestock health.",Galli G; Melcón-Fernández E; de Garnica García MG; Martínez-Fernández B; Dehnavi M; Andrés S; Pérez-Pertejo Y; Reguera RM; García-Estrada C; Martínez-Valladares M; Balaña-Fouce R,Departamento de Ciencias Biomédicas; Instituto de Ganadería de Montaña; MicrosVeterinaria,

A total of 144 piglets (Duroc × Landrace × Yorkshire, initial body weight (BW) 6.60 ± 0.35 kg) were randomly assigned to 3 treatments based on BW. The control group was fed a basal diet, while the experimental groups were fed diets supplemented with 8% and 16% extruded corn DDGS for 28 d. The results showed that feeding diets containing extruded corn DDGS had no significant impact on piglet growth performance (P > 0.05). There were no significant differences in the apparent total-tract digestibility (ATTD) of gross energy, day matter, organic matter, and crude protein between the 8% extruded corn DDGS group and the control group (P > 0.05). However, 16% DDGS supplementation reduced the digestibility of these nutrients (P < 0.05). Both the 8% and 16% extruded corn DDGS groups increased the ATTD of ether extract (EE) (P < 0.05). Furthermore, the 8% extruded corn DDGS group increased the malondialdehyde (MDA) content and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity in the liver and jejunum, as well as upregulated total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC) activity and the levels of immune factors such as IL-1β, IL-6, IL-10, and TNF-α in the jejunum (P < 0.05). The expression of tight junction-associated proteins, such as claudin-1, occludin, and ZO-1, was also upregulated in this group (P < 0.05). The 16% DDGS supplementation had no significant effect on these indicators, but it reduced the villus-to-crypt ratio in the jejunum (P < 0.05). Additionally, the inclusion of extruded corn DDGS increased the diversity of microorganisms in colonic digesta, significantly reducing the relative abundance of Lactobacillus and Sharpea, while promoting the enrichment of Turicibacter, norank_f_Erysipelotrichae, unclassified_f_Lachnospiraceae, Ruminococcus, and Marvinbryantia (P < 0.05). Taken together, these results indicate that extruded corn DDGS have no adverse effects on growth performance. The addition of 8% extruded corn DDGS can enhance jejunal immunity and barrier function, increase intestinal microbial diversity, and improve EE digestibility by modulating the structure and composition of the gut microbiota. Therefore, extruded corn DDGS could be considered a feasible ingredient to replace corn and soybean meal in piglet diets, thereby reducing feed costs. Distillers dried grains with solubles (DDGS) are a byproduct of the ethanol industry, rich in fat and protein, and have been widely used in the swine industry as a cost-effective feed ingredient. However, due to its high-fiber content, the bioavailability of its nutrients is often limited. Extrusion technology has been shown to improve the utilization of DDGS. This study aimed to investigate the effects of extruded corn DDGS on the growth performance, nutrient digestibility, intestinal health, and gut microbiota in weaned piglets. The results indicated that substituting corn and soybean meal in the diet with extruded corn DDGS did not adversely affect growth performance. Furthermore, the inclusion of an appropriate level of extruded corn DDGS not only enhanced the immune and barrier functions of the jejunum, but also improved the diversity and composition of the gut microbiota.",,,

Advances in sequencing technology enable clinicians to access the complete genome of bacteria more effectively via whole genome sequencing, thereby providing a solution for the safety evaluation of probiotics. In our current study, seven samples of the Bifidobacterium spp. were isolated from probiotic products, and genomic analysis were used to improve the identification of Bifidobacterium spp. at the species and subspecies levels. Notably, the obtained high-quality complete genomes were employed to predict the genetically encoded drug resistance and virulence attributes of seven Bifidobacterium strains, which further improve the evaluation of probiotics safety. Genes imparting beneficial functional properties, as well as those associated with colonization and survival within the gastrointestinal tract were presented in all strains. In addition, whole genome sequencing-based analysis combined with phylogenetic trees could help identify the subspecies and facilitate the analysis of the existing homology of samples and the previously reported differences between strains.

In this study, two maize inbred lines with differing cold tolerance were treated with exogenous ABA, BR, and their combined solution under cold stress conditions at 10 °C to investigate the effects of these treatments on the physiological characteristics of maize seedlings. The results indicated that cold stress significantly inhibited the growth of maize seedlings. Exogenous hormone treatments enhanced antioxidant enzyme activities and promoted the synthesis of osmolytes, thereby alleviating cold stress; however, the combined treatment (AR) did not significantly improve maize cold tolerance. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that pathways including plant hormone signal transduction, fatty acid elongation, and phenylpropanoid biosynthesis were involved in the interaction between ABA and BR. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) identified four key candidate genes responsive to exogenous ABA and BR under cold stress, namely Zm00001eb343270, Zm00001eb401890, Zm00001eb206790, and Zm00001eb199820. Based on the gene annotation results, we speculate that ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2 O, tubulin-tyrosine ligase-like protein 12, the negative regulator of systemic acquired resistance SNI1, and mRNA stability regulators in response to DNA damage may be involved in regulating maize cold tolerance. These findings provide further evidence for the regulatory mechanisms by which exogenous ABA and BR affect maize cold tolerance and elucidate their interaction under cold stress.",,,

Indigenous children living in the Amazon face several circumstances that can adversely impact their neurodevelopment, including prenatal care, birth conditions, malnutrition, infectious diseases, and socioeconomic challenges. Prenatal exposure to toxic substances configures another determinant influencing neurodevelopment. Exposure to methylmercury is associated with the maternal consumption of contaminated fish. After birth, children continue to undergo exposure by breastfeeding or feeding. This trial aimed to develop a theoretical model to find the determinants of neurodevelopment in the first 1,000 days of life considering prenatal exposure to methylmercury in Indigenous children. The seven steps of the Checklist for Theoretical Report in Epidemiological Studies were followed to elaborate this theoretical model. We offer theoretical-methodological reflections on the dimensions and explanatory variables that highlight how exposure to adverse conditions since intrauterine life worsens in the presence of methylmercury, which can damage human health.

The lack of an efficacious drug for EHP infection has led to the development of a strategy based on the timely screening and elimination of EHP-carrying shrimp seeds as a means of preventing financial loss. This strategy requires portable, accurate and rapid detection methods for EHP, especially when applied to sites such as farms. However, the current lack of user-friendly devices capable of real-time detection under field conditions represents a significant challenge in the implementation of this strategy. In this study, an isothermal amplification nucleic acid biosensor for EHP detection was developed. The biosensor targeted the spore wall protein gene of EHP and amplified the target gene by recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA) combined with strand displacement reaction (SDR). The amplified products were applied on gold nanoparticle-based lateral flow nucleic acid strips (LFNAS) for visual signal conversion. The limit of detection of the SDR-RPA-LFNAS assay was 7 copies reaction-1, and the entire process could be completed in 30 min without cross-reaction. In contrast to existing conventional RPA-related detection methods, the introduction of SDR, which is used to eliminate the background signal produced by long primers, avoids the use of endonucleases and reduces costs. Moreover, the biosensor is straightforward to operate and does not require the use of expensive machinery, rendering it more suitable for the in situ detection of EHP in shrimp farms or aquaculture facilities.",,,

This method provides numerous advantages, such as increased energy efficiency optimization, the possibility of scaling up for industrial use, enhanced drug loading capacity, and safeguarding sensitive compounds designated for encapsulation. Nanoemulsion can be produced simply by combining water, oil, surfactant, and co-surfactant in specific ratios. The sequence in which these components are mixed is generally regarded as non-critical, as nanoemulsions form spontaneously. However, despite the spontaneous nature of nanoemulsification, the forces driving this process are minimal, and the time required for these systems to achieve equilibrium can be considerable. The titration method employed for developing the phase diagram, along with the selection of nanoemulsions from the constructed phase diagram, is crucial for researchers.

This study explored the mechanisms by which NEK2 inhibition affects porcine embryonic development. To explore the role of NEK2 in porcine embryonic development, we used the NEK2 inhibitor JH295 and the AKT activator SC79. Various staining methods, including EdU, EU, OPP, TUNEL assay, real-time PCR, immunocytochemistry, and Western blotting, were used to identify the effects of NEK2 inhibition on developmental competence, DNA damage, and the related mechanisms in porcine embryos. NEK2 inhibition significantly reduced the cleavage rate and blastocyst formation rate. Abnormal development was associated with decreased expression of genes related to zygotic genome activation and significantly reduced the levels of EdU, EU, and OPP. Notably, NEK2 inhibition decreased the levels of p-AKT and AKT, as well as their transcript levels. While NEK2 inhibition reduced the rates of cleavage and blastocyst formation as well as total cell number, all of these effects were reversed by SC79 co-treatment. The proportions of expanded blastocyst and cell survival and the trophectoderm cell numbers were similarly restored to control levels following combined treatment with SC79. Furthermore, the reduced levels of EdU, EU, and OPP by NEK2 inhibition were completely restored by SC79 co-treatment. NEK2 inhibition had a negative impact on DNA integrity, and this effect was inhibited by SC79 co-treatment. Together, these results suggest that NEK2 plays a crucial role in porcine embryonic development by regulating the AKT signaling pathway.",,,spectrum@kribb.re.kr.

Results showed a pronounced synergistic action of EGCG and I3A against diverse food spoilage microorganisms, most notably Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa), with a fractional inhibitory concentration index (FICI) of 0.25. Further research revealed that EGCG disrupted the cell wall and cell membrane of P. aeruginosa, while supplementing I3A significantly boosted the concentration of intracellular reactive oxygen species, thereby inflicting cellular damage. Moreover, the EGCG-I3A treatment inhibited the biofilm formation of P. aeruginosa in a dose-dependent manner, with the effectiveness increasing with the quantity of I3A added. Metabolomic study revealed a perturbation in glutathione and taurine metabolic pathways post synergistic treatment, compromising redox homeostasis. This synergistic treatment also downregulated uracil, proline, and glutamate metabolites, thereby suppressing Quorum Sensing (QS) and biofilm-associated expression within P. aeruginosa.

However, comparing biomarker measures without standardization and appreciating their magnitude relative to the disease can be challenging. To address this issue, we propose the CentiMarker approach, similar to Centiloid, which provides a standardized scale between normal (0) and nearly maximum abnormal AD (100) ranges. We applied this scale to cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers in dominantly inherited AD and sporadic AD cohorts. CentiMarkers facilitated the interpretation of disease abnormality, demonstrating comparable changes and distributions of AD biomarkers across disease stages. CentiMarkers make the treatment effect more comparable than their original scales across various biomarkers. The versatility of CentiMarkers makes it a valuable tool for standardized biomarker comparison in AD research, enabling informed cross-study comparisons and contributing to accelerated therapeutic development. Adoption of the CentiMarker scale could enhance biomarker reporting and advance our understanding of AD.

40233240,Effects of chronic particulate matter exposure on endometriosis-associated signaling pathways and disease progression.,2025-05-08,Molecular human reproduction,10.1093/molehr/gaaf013,"Exposure to PM2.5 (particulate matter <2.5 μm) has been implicated in increasing the risk of endometriosis and worsening its symptoms. However, the molecular mechanisms and direct associations remain unclear. This study explored whether PM2.5 contributes to the onset or progression of endometriosis using in vitro and in vivo models. Endometrial (EM) cells from women without endometriosis were cultured to the second passages (P2) with or without exposure to PM2.5 at a concentration of 200 µg/ml (N = 5 for each group). Z-stack confocal imaging confirmed PM accumulation in the nucleus and cytoplasm of exposed EM cells. Initial PM exposure at the primary passage (P0) led to decreased proliferation, migration, anti-apoptosis, and oxidative stress, accompanied by downregulation of associated pathways. However, repeated PM exposure during subculturing to P2 led to increased proliferation, enhanced anti-apoptotic activity, and elevated oxidative stress. Given the similarity of these gene expression alterations to those observed in endometriosis, an endometriosis-induced mouse model was established to assess the potential of repeated PM exposure to exacerbate the condition in vivo. To investigate the in vivo effects, an endometriosis-induced mouse model was developed using female C57BL/6 mice exposed to low (10 mg/kg/day) or high (20 mg/kg/day) doses of PM2.5 for 4 weeks (n = 6 for each group). PM exposure significantly enlarged endometriotic lesions compared to controls (no PM exposure). Upregulated gene expression in endometriotic lesions included anti-apoptotic (Bcl2/Bax), proliferative (p-ERK), inflammatory (p-NF-κB, p-c-jun, IL-6, IL-1β), and migration (MMP-2, MMP-9) markers. PM exposure altered estrogen receptor (ER) expression, resulting in a decreased ERα/ERβ ratio in both dose groups. The control group exhibited a ratio of 1.03 ± 0.09, while the low-dose and high-dose mice had ratios of 0.57 ± 0.08 (P = 0.02) and 0.46 ± 0.26 (P = 0.03), respectively. In conclusion, PM2.5 exposure alters gene expression related to cell growth, survival, oxidative stress, and migration in EM cells and exacerbates endometriotic lesions in vivo, likely through ER modulation. These findings suggest PM2.5 may contribute to other estrogen-dependent conditions, such as leiomyoma or adenomyosis, by influencing ER pathways.",,,

However, its neuropathological features can be objectively quantified using electroencephalography (EEG). Despite the existing research, the pathophysiology of tinnitus remains unclear. The objective of this study was to gain a deeper comprehension of the neural mechanisms underlying tinnitus through the comparison of cognitive event-related potentials in patients with tinnitus and healthy controls (HCs). Furthermore, we explored the potential of EEG-derived features as biomarkers for tinnitus using machine learning techniques. Forty-eight participants (24 patients with tinnitus and 24 HCs) underwent comprehensive audiological assessments and EEG recordings. We extracted N2 and P3 components of the midline electrodes using an auditory oddball paradigm, to explore the relationship between tinnitus and cognitive function. In addition, the current source density for N2- and P3-related regions of interest was computed. A linear support vector machine classifier was used to distinguish patients with tinnitus from HCs. The P3 peak amplitudes were significantly diminished in patients with tinnitus at the AFz, Fz, Cz, and Pz electrodes, whereas the N2 peak latencies were significantly delayed at Cz electrode. Source analysis revealed notably reduced N2 activities in bilateral fusiform gyrus, bilateral cuneus, bilateral temporal gyrus, and bilateral insula of patients with tinnitus. Correlation analysis revealed significant associations between the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale-Depression scores and N2 source activities at left insula, right insula, and left inferior temporal gyrus. The best classification performance showed a validation accuracy of 85.42%, validation sensitivity of 87.50%, and validation specificity of 83.33% in distinguishing between patients with tinnitus and HCs by using a total of 18 features in both sensor- and source-level. This study demonstrated that patients with tinnitus exhibited significantly altered neural processing during the cognitive-related oddball paradigm, including lower P3 amplitudes, delayed N2 latency, and reduced source activities in specific brain regions in cognitive-related oddball paradigm. The correlations between N2 source activities and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale-Depression scores suggest a potential link between the physiological symptoms of tinnitus and their neural impact on patients with tinnitus. Such findings underscore the potential diagnostic relevance of N2- and P3-related features in tinnitus, while also highlighting the interplay between the temporal lobe and occipital lobe in tinnitus. Furthermore, the application of machine learning techniques has shown reliable results in distinguishing tinnitus patients from HCs, reinforcing the viability of N2 and P3 features as biomarkers for tinnitus.",,,

A new class of DESs, known as natural deep eutectic solvents (NADESs), is derived from natural chemicals and is expected to be more environmentally friendly. However, research into the environmental impact and toxicity of NADESs is still limited. Given the broad applications of DESs and the urgent need for sustainable alternatives, studying their toxicity is crucial. In our current study, we focused on NADESs formulated from menthol, thymol, and amino acid. We assessed their toxicity on different cell lines using standard biochemical assays. Remarkably, our findings also indicate that these NADESs exhibit low toxicity in the HaCaT cell line and a mice blood sample. We also found that all of the tested NADESs have shown better antimicrobial property values compared to the individual components of NADESs, indicating the importance of NADES formulation for applications.

Despite significant advances, several critical challenges remain before their full potential can be realized. This article examines key obstacles facing MPS adoption and implementation while proposing actionable solu-tions to accelerate their development and acceptance. Major challenges include standardization issues across terminology and protocols, validation complexities requiring robust reference com-pounds and benchmarking standards, regulatory uncertainties regarding data requirements and qualification processes, and barriers to effective data sharing among stakeholders. The paper traces the field's evolution through various international initiatives, particularly highlighting the Center for Alternatives to Animal Testing's (CAAT) contributions, including the establishment of the International MPS Society and World Summits. Proposed solutions emphasize establishing global standards through international consortia, enhancing validation frameworks through specialized validation centers, fostering collaboration through pre-competitive consortia and standardized data formats, and advancing regulatory integration through detailed case studies and clear guidance documents. Future priorities focus on overcoming technical challenges in biological complexity, addressing engineering hurdles, standardizing technologies, improving data management, increasing eco-nomic accessibility, and integrating with other emerging technologies. The path forward requires coordinated, collaborative efforts across academia, industry, regulatory agencies, and technology suppliers to systematically address these interrelated challenges. Microphysiological systems (MPS) are advanced laboratory models that mimic human organs using engineered tissues and microfluidic technology. These “organs-on-chips” and 3D orga­noids allow scientists to study disease and test drugs without using animals. Despite their promise, MPS face several challenges that slow their widespread adoption. These include inconsistent standards, difficulties proving they work reliably, regulatory uncertainties, and limited data sharing between organizations. This paper identifies these obstacles and proposes practical solu­tions: creating international standards, establishing dedicated centers to validate MPS models, encouraging organizations to share data, and developing clear regulatory pathways. The authors highlight ongoing collaborative efforts, including international conferences and societies dedicated to advancing MPS technologies.

High concentrations of these compounds secreted in the tissue culture medium can lead to its darkening and the eventual death of explants in in vitro cultures. This study aims to enhance the morphogenesis of F. tataricum callus cultures by utilising phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL) inhibitors and polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) to mitigate oxidative browning and improve tissue viability. We analysed the response of protoplasts isolated from morphogenic callus to media supplemented with varying concentrations of PAL inhibitors (AIP, AOPP, OBHA) and PVP. The flow cytometry results revealed that 10 µM AIP and 1% PVP yielded exclusively diploid plants, whereas higher concentrations (100 µM AIP and 3% PVP) failed to regenerate plants. Moreover, AOPP and OBHA addition resulted in the regeneration of tetraploid plants. Further analysis of proembryogenic cell complexes (PECCs) isolated from Tartary buckwheat morphogenic calli responses to AIP and PVP indicated that 100 µM AIP was most effective for plant regeneration. Metabolomic analysis showed that AIP treatments reduced phenolic compounds, notably rutin, and increased the GSH/GSSG ratio, indicating reduced oxidative stress. Gene expression analysis highlighted elevated expression of somatic embryogenesis-related genes (LEC2, BBM) and WUSCHEL in AIP-treated callus. This study demonstrates that AIP enhances the regeneration potential of F. tataricum callus cultures, offering valuable insights for optimising tissue culture techniques for industrial crops.

Recent decisions, particularly the ban on nearly all antibiotic feed additives utilized as growth promoters, have resulted in a decrease in their usage. Nonetheless, their essential role in therapy and their economic value are indisputable. This study evaluated the presence of antibiotic residues in marketed turkey meat using the four-box method. The analyses indicated that, of the 400 samples examined, the overall prevalence of contamination was 65.75%. Among the different types of antibiotics identified in the samples, β-lactam/tetracycline residues were the highest, with a prevalence of 41.44%. The analysis of different sample types revealed significant contamination rates in turkey organs, particularly the liver, with a contamination prevalence of approximately 83.75%, and the wing muscle, 78.75%. Two antibiotic families, β-lactam and tetracycline, were identified in the wing muscle and liver at frequencies of 44.44% and 43.28%, respectively. Regarding cross-contamination, positive samples exhibited contamination concurrently by a specific type of residue, with a notable rate of 58.19%. All analyzed organs exhibited contamination by multiple residue types, with varying contaminants present in different organs. The findings indicated varying detection rates of antibiotic residues in consumed turkey meat. These highlight the excessive use of antibiotics in the poultry industry, increasing consumer exposure to these residues'associated risks. Therefore, it is essential to implement stricter measures and monitoring systems regarding the use of antibiotics in poultry farming.",,,hassna.jaber@uit.ac.ma.

These chemicals, including legacy compounds such as polybrominated diphenyl ethers and newer organophosphate flame retardant, exhibit endocrine-disrupting properties that interfere with hormonal pathways, neurotransmission, and synaptic plasticity. Epidemiological studies have linked flame retardant exposure to adverse developmental outcomes, including anxiety and cognitive deficits. Mechanistic research reveals that flame retardants disrupt neurogenesis, synaptogenesis, and neurotransmitter pathways, often mediated through oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and nuclear receptor modulation. Animal studies corroborate these findings, showing impaired spatial memory, altered anxiety-like behaviors, and disrupted neurochemical homeostasis following perinatal and postnatal exposure to flame retardants. Emerging organophosphate flame retardants, such as bis(2-ethylhexyl) phenyl phosphate, demonstrate comparable or increased toxicity, further emphasizing the need for regulatory scrutiny and safer alternatives. This review synthesizes current knowledge on the neurotoxic mechanisms of flame retardants, highlighting their impact on anxiety and cognition across developmental stages.

Here, a biomimetic tracheal graft (BTG) is developed through a hybrid process of 3D printing and electrospinning using polycaprolactone (PCL)polymer. First, a flexible PCL tracheal frame with a high rotation angle is prepared using 3D printing. Second, PCL nanofibers for mucosal reconstruction are placed inside the lumen, and PCL microfibers are placed on the outside of the frame to promote blood vessel formation. Air-liquid interface cultures of human bronchial epithelial cells on the nanofibers demonstrated the generation of epithelium, goblet cells, and ciliated cells after 14 days. Chondrocyte cultures and co-cultures of chondrocytes and human umbilical vein endothelial cells confirmed higher cell attachment and survival on the BTG than on the conventional tracheal graft (CTG).

High-content screening (HCS) can quantify cellular and organelle morphological changes through image analysis; however, most HCS studies on apoptosis, a key toxicological event, have focused on the expression of apoptosis-related genes or proteins. In this study, we aimed to verify whether apoptosis can be detected solely based on cellular morphological changes. Chang cells were treated with staurosporine (STS), a well-known apoptosis inducer, and the morphological changes in the cells were quantified using HCS assays. The correlation between these HCS morphological descriptors and apoptosis rates measured using flow cytometry was determined. Chang cells were also treated with several plant-derived alkaloids known to induce apoptosis, and the same process was performed. The correlation coefficients, which were used to evaluate the correlation between HCS descriptors and apoptosis rates after STS treatment, ranged from 0.64 to 0.98, with 13 descriptors showing significant correlations. In contrast, the highest correlation coefficients between HCS descriptors and apoptosis rates after treatment with 1 of the 12 alkaloids investigated were determined to be 0.75 (at 10 μg/ml) and 0.49 (at 100 μg/ml). The apoptosis-related morphological changes induced by STS and alkaloids were observed using confocal microscopy.

In invertebrates, the monoamine, octopamine (OA), has a similar role to that of noradrenaline in mammals. Beta-2 adrenergic agonists increase protein and decrease fat deposition in mammals, thereby inducing favourable changes in body composition. We hypothesised that OA would have similar effects in insects. Tenebrio molitor larvae, commonly called yellow mealworms, were fed for 35 days on either control wheat bran or wheat bran containing OA at 5 μg OA/g. There were trends for treatment × time interactions for mealworm group weight (P = 0.075) and individual mealworm weight (P = 0.069), with the OA group becoming heavier/bigger after 18 days. In addition, there was a trend for a treatment × time interaction on cumulative pupation (P = 0.099), with OA-treated mealworms having delayed pupation. After 35 days of OA treatment, there were significant effects on mealworm final body proximate nutrient composition on a DM basis, with fat content being significantly decreased (by 8%, P = 0.006), whilst CP was significantly increased (by 6%, P = 0.019) in OA-treated mealworms compared to control. There was little effect of OA on the fatty acid composition of the mealworms, with small reductions in palmitoleic acid (P < 0.001) and oleic acid (P = 0.082). Despite a significant increase in protein content with OA treatment, SDS-PAGE did not reveal any changes in the proteins being expressed. Hence, OA treatment of mealworms resulted in an increase in the proportion of protein and a decrease in fat, demonstrating that mealworm nutrient composition can potentially be manipulated to provide a higher-value feed ingredient.",,,tim.parr@nottingham.ac.uk.

Non-thermal plasma seed treatment offers a promising alternative by enhancing germination, nutrient uptake, and disease resistance, and reducing reliance on pesticides and fertilizers. There is an urgent need to transform agricultural practices to meet the challenges of sustainable food production amidst global population growth and environmental degradation. Traditional crop production methods heavily rely on pesticides and synthetic fertilizers, which pose significant risks to human health, disrupt ecosystems, and contribute to environmental pollution. Moreover, these methods are increasingly unsustainable due to rising costs and diminishing effectiveness, evolving pest resistance, and climate change impacts. Recently, non-thermal plasma (NTP) technology has emerged as a promising alternative for seed treatment in agriculture. NTP uses low-temperature plasma to modify seed surfaces, enhancing germination, vigor, and overall plant growth. Studies have demonstrated that NTP treatment improves nutrient uptake, increases disease resistance, and reduces the reliance on chemical inputs (pesticides and fertilizers), thereby promoting pesticide and chemical fertilizer-free agriculture. This paper explores recent research advancements in NTP seed treatment and its potential applications in sustainable agriculture.

40221757,Assembly of MSCs into a spheroid configuration increases poly(I:C)-mediated TLR3 activation and the immunomodulatory potential of MSCs for alleviating murine colitis.,2025-04-12,Stem cell research & therapy,10.1186/s13287-025-04297-3,"Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is associated with significant clinical challenges due to the limitations of current therapeutic approaches. Mesenchymal stem cell (MSC)-based therapies have shown promise in alleviating IBD owing to their potent immunomodulatory properties. However, the therapeutic efficacy of these cells remains suboptimal, primarily due to the harsh peritoneal microenvironment, which compromises MSC viability and functional capacity after transplantation. To address these limitations, this study aimed to improve MSC engraftment and functionality by assembling MSCs into three-dimensional (3D) spheroids and priming them with the Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) agonist polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (poly(I:C)). Their potential for treating IBD was evaluated using male C57BL/6 mice with dextran sulfate sodium-induced colitis. While 3D spheroid formation alone upregulated TLR3 expression and increased MSC survival under oxidative stress, poly(I:C) priming had a pronounced synergistic effect, significantly increasing MSC-mediated splenocyte modulation and oxidative stress resistance. In a murine colitis model, compared with unprimed spheroids or MSC suspensions, poly(I:C)-primed MSC spheroids administered intraperitoneally exhibited increased survival and therapeutic efficacy, effectively alleviating colitis symptoms, reducing colonic inflammation, and promoting tissue recovery. Collectively, these findings highlight the synergistic benefits of combining 3D spheroid assembly with TLR3 activation as an innovative strategy to improve the therapeutic efficacy of MSC-based treatments for IBD and other inflammatory diseases by increasing post-engraftment cell survival and immunomodulatory capacity.",,,tshsu@life.nthu.edu.tw.
40221685,"Virulence genes and antibiotic resistance profiling of staphylococcus species isolated from mastitic dairy cows in and around Bahir dar, Ethiopia.",2025-04-12,BMC microbiology,10.1186/s12866-025-03886-9,"Mastitis is one of the primary causes of economic and production losses in the dairy cattle industry. Bacterial infections are the most significant contributors to bovine mastitis, with Staphylococcus species among the most prevalent and challenging pathogens. This issue is especially severe in low- and middle-income countries, including Ethiopia, where a comprehensive understanding of Staphylococcus species in clinical and subclinical mastitis remains poorly understood. This is particularly true in the regions surrounding Bahir Dar, where comprehensive data on the genetic determinants of virulence and resistance in Staphylococcus species causing bovine mastitis are notably lacking. The lack of such molecular insights hampers the development of targeted therapeutic and preventive strategies for managing mastitis in the region. Therefore, the present study aimed to investigate the virulence gene profiles and antimicrobial resistance (AMR) patterns of Staphylococcus species isolated from mastitic dairy cows in and around Bahir Dar, Ethiopia. A cross-sectional study was conducted from March 2023 to December 2023 to investigate the molecular characteristics of Staphylococcus species and their antimicrobial resistance profiles in dairy cows with mastitis. A total of 150 lactating cows from 21 farms were included in the study, with 600 milk samples collected from the four-quarters of each cow. The samples were screened via the California mastitis test and physical examination. Staphylococcus species isolates were identified and single-plex PCR was used to detect virulence genes. The antimicrobial resistance profile of the isolates was determined via the Kary-Bauer disk diffusion method. The overall quarter-level mastitis incidence was 19.83% (119/600). Among 119 mastitis-positive samples, 80 samples were bacteriologically confirmed to harbor Staphylococcus species with eight different Staphylococcus species, of which Staphylococcus chromogenes was the most prevalent isolate (19%), followed by S. aureus, S. hyicus and S. epidermidis (15%), S. hemolyticus (11%), S. simulans and S. xylosus (10%), and S. intermedius (5%). Seven distinct virulence genes were identified with varying frequencies: Coa (35%), seb (33.33%), mecA (31.67%), icaD (31.67%), Hla (20%), Hlb (10%), and sea (8.3%). The icaD and seb genes were observed in all 8 species with respective percentages (S. hemolyticus (62.5, 37.5), S. aureus (44.44, 55.55), S. hyicus (44.44, 44.44), S. epidermidis 2 (22.22, 44.44), chromogenes (9.1, 9.1), S. intermidius (33.33, 33.33), S. simulance (16.67, 16.67) and S. xylosus (16.67, 16.67). Both the Hla and Hlb genes were detected in the same three distinct species, with percentages of S. aureus (44.44; 22.22%), S. hemolyticus (42.5; 25%) and S. hyicus (55.55; 22.22). S. aureus exhibited the highest proportion of mecA-positive isolates, with 6 out of 9 isolates (66.67%) carrying the gene. All the isolated Staphylococcus species were 100% resistant to penicillin, and except for S. chromogenes and S. xylosus, the remaining 6 species of Staphylococcus also exhibited 100% resistance to tetracycline. Among all MDR isolates, 6/9 (66.7%) S. aureus, (5/8; 62.5%) S. hemolyticus, and (6/9; 66.7%) S. hyicus were resistant to up to seven classes of antibiotics. A lower frequency of MDR isolates was detected among S. simulans and S. xylosus (both at 2/6; 33.33%), resistant to up to five antibiotics. Among the identified Staphylococcus species, S. chromogenes emerged as the dominant isolate. All eight isolated species harbored two or more virulence genes, with nearly one-third of the isolates carrying the mecA gene, underscoring their pathogenic potential in causing bovine mastitis. Furthermore, all the Staphylococcus isolates in this study were resistant to penicillin and were multidrug resistant.",,,dessievet@gmail.com.

Since traditional vaccine strategies cannot provide complete protection for piglets, the development of safe, effective, and economical antiviral drugs is urgently needed. For many years, traditional Chinese medicines (TCMs) have been broadly applied for viral infectious diseases, exhibiting advantages such as abundant resources, lower toxicity, and minimal drug resistance. Many Chinese herbal monomers, single herbal extracts derived from these traditional drugs, and Chinese herbal recipes exhibit significant anti-PEDV effects in vitro and/or in vivo by targeting multiple sites and perspectives, including inhibition of the viral life cycle, anti-inflammation effects, enhancement of the host immune response, modulation of reactive oxygen species, and apoptosis. However, to date, no review has been published on the anti-PEDV effects of TCM. Therefore, this review summarizes the current control strategies for PEDV and systematically analyses the research progress of TCMs against PEDV.

Thus, the aims of this study include monitoring the aerobic plate count (APC), the prevalence, and the characterisations (antimicrobial resistance, aerotolerance, aerobic growth, and plasmid profiling) of Campylobacter spp.. This study sampled 260 chicken thighs and drumsticks from retail supermarkets and wet markets in Selangor, Malaysia. Prevalence and microbial loads of Campylobacter spp. were assessed with the most probable number-polymerase chain reaction (MPN-PCR). Antibiotic resistance assay was conducted with disk diffusion assay with 12 types of antibiotics. Prevalence surveillance indicated that 68.9 % of Campylobacter spp., 47.7 % of C. jejuni, and 40.0 % of C. coli were detected. Co-contamination prevalence of C. jejuni and C. coli (28.46 %) occurred significantly higher than mono-contaminations, 19.62 % in C. jejuni and 11.54 % in C. coli, respectively.

However, the effectiveness of natural antimicrobial agents as substitutes for chemical preservatives, as well as the underlying microbial mechanisms of their broad-spectrum antibacterial activity, remain unclear. Here, the performance of Syzygium aromaticum and Myristica fragrans extracts in food preservation and the underlying antimicrobial mechanisms were evaluated in comparison with the chemical preservative sodium benzoate. Using strawberry as a representative example, the results showed that S. aromaticum extract had superior preservation efficacy to both M. fragrans extract and sodium benzoate. S. aromaticum extract inhibits spoilage by significantly promoting the proliferation of beneficial microorganisms, which form a protective film on fruit surface, thereby reducing the attachment of spoilage and pathogenic bacteria. This study offers a novel microbiological rationale for using S. aromaticum as a natural alternative to chemical preservatives, enhancing safety and quality of perishable fruits.",,,yaozhl@th.btbu.edu.cn.

However, its underlying molecular mechanisms in treating depression still need further exploration. In this study, we investigated whether FBD could prevent depressive-like behaviors by remodeling the microglial state transition via the inhibition of SIRT1/HMGB1 signaling in vivo and in vitro. In vivo, adult male C57BL/6 J mice were subjected to chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) for 6 weeks to investigate whether FBD could produce antidepressant-like behavioral effects. At 9 weeks of age, EX527, a SIRT1 inhibitor, was injected intraperitoneally 30 min before the intragastric administration of FBD, Flx or vehicle daily until 12 weeks of age, and the effects of alterations in SIRT1/HMGB1 signaling on CUMS-mediated depression were investigated. In vitro, the anti-depressive mechanism of FBD was further investigated using BV-2 cells (a microglial cell line) and primary PFC neurons. We examined depression-like behaviors using behavioral tests. Serum and supernatants samples were collected and interleukin-1β (IL-1β), IL-6 and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) levels were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs). Prefrontal cortical (PFC) tissues, BV-2 cells and PFC neurons were collected to detect neuronal apoptosis, the microglial state or proteins in the silent information regulator 2 homolog 1 (SIRT1)/high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) signaling pathway via flow cytometry, immunohistochemical staining, immunofluorescence staining,TUNEL staining or western blot analysis. The administration of FBD ameliorated the depressive-like behaviors induced by CUMS. In addition, FBD supplementation promoted the transition from a proinflammatory microglial phenotype to an anti-inflammatory microglial phenotype. The FBD-mediated inhibition of HMGB1 expression and its nucleocytoplasmic translocation were identified as likely due to increased SIRT1 activity, effectively inhibiting the subsequent inflammatory response. Furthermore, our findings revealed that FBD notably attenuated neuronal apoptosis in the PFC. In contrast, the SIRT1 inhibitor EX527 counteracted the antidepressant effect of FBD while also reversing the expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), NeuN, cleaved caspase-3, bax, and bcl-2 proteins. This study showed that FBD prevents depression by mediating a microglial state transition via the SIRT1/HMGB1 signaling pathway, providing a promising and novel antidepressant therapeutic strategy.",,,miaomingsan@hactcm.edu.cn.

They are naturally exposed to a combination of interacting stressors, e.g., loss of flowering resources and exposure to plant protection products. Mass-flowering crops are important resources for bees, but they may result in unbalanced nutrition due to different nutritional values. In this study, a semi-field experiment was conducted to evaluate the response of Bombus terrestris colonies after the application of a tank mixture containing the insecticide chlorantraniliprole and the fungicide prochloraz, either in monofloral-managed lupin (Lupinus albus) as high pollen protein resource or in presence of an additional polyfloral flower mixture. Our results demonstrate an evident effect on worker mortality after application of the tank mixture. Higher worker mortality in polyfloral treatments compared to the untreated control was observed. The number of young brood and pupae in colonies in polyfloral control were significantly higher than in monofloral treatment. However, no long-term effects on the number or weight of new queens were found. Furthermore, flowering resources, but not pesticide exposure, affected colony weight. Exposure to the tank mixture resulted in declining nectar yeasts abundance and an increasing proportion of phylloplane yeasts in forager guts. In conclusion, diverse flowering resources are important for a bumble bee colony's development. Even in a high pollen protein crop, low flower diversity may act as an additional stressor. Thus, we suggest further maintaining and promoting flowering strips or flowering fields in agricultural landscapes, even near high pollen protein crops, to enhance bee health.",Steinert M,Technische Universität Braunschweig,abdulrahim.alkassab@julius-kuehn.de.

The hope with CIVM/MPS is that they will eventually improve our predictivity for clinical responses and reduce or replace animal use in research, supporting the 3Rs concept of only using animals in research when necessary. Given the potential of animal-based models to advance this field by comparing existing in vivo animal data with new animal-based MPS responses, there are currently few CIVM and MPS utilizing animal tissues. Animal-based MPS may also have specific utility for cross-species comparisons or species-specific mechanistic questions on zoonotic diseases, and therapies for animals.

Typically, only 3 to 5 animals are allocated per group, based on historical conventions or industry practice, particularly in early toxicology studies with several different types of controls and compounds at various concentrations. When we estimate means, variances, or other parameters under these conditions, often the confidence intervals generated will be of little practical use due to the small sample size. If, however, historical or even concurrent data with similar characteristics is available from comparable experiments, all data could be incorporated into the estimation by using an Empirical Bayesian approach. To implement this method, the existing data is used to determine prior distributions for the parameters of interest, which are then combined with the sample data of interest to produce posterior distributions. In our case study, we combined data from 30 different experiments to use as a basis for defining the prior distributions on the mean and standard deviation (SD). For practical reasons related to our application, we prefer to use the standard deviation instead of the variance or precision that are more commonly used in the Bayesian methodology. For the mean parameter, the prior distribution is approximated by a Normal distribution, covering the range of all samples. For SD, the prior distribution is approximated with a half-Normal, half-Cauchy, or Uniform with carefully chosen boundaries. An Empirical Bayes method is then applied, combining the selected prior distributions with observed data in each small experiment to obtain the posterior distribution for the mean and for the variance of that particular experiment. The strategy of using the combined data from multiple samples to develop a common prior distribution that borrows strength across all the available data reduces the variability of the estimates and improves the estimation of individual parameters. In effect, this method combines ""borrowing strength"" with ""Empirical Bayes"" in a way that suggests ""Tukey meets Robbins""!",Tatikola K; Geys H; Tekle F; Sendecki J; Altan S; Amaratunga D,Department of Biostatistics; Translational Medicine and Early Development Statistics,

However, the pharmacodynamic material basis of DBD in DKD therapy remains unclear, hindering its industrial development and innovation in drug formulations. Lipid metabolism disorder is a key pathological mechanism in DKD progression. This study employs lipidomics to elucidate and validate the pharmacodynamic material basis of DBD in treating DKD. Forty-eight male SD rats were used in the experiment, with 8 rats per group. The DKD model was constructed with a diet high in fat and sugar, together with intraperitoneal administration of low-dose STZ and unilateral nephrectomy. DBD was administered continuously for 10 weeks to assess its therapeutic efficacy on DKD. Lipid biomarkers in the DKD models were analyzed using lipidomics, while the transitional components in the blood of DBD-treated rats were characterized through UPLC-QE-Orbitrap MS. Potential pharmacodynamic substances were identified by correlating lipid biomarkers with active ingredients in vivo, followed by molecular docking and in vitro experiments to validate key pharmacodynamic components. DBD significantly improved blood glucose, blood lipid levels, and renal function in DKD model rats. Lipidomics identified 37 lipid biomarkers in the DKD models, and DBD demonstrated a marked corrective effect on these biomarkers. In the therapeutically effective state, 91 blood transitional components of DBD were identified. Correlation analysis revealed 44 pharmacodynamic substances associated with DKD treatment, with ferulic acid, calycosin, astragaloside IV, and ligustilide being the key components. These substances acted by increasing the levels of SIRT1, PPARG, and ABCA1 proteins in lipid-deposited podocytes. In conclusion, this study explained the scientific connotation of DBD treatment of DKD with modern scientific language from three aspects: pharmacodynamic evaluation, pharmacodynamic material basis and mechanism of action from the perspective of lipid metabolism balance for the first time, and provided an empirical basis for the modern application of traditional Chinese medicinal prescriptions.",,,wxh8088@163.com.

There is an urgent need for effective therapeutic and prophylactic treatments, especially those that can overcome the limitations associated with vaccines and antibiotics. This includes the development of novel antitoxin agents, immunomodulatory therapies, and alternative strategies like phage therapy and herbal extracts. Our previous study has demonstrated membrane protein caveolin-1 (CAV1) is a key protein that acts as a functional receptor of APP ApxI toxin by binding to its acylated region. Here, we developed recombinant human N-CAV1-Fc fusion protein and C-CAV1-Fc fusion protein. Both fusion proteins could tightly bind to ApxI toxin. N-CAV1-Fc and C-CAV1-Fc fusion proteins efficiently blocked the interaction between ApxI toxin and immortalized porcine alveolar macrophages (iPAMs), thereby inhibiting cell apoptosis caused by APP ApxI toxin. Furthermore, prophylactic and therapeutic CAV1-Fc treatments effectively protected mice from ApxI toxin-induced damage, as determined by reduced weight loss, apoptosis factor transcription, and pathological changes in the lungs. The protective effects of N-CAV1-Fc and C-CAV1-Fc showed clear dose-dependent efficacy in vivo. Protein kinetics data indicated that N-CAV1-Fc has a relatively longer half-life in vivo compared to C-CAV1-Fc, making it an excellent candidate for prevention and treatment of APP infections.",,,wentao@mail.hzau.edu.cn.

Among the various types of infertility, non-obstructive azoospermia (NOA) is the most severe and is closely associated with exposure to environmental toxins. The molecular mechanisms by which 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD), a typical persistent organic pollutant, induces NOA have yet to be systematically elucidated. This study employed the single-sample Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (ssGSEA) method to identify key toxicological pathways and constructed a diagnostic model based on 113 machine learning algorithms. By integrating Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis (WGCNA) and single-cell analysis, we identified hub genes associated with the Sertoli Cell-Only Syndrome (SCOS) subtype. Finally, biomolecular modeling was conducted to validate the binding efficacy of the hub genes with TCDD. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analysis based on the ssGSEA method indicated that TCDD may disrupt spermatogenesis by activating the Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF) and Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways while inhibiting the Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) signaling pathway, ultimately leading to NOA. Through the integration of machine learning techniques, 5 hub genes (AUC > 0.7) induced by TCDD and associated with NOA were identified: Androgen receptor (AR), Chromodomain Helicase DNA-Binding Protein 1 (CHD1), Discoidin Domain Receptor Tyrosine Kinase 2 (DDR2), Retinoic Acid Receptor-Related Orphan Receptor Alpha (RORA), and Glutamate Ionotropic Receptor AMPA Type Subunit 1 (GRIA1). WGCNA and single-cell analysis revealed that AR and DDR2 were specifically expressed in the testicular tissues of NOA patients and were closely associated with SCOS (p < 0.05). Immune infiltration analysis suggested that TCDD induces abnormal infiltration of various immune cells, indicating its close relationship with immune inflammatory responses (p < 0.05).

The particle size, and zeta potential revealed that the mean particle size of RONs decreased with the rising of ultrasonic power when RONs were freshly prepared. RONs had storage stability for at least 30 days, and the particle size variations of RON-65w and RON-97.5w were smaller than other RONs. Time-killing assay, minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), and growth curve analysis revealed that RONs exhibited higher antibacterial activities against Escherichia coli than rose oil (RO). Scanning electron microscopy and bacterial membrane integrity analysis revealed that RO and RONs exerted their antibacterial effect by increasing the permeability of bacterial cells, and the leakage of nucleic acids and protein caused by RONs were higher than RO (p < 0.05). Compared with MIC assay, RON-65w and RON-97.5w exhibited significantly higher antibacterial activities than other RONs in growth curve analysis, and RON-65w led to highest leakage of nucleic acids and protein among all RONs in bacterial membrane integrity analysis (p < 0.05). Thus, the effect of ultrasonic power on antibacterial activity of RONs was more obvious under agitated conditions than static experimental conditions. The results of application experiment indicated that RON-97.5w displayed greater inhibition ability against E.coli than RO in cucumber juice.

Bacteria were isolated from air samples and evaluated for their plant growth-promoting (PGPB) and antifungal properties as biocontrol of phytopathogens. Results showed that diverse bacterial species, including Exiguobacterium, Rhodococcus, Kocuria, and Staphylococcus genera, exhibited PGPB activities such as phosphorus solubilization, siderophore production, and auxin production. Kocuria strains showed high auxin production. Rhodococcus sp. was observed to significantly promote root growth and the formation of beneficial biofilms on bean roots. Additionally, this bacterium opened the xylem vessels, facilitating the absorption of nutrients and water. Kocuria sp. strains exhibited high antifungal activity against Fusarium oxysporum and Phytophthora cinnamomi due to volatile organic compounds (VOCs) produced by these strains.

As most studies on clinical trial costs and durations have primarily focused on pharmaceutical companies developing drugs in the USA, understanding actual trial costs and durations for Japanese pharmaceutical companies engaged in global development or development within their own countries remains challenging. This study aimed to clarify the actual phase-specific costs and durations of clinical trials conducted by leading Japanese pharmaceutical companies and to identify the factors influencing these parameters. We conducted a questionnaire-based survey among 22 pharmaceutical companies headquartered in Japan. Respondents from each company retrospectively identified clinical trials for new drug applications or for expanding approved disease indications, conducted between 2012 and 2022, providing cost and duration data of each clinical trial. We calculated summary statistics for costs and durations by phase and conducted an exploratory analysis of the variables influencing these parameters. In total, 631 projects with clinical trials conducted by these companies were analyzed. The median costs in the analysis population were 859 million Japanese yen (JPY) for Phase 1, 1,739 million JPY for Phase 2, and 4,183 million JPY for Phase 3. For reference, the median annual average exchange rates during the study period were 109 JPY per US dollar (USD) and 130 JPY per euro (EUR). The median durations were 20 months for Phase 1, 29 months for Phase 2, and 31 months for Phase 3. For projects targeting approval only in Japan, the median Phase 3 cost was 3,050 million JPY, while for projects targeting approval involving the USA or Europe, it was 8,083 million JPY. This study quantifies the costs and durations incurred by Japanese pharmaceutical companies in conducting clinical trials, revealing the high costs associated with projects targeting approval involving the USA or Europe.

In this study, salmon skin collagen nanofiber membrane (GS) was prepared by electrostatic spinning. Then, skin collagen was combined with silk sericin (SS) and sodium hyaluronate (HA) to fabricate composite collagen nanofiber membrane (GF) using electrostatic spinning technology. GF membranes were further cross-linked (GFL) for use in a mouse wound healing model. The physicochemical properties and biocompatibility of GS, GF, and GFL were evaluated. FTIR analysis revealed that GFL exhibited a more stable secondary structure compared to GS and GF. DSC and TGA results indicated that GFL had the highest thermal stability, followed by GF. Cytotoxicity tests confirmed that GS, GF, and GFL were non-cytotoxic, with GF showing the highest cell viability rate of 175.23 ± 1.77%. In the wound healing model, GFL group achieved nearly complete healing by day 14 (98 ± 0.1%), compared to 76.04 ± 0.01% in the blank group. Measurement of TGF-β1 and VEGF levels in the healing tissue on day 14 indicated that the GFL group had progressed to the late stage of healing, whereas the blank group remained in the early stage.

40214286,Improving Multispecific Antibody Bioprocesses Through Coculture and Column-Based Redox Reactions: Part II.,,Biotechnology and bioengineering,10.1002/bit.28975,"Multispecifics are increasingly being evaluated in the pharmaceutical industry due to their unique mechanisms of action, enabled by their multiple antigen-binding capabilities. The complexity of these molecules can make production challenging, prompting the development of various generation approaches. This study employs an electrostatic-steering generation method, where charge-based differences between two parental homodimer antibodies drive correct heterodimerization during a redox reaction of the partially purified parental homodimers. This strategy can achieve high conversion to the heterodimer with minimal product-related impurities. However, it also necessitates separate bioreactors for each parental homodimer, leading to complex manufacturing campaigns. This work introduces a novel bioprocess for electrostatic-steering-based multispecifics, combining two unique components. First, two separate cell lines are cocultured, leading to the simultaneous production of both parental homodimers in a single bioreactor. The second component involves a column-based redox reaction, where the homodimers are captured, and their disulfide bonds are reduced while bound to the protein A resin using a reductant wash. The column is then eluted and neutralized, allowing the reduced parental homodimers to heterodimerize. Finally, the addition of an oxidant enables the reformation of disulfide bonds, completing the formation of the multispecific. This new process is robust and efficient across both the lab bench and manufacturing scales, maintaining well-controlled impurity profiles. Homodimer harvest ratios were consistently within 10%-15% of the target across various cocultured cell lines. Conversions from homodimers to heterodimers exceeded 90%, and multispecific percentages in all tested drug substance pools were above 95%. This strategy aligns the new multispecific bioprocess with typical antibody-like processes, optimizing clinical and commercial manufacturing resources while producing complex multispecific molecules with minimal impurities.",Eriksen-Stapleton D; King M; Dong G; Srivastava D; Iskra T; Aho V; Nguyen K; Ingaharro L; Scarcelli JJ; Ochocki J; Gagnon M; Hartsough R; Keo H; Hulme C; Coyne J; Neubauer C; Creasy A,Pfizer Biomedicine Design; Pfizer Analytical Research and Development; Pfizer Bioprocess Research and Development,

This study assessed the feasibility of using cork powder, an abundant by-product of the cork industry, as a cosmetic ingredient. Key challenges were identified, and effective solutions were proposed for integrating cork powder into cosmetic products. To obtain a suitable ingredient, cork powder was subjected to physical treatment. The resulting heat-treated powder was further characterized for particle size, colour, moisture content, hygroscopicity, pH, oil absorption capacity and heavy metal content. The stability of cork powder, both as a stand-alone ingredient and incorporated into a makeup formulation, was evaluated over 90 days, and its safety was assessed in human keratinocytes and a 3D EpiSkin™ model. Cork powder exhibited a brownish colour, low moisture content (3.03 ± 0.42%) and hygroscopic properties (9.04 ± 0.08%), along with high oil absorption capacity (206.93 ± 2.33 g/100 g) and acceptable heavy metals levels, considering the intended use as cosmetic (As = 0.350 ± 0.020 ppm; Cd = 0.086 ± 0.003 ppm; Hg = 0.005 ± 0.001 ppm; Pb = 1.420 ± 0.030 ppm), which remained stable for at least 90 days. The safety of the powder for skin application was also ensured up to at least 5% content. Using 2% cork powder in O/W formulations provided a colour shade suitable for makeup foundations and remained stable over the 90-day study period. Key challenges in transforming cork by-products into cosmetic ingredients include the standardization of the preparation process, batch uniformity and suitable microbiological burden. Sieving, washing, filtration and heat treatment of cork powder reduced microbial burden and improved batch uniformity. Industrial processing did not introduce contaminants, with heavy metal levels remaining below regulatory limits for cosmetic use. The treatment and storage conditions adopted preserved the physicochemical properties, and pre-formulation and stability studies validated its potential as a sustainable innovative ingredient for decorative and mattifying cosmetics. Transforming by-products into cosmetic ingredients is a stepwise process that must be carefully carried out to ensure optimal performance.

Methods & clinical development,10.1016/j.omtm.2025.101441,"A critical step in manufacturing of adeno-associated viral vectors (AAVs) is separation of full and empty capsids. The current consensus in the industry is that it is critical to enrich for full capsids to deliver safer and more efficacious drug products to patients. Anion-exchange chromatography is well established as a scalable method for full/empty separations. However, due to the poor peak resolution, especially at process-scale column loadings, anion exchange gradient methods are unlikely to be able to achieve >70% full capsids in cases of 5%-20% full capsids in the load material, as the low starting percent full truncates the yield and purity of the elution pools. To overcome this challenge, we propose a ""two-pass"" anion exchange method which is effective in maximally enriching for full capsids. The method consists of a ""first-pass"" elution using a series of microstep increases in conductivity to remove the bulk of the empty capsids, followed by a ""second-pass"" elution in which selected enriched fractions from the first pass are reloaded onto the chromatography column for a final, targeted enrichment.

To clarify the clinical impact of pharmacogenetic testing, this study estimated the potential drug-gene interactions for first-time antidepressant treatment in Japanese patients with major depressive disorder. This study retrospectively included Japanese patients who were registered for depressive episodes (F32, International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision) and initiated on antidepressants between July 2022 and March 2023. Antidepressant prescription rates were calculated using a nationwide hospital-based database (Medical Data Vision Co., Ltd). The incidence of actionable drug-gene interactions was estimated by multiplying the first-time prescription rate of each relevant antidepressant by the frequency of its corresponding actionable phenotype. A total of 3,197 patients were included in the analysis. Escitalopram was the most frequently prescribed antidepressant (18.7%, n = 597), followed by mirtazapine (17.5%, n = 561), and sertraline (15.4%, n = 493). Of the patients receiving their first treatment of major depressive disorder, 56.5% (n = 1,807) were prescribed a drug with actionable pharmacogenetic implications, and 26.4% (n = 844) were estimated to have required actionable therapeutic recommendations. The highest incidence of actionable drug-gene interactions was observed in escitalopram and CYP2C19 pairs (12.4%, n = 398). For sertraline and CYP2C19 or CYP2B6 pairs, the incidence was 11.0% (n = 352). Among all antidepressants, paroxetine had the highest incidence of actionable drug-gene interactions related to CYP2D6 at 1.8% (n = 56); this interaction was rarely observed with other antidepressants (<1%). We estimated that one in four Japanese patients with major depressive disorder who were prescribed first-time antidepressants had actionable drug-gene interactions. These results suggest that pre-emptive pharmacogenetic testing in the treatment of major depressive disorder could have important clinical implications.",,,

The aim of this work was to reach different therapeutics targets by co-encapsulating three neuroprotective substances with hypotensive (latanoprost), antioxidant (melatonin) and anti-inflammatory (ketorolac) activity in biodegradable poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) microspheres (MSs) capable of releasing the drugs for months after intravitreal injection, avoiding the need for repeated administrations. Multi-loaded PLGA MSs were prepared using the oil-in-water emulsion solvent extraction-evaporation technique and physicochemically characterized. PLGA 85:15 was the polymer ratio selected for the selected formulation. Tri-loaded MSs including vitamin E as additive showed good tolerance in retinal pigment epithelium cells after 24 h exposure (>90% cell viability). The final formulation (KMLVE) resulted in 33.58 ± 5.44 µm particle size and drug content (µg/mg MSs) of 39.70 ± 5.89, 67.28 ± 4.17 and 7.51 ± 0.58 for melatonin, ketorolac and latanoprost respectively.

Mixed infections are also a major concern, as they frequently relapse, increase the risk of severe malaria, require more accurate diagnosis for appropriate treatment, and contribute to the development of drug resistance. A 25-year-old soldier was diagnosed with malaria following deployment in South Sudan. A comprehensive survey identified an asymptomatic Plasmodium falciparum infection, confirmed by peripheral blood smear and polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Despite being discharged after treatment, the patient developed fever and other symptoms one month later. Subsequent laboratory tests confirmed Plasmodium ovale infection based on peripheral blood smears and PCR. This case underscores the importance of molecular detection for surveillance and vigilant follow-up in malaria management, particularly among patients with a history of deployment in endemic regions.

40211372,"Antibiotics governance in aquaculture: knowledge, practices, and challenges among stakeholders on the Volta Lake in Ghana.",,One health outlook,10.1186/s42522-025-00141-z,"The use and misuse of antibiotics for treating animal and human infections are a key driver of the emergence of resistant bacterial strains at the human-animal-environment interface. This inappropriate use threatens ecological balance and poses a significant risk to human health. The lack of relevant knowledge of the right attitudes and practices regarding antimicrobial stewardship among fish farmers, antibiotic drug retailers, and government agencies has significantly exacerbated this serious environmental and public health issue. To enhance understanding and improve communication for the implementation of sound antimicrobial stewardship in the fish farming industry in Ghana, this study aimed to assess the knowledge, attitude, and practices of key stakeholders regarding the use of antibiotics in cage aquaculture on Volta Lake in Ghana. We conducted a qualitative field survey involving interviews, key informant discussions, and observations. The participants were veterinary drug retailers and government officials from the fisheries, aquaculture, and veterinary sectors to gather insights about their knowledge, attitudes, and practices on antibiotics use in aquaculture. The study covered 40 respondents, comprising 18 veterinary drug retailers, 12 general pharmaceutical shop operators, five Fisheries Commission officials, and five government-trained veterinary personnel operating along the stratum II of the Volta Lake of Ghana. All quantitative and qualitative data were analysed using STATA and thematic analysis. The survey revealed that drug retailers possess limited knowledge, expertise, and education on the use of antibiotics in fish farming. It was found that drug sellers occasionally recommend treatment regimens to fish farmers based on observable symptoms associated with specific diseases. The results further revealed a lack of regulation in selling veterinary drugs to farmers. Government officials, on their part, strive to create awareness and educate farmers on the selection and appropriate use of antibiotics through routine quarterly inspections, thereby promoting best practices for cultivating healthy fish. Despite this, the results indicate insufficient coordination between government officials, drug retailers, and fish farmers regarding the usage of antibiotics in aquaculture on Lake Volta. Regular joint training programs are encouraged to improve and enhance knowledge, attitudes, and practices among government officials, veterinary drug retailers, and fish farmers. In addition, monitoring the activities of drug sellers and users, as well as fostering effective communication among all stakeholders, will significantly aid in reducing antibiotic use, misuse, and abuse in aquaculture. Under the One Health framework, efforts to integrate veterinary drug retailers, farmers, and other stakeholders of concern in antibiotic governance are required to address the increasing burden of antibiotic misuse and abuse in aquaculture in Ghana and the world.",,,eabarike@uds.edu.gh.

However, there are discrepancies on the optimal nitrogen (N) application rate at the flowering stage to achieve maximum yield and if, or how, this interacts with clones from different seed lines of the same genotype. This research examined the relationship between N application rate, concentration of cannabinoids and biomass yield of a CBD-type medicinal cannabis cultivar in clones propagated from five different seed lines (hereafter referred to as clones). Clonal rooted cuttings were propagated from five mother plants germinated from seeds of cultivar 'Tas1'. Five N levels (30, 90, 160, 240 and 400 mg/L N) were imposed at the start of the inflorescence period and continued until harvest eight weeks later. Some pollen contamination occurred during the trial so that seed biomass was assessed for each plant and included in statistical analysis. Weight of total biomass, leaves and inflorescence (from upper and lower canopy positions), N%, and cannabinoid concentrations were measured after the harvest. Results indicated that increasing N supply generated a clear upward trend in inflorescence biomass that peaked at 160 mg/L N after which it did not significantly change, while leaf biomass steadily increased with N. Delta9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD) concentrations decreased significantly with increasing N concentration in leaves with a similar, but non-significant, trend for inflorescences. The CBD to THC ratio increased with increased N. Clone source was strongly correlated with cannabinoid concentration, but not leaf, inflorescence or total biomass, across all N treatments. Clones 13 and 27 developed greater cannabinoid concentrations relative to clones 18 and 26 irrespective of N treatment. Pollen contamination induced seed development that comprised up to 5% of inflorescence biomass dry weight but this did not significantly affect whole-plant biomass, N accumulation (N%), or cannabinoid concentration. These findings provide valuable insights for improving cannabinoid yield in this widely cultivated plant species.",,,enrico.dilena@utas.edu.au.

It found that the low concentration of fig tree stem (Ficus carica L.) stem aqueous extracts (5.0-10.0 g/L) not only promoted the seed of another medicinal plant S. grosvenorii, but also significantly improved its biomass and photosynthetic parameters. However, with the increase of the concentration of fig tree stem aqueous extracts (15.0-25.0 g/L), the activities of superoxide dismutase and peroxidase of S. grosvenorii first increased and then decreased, and the content of malondialdehyde increased.

In this context, the biocontrol fungus Bipolaris bicolor WZU-HOG4, isolated from Ougan pericarp, was identified as possessing antimicrobial activity. Through bioassay-guided fractionation and subsequent metabolite profiling, N-Acetyl-O-methyl-tyrosine was identified as the active antifungal compound using NMR and HRESIMS. This compound demonstrated significant inhibitory effects against C. gloeosporioides and other pathogens, exhibiting a relatively broad-spectrum antifungal activity. Molecular docking analysis indicated that N-acetyl-O-methyl-tyrosine binds to tyrosinase with greater affinity than Vitamin C, effectively inhibiting its activity. Furthermore, Ougan fruits treated with the compound exhibited increased activities of antioxidant enzymes SOD, POD, and CAT, reduced MDA content, and decreased oxidative stress during storage. Cytotoxicity assays conducted on HEK-293 cells confirmed the compound's safety at the tested concentrations.

From 291 LAB isolates, 84 genetically diverse strains were selected via rep-PCR. MALDI-TOF identification revealed multiple species, predominantly Enterococcus faecalis (n = 37), Enterococcus faecium (n = 21), Lactiplantibacillus plantarum (n = 5) and Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus (n = 3). The antagonistic activity of these strains was evaluated against Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212, Listeria monocytogenes ATCC 5779, and Escherichia coli O157:H7 using spot-on-lawn assays. Several strains showed strong inhibitory effects against E. coli and L. monocytogenes, with halo/colony ratios reaching 4.86 and 4.47, respectively. No antimicrobial peptide producing strain was observed. Antibiotic susceptibility was tested against nine antibiotics, and five strains were susceptible to all antibiotics, while 53 strains were susceptible to 5-8 antibiotics. However, five strains were resistant to all antibiotics, showing the highest resistance to gentamicin (66.7%), cotrimoxazole (58.3%), and streptomycin (57.2%). Resistance genes (aacA-aphD, ermA/B, tetM/O/K/L/S, blaZ, and vanA/B) were screened, and 40 strains harbored at least one gene. Taken together, these results revealed three antibiotic-susceptible bioprotective lactobacilli (L. rhamnosus 52, L. plantarum 177, and L. plantarum 272G) as superior strains, whose efficacy in eliminating E. coli O157 and Listeria monocytogenes in the milk matrix between 7- and 21-days post-inoculation was confirmed.

Likewise, the predicted human dose regimen for efficacy and safety provides critical insight into clinical development planning. As such, human dose predictions are commonly generated in early stages of research and continually revisited as new data are generated through development. In this work, the authors illustrate scenarios where conventional approaches based on discrete pharmacokinetic metrics are inappropriate and propose a generalizable approach leveraging a predicted average pharmacodynamic effect rather than pharmacokinetic metrics. Preclinical and clinical data of a JAK inhibitor, tofacitinib, were used to illustrate the relative value of this approach to human dose prediction. Due to the simplicity of implementation, pharmacokinetic-based approaches which target a discrete maximal, average, or minimum concentration have been widely used across the pharmaceutical industry. However, in emphasizing only one point on the overall exposure-time profile, such approaches can be misleading in terms of the expected pharmacodynamic effect. For future projections, the authors recommend using the average pharmacodynamic effect-based approach to calculate human efficacious dose.",Li R; Maurer TS,Translational Modeling and Simulation,

Along with the restriction of antibiotics, natural compounds targeting bacterial virulence factors are supposed to be efficacious and attractive alternatives for controlling ETEC infection. This study aimed to investigate the influence of dihydromyricetin (DMY), a natural flavonoid compound, on the expression of virulence factors of ETEC and intestinal inflammatory injury. DMY interfered with the quorum sensing (QS) of ETEC K88 since it decreased AI-2 secretion and downregulated the expression of LuxS and Pfs, which dominate AI-2 production, and decreased the expression mRNA level of genes (lsrA, lsrB, lsrC, lsrD, lsrK, and lsrR) that are involved in AI-2 internalization and signal transduction. Additionally, DMY markedly dampened the expression of QS-related virulence genes (elt-1, estB, fliC, faeG), biofilm formation, cell adhesion, and stress tolerance of ETEC K88. Furthermore, DMY treatment applied to the ETEC K88 infection in mice model resulted in decreased amount of heat-labile (LT) and heat-stable (ST) enterotoxins, reduced production of cAMP and cGMP, downregulated protein level of CFTR and upregulated expression of NHE3 in the ileum. In addition, the mRNA expression of proinflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6) and histological damage in the ileum were significantly decreased by DMY treatment. DMY can inhibit the AI-2 QS and virulence factor expression, thereby attenuating the virulence of ETEC and alleviating intestinal inflammatory damage in ETEC K88-challenged mice.

40204777,Long-term expansion of basal cells and the novel differentiation methods identify mechanisms for switching Claudin expression in normal epithelia.,2025-04-09,Scientific reports,10.1038/s41598-025-95463-3,"Epithelia are tightly connected cellular sheets, that shield our body from the external environment. They are continuously maintained by a pooled population of undifferentiated cells through differentiation. However, the maintenance mechanisms remain incompletely understood due to the difficulty of experimentally observing the differentiation process. To address this issue, we developed a culture method for long-term expansion of primary mammary basal cells with a set of compounds, that includes undifferentiated cells. An effective differentiation method regarding Claudin expression was also developed by simply removing compounds. To verify this differentiation-switching technique, we obtained microarray data comparing each differentiation state. Subsequent cellular analysis confirmed key transcription factors in each state: (1) EGR1 in undifferentiated basal cells is important for suppressing Claudin expression through maintaining the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) transcription factor TWIST1, (2) ELF3 in differentiated cells is important for actin organization and subsequent Claudin localization at the cell-cell border, that corresponds to the amount of GRHL3, an actin organizer. Their relevance was also observed in tissues and organoids. In summary, we present an effective tool for verifying molecular mechanisms that determine Claudin status in normal basal cell differentiation, that would be beneficial in epithelial cell biology, cancer biology, physiology, and regeneration research.",,,inoko.akihito.288@mail.aichi-med-u.ac.jp.

The experimental diets included three different levels of ACD concentrations: 0 g/kg (CTRL) as the control, 1 g/kg (ACD1), and 2 g/kg (ACD2). These ACD were sprayed onto the diets and fish were fed to Nile tilapia (7.12 ± 0.47 g) for 56 days. The results indicated that increasing the dietary content of ACD significantly enhanced growth performance, as reflected in higher final body weight, specific growth rate, average daily gain, and feed efficiency. The ACD2 diet showed improved outcomes compared to the CTRL diet. Fish fed ACD diets showed significantly higher antioxidant enzyme activity compared to the CTRL diet and were able to maintain their antioxidant status throughout the experiment. The activity of digestive enzymes, including protease, amylase, and lipase, was significantly increased in fish fed diets supplemented with varying levels of 1 and 2 g/kg diet compared to the CTRL diet (P < 0.05). Additionally, significant increases were observed in the thickness of the intestinal muscularis and the width of the intestinal villi in fish fed ACD at concentrations of 1 and 2 g/kg of the diet, compared to the CTRL diet (P < 0.05). Moreover, dietary supplementation with ACD at concentrations of 2 g/kg of the diet significantly upregulated the expression of immune-related genes (P < 0.05). Overall, the use of ACD in fish diets has shown improvements in growth performance, immune responses, and intestinal histology, indicating their potential as a beneficial feed additive for Nile tilapia aquaculture.

The nutrient-rich milk environment supports bacterial growth, but the specific genetic determinants that facilitate S. aureus proliferation and persistence in milk are poorly understood. In this study, we conducted a genome-wide CRISPR interference sequencing (CRISPRi-seq) screen with the laboratory strain S. aureus NCTC8325-4, to identify fitness determinants essential for S. aureus growth and survival in milk. We identified 282 milk-essential genes, including those with key roles in DNA replication, protein synthesis, and metabolism. Comparative analysis with brain heart infusion (BHI) as growth medium, revealed 79 genes with differential fitness, highlighting specific adaptations required for growth in milk. Notably, we found that purine biosynthesis, folate cycle pathways, and metal acquisition were particularly important in this environment. Based on this, we further demonstrate that S. aureus is more sensitive to the folate inhibitors trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) in milk and identify several genes whose knockdown results in hypersensitivity to TMP-SMX in milk. Additionally, our analysis showed a relatively reduced importance of cell wall components, such as teichoic acids, for S. aureus fitness in milk, which is also reflected in reduced efficiency of antimicrobials targeting teichoic acids. Together, these findings provide new insights into the genetic basis of S. aureus fitness and antibiotic susceptibility in milk, offering directions for novel treatment strategies against bovine mastitis.",,,

While the presence of some bacteria in semen is considered as normal, high bacterial loads detrimentally affect sperm quality and fertilizing ability, thus having a negative repercussion on the efficiency of artificial insemination. For this reason, the present chapter focuses on the methods used for the assessment of semen contamination in farm animals. Routinely, bacterial culture is performed to assess the overall degree of contamination in sperm samples; in some cases, however, the identification of bacterial species is needed to determine the optimal antibiotic composition of semen preservation media and address whether those bacteria have developed antibiotic resistance. In addition, other techniques, such as scanning electron microscopy, can be used to evaluate sperm-bacteria interaction. This chapter also discusses the strategies to prevent bacteria contamination in semen. As the ejaculate is not a sterile fluid, media for preservation usually include, as aforementioned, antibiotics to avoid bacterial growth. Because of the mounting restriction in the usage of antibiotics, which is due to the increase of bacterial resistance, other approaches to prevent bacterial contamination of semen include preservation at low temperatures (5 °C) and the inclusion of alternative molecules such as antimicrobial peptides.",,,marc.yeste@udg.edu.

Steroid hormone receptors (SHRs) within the nuclear receptor superfamily are well-known targets for EDCs in reproductive tissues and, to a lesser extent, in liver. In this study, we investigated how five well-established SHR ligands and eight EDCs including pesticides, plasticizers, pharmaceuticals, flame retardants, industrial chemicals, and their metabolites affect estrogen (ERα in reproductive tissues) and glucocorticoid (GR in liver) receptors. We investigated the utility of structural molecular modeling to classify EDC binding to ERα and GR. To this end, we modeled a set of EDC binding to ER and GR using unbiased all-atom long-time scale molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and compared them against known established SHR agonists and antagonists. We systematically evaluated MD-derived variables such as protein-ligand interactions and binding energy, folding secondary structure elements, distances, and angles as relevant parameters. Our findings suggest that the well-established H12 folding and conformational angles can be discerning features for binding of EDCs to SHRs. Although SHR activation often involves changes in H12 folding and geometry, GR displayed less flexibility in this region, suggesting that protein-ligand interaction and binding energy are more relevant for its classification. We show that MD simulations combined with experimental assays can be a useful tool for studying novel EDCs by providing relevant structural features for their classification.",Maltarollo VG,Departamento de Produtos Farmacêuticos,

Synovial macrophage polarization is pivotal in TMJ-OA progression, making it a promising therapeutic aspect. This study investigated the effects of S-propargyl-cysteine (SPRC), an endogenous H2S donor, on macrophage polarization and its therapeutic potential in alleviating TMJ-OA. A MIA-induced TMJ-OA rat model and LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 macrophages were employed to evaluate the effects of SPRC in vivo and in vitro. TMJ bone and cartilage were analyzed via micro-CT and histological methods, while macrophage polarization markers expression were assessed via RT-qPCR, western blot, and immunofluorescence. RNA sequencing was performed on macrophages, and the JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway was validated using the JAK2-specific inhibitor AG490. The direct effects of SPRC on rat primary condylar chondrocytes were examined by evaluating ECM synthesis and degradation. Co-culture experiments further assessed macrophage-chondrocyte interactions. SPRC significantly alleviated cartilage and bone damage in the TMJ-OA rat model, as demonstrated by improved bone volume and cartilage structure. SPRC reduced pro-inflammatory M1 macrophage infiltration and enhanced anti-inflammatory M2 macrophage polarization. SPRC effectively inhibited the JAK2/STAT3, leading to reduction of inflammatory markers, including TNF-α, IL-6, and iNOS. Co-culture experiments revealed that SPRC-treated macrophage-conditioned medium improved chondrocyte metabolic activity and restored ECM integrity. SPRC-modulated macrophage polarization alleviates TMJ-OA via JAK/STAT downregulation, thereby reducing synovial inflammation and cartilage degradation.

To assess the role and mechanism of Tsd-G in reversing paclitaxel (PTX) resistance, the reversal fold of Tsd-G in combination with PTX on OC PTX-resistant (A2780/T) cells was determined using CCK-8 assay. The apoptosis level and migration ability of A2780/T cells after 24 h treatment with Tsd-G and PTX were assessed by Hoechst 33,342, flow cytometry, and wound healing assay. Western Blot and Src overexpression plasmid were used to explore the relationship between Src and PTX resistance. The relationship between Src expression and human OC was analyzed by gene expression database. The effect of Tsd-G on P-gp activity was detected by flow cytometry. Western blot and RT-PCR experiments were performed to detect the differences in mRNA and protein expression of Src/PTN/P-gp signaling axis to validate the mechanism of Tsd-G in reversing the resistance to PTX in ovarian cancer. The results showed that Tsd-G reverses PTX resistance in ovarian cancer cells by regulating cell proliferation, cell cycle, inducing apoptosis, and inhibiting migration. The mechanism might associate with the inhibition of Src expression and phosphorylation activation, which in turn inhibits the expression and activity of downstream PTN and P-gp. This study provides a new idea for the treatment of PTX-resistant OC patients and provides theoretical support for revealing the anti-ovarian cancer active ingredients in Marsdenia tenacissima.",,,yonglongh@126.com.

After WAS, memory function and depressive-like behavior were investigated in Tg2576 mice. Tg2576 WAS mice exhibited more depressive-like behaviors than WT WAS and Tg2576 control (CON) mice. Strikingly, Tg2576 CON mice showed more depressive-like behaviors than WT mice. Moreover, corticosterone and phospho-glucocorticoid receptor (p-GR) levels were also higher in Tg2576 WAS mice in comparison to Tg2576 CON mice. Spinster homologue 2 (SPNS2) is a member of non-ATP-dependent transporter. The role of SPNS2 was widely known as a sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) transporter, which export intracellular S1P from cells. Using GEO database to analyze SPNS2 gene expression changes in patients with AD and depression, we show that SPNS2 gene expression correlates with AD and depression. Interestingly, Tg2576 WAS mice displayed significantly increased levels of SPNS2 w1hen compared to Tg2576 CON counterparts. SPNS2 levels were also higher in Tg2576 CON mice in comparison with WT CON mice. Remarkably, we found a decrease in S1P brain levels and an increase in S1P serum levels of Tg2576 WAS mice in comparison with Tg2576 CON mice. Accordingly, WAS induced group further decreased S1P levels in the brains. However, the level in the serum further increased in comparison with non-induced group. Therefore, these results suggest that AD and depression could be associated, and that Tg2576 transgenic mice are more susceptible to stress-induced depression through the release of S1P by SPNS2 up-regulation.",Lee DW,Ministry of Food and Drug Safety (MFDS),

We developed an interpretable deep learning model, the AF-Biological-IS-Path (ABioSPath), to predict one-year IS risk in AF patients by integrating drug-protein-disease pathways with real-world clinical data. Using a heterogeneous multilayer network, ABioSPath identifies mechanisms of drug actions and the propagation of comorbid diseases. By combining mechanistic pathways with patient-specific characteristics, the model provides individualized IS risk assessments and identifies potential molecular pathways involved. We utilized the electronic health record data from 7859 AF patients, collected between January 2008 and December 2009 across 43 hospitals in Hong Kong. ABioSPath outperformed baseline models in all evaluation metrics, achieving an AUROC of 0.7815 (95% CI: 0.7346-0.8283), a positive predictive value of 0.430, a negative predictive value of 0.870, a sensitivity of 0.500, a specificity of 0.885, an average precision of 0.409, and a Brier score of 0.195. Cohort-level analysis identified key proteins, such as CRP, REN, and PTGS2, within the most common pathways. Individual-level analysis further highlighted the importance of PIK3/Akt and cytokine and chemokine signaling pathways and identified IS risks associated with less-studied drugs like prochlorperazine maleate. ABioSPath offers a robust, data-driven approach for IS risk prediction, requiring only routinely collected clinical data without the need for costly biomarkers. Beyond IS, the model has potential applications in screening risks for other diseases, enhancing patient care, and providing insights for drug development.",Lyu Z; Cheng W; Zhang Q,,

Its use in the form of nanoparticles (NPs) has gained significant attention in agricultural applications. Green synthesized Zn-based NPs offer an eco-friendly solution to several conventional problems in agriculture. Several plants, bacteria, fungi and yeast have shown significant potential in fabricating Zn NPs that can provide environmentally friendly solutions in agriculture and the approach is aligned with sustainable agricultural practices, reducing the dependency on harmful agrochemicals. Zn-based NPs act as plant growth promoters, enhance crop yield, promote resilience to abiotic stressors and are efficient crop protection agents. Their role as a smart delivery system, enabling targeted and controlled release of agrochemicals, further signifies their potential use in agriculture. Because agriculture requires repeated applications hence, the toxicological aspects of Zn NPs cannot be ignored. Zn NPs are reported to cause phytotoxicity, including root damage, physiological and biochemical disturbances, and genotoxic effects. Furthermore, exposure to Zn NPs poses risks to soil microbiota, and aquatic and terrestrial organisms potentially impacting the ecosystem. The green synthesis of Zn-based NPs has a promising aspect for advancing sustainable agriculture by reducing agrochemical use and improving crop productivity. Their diverse applications as plant growth promoters, crop protectants and smart delivery systems emphasize their potential.

Both polyolefins and PS, when inappropriately disposed of in the environment, contribute to environmental contamination since they degrade slowly, with both abiotic and biotic factors contributing to their downgrade. In terms of the microbial effect on plastics, in recent decades, several studies have focused on the biodeterioration and assimilation of polyolefins, while more comprehensive degradation of PS by diverse organisms, including bacteria, fungi, and even insect larvae, has been documented. The present study investigates the biocatalytic potential of the white-rot basidiomycete Abortiporus biennis LGAM 436 for PS degradation. Building on prior research, we examined the ability of this fungal strain to modify the structure of different PS forms, including commercial expanded polystyrene (EPS) foam and amorphous PS film. In addition, we explored the impact of olive oil mill wastewater (OOMW) effluent as an enzymatic inducer to enhance the degradation process.

When ketosis occurs in dairy cows, the levels of β-hydroxybutyrate (BHBA), an abundant form of ketone bodies, in the blood increase significantly. Elevated BHBA levels have been shown to negatively impact reproductive performance and increase the incidence of periparturient diseases in dairy cows, including mastitis and endometritis. However, the role of BHBA in the development of endometritis in dairy cows and its underlying mechanisms remain largely unclear. The present study was designed to investigate the specific role of BHBA in the development of endometritis using an inflammatory response model of the bovine endometrial epithelial cell line (BENDs). Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide (LPS) treatment (1 μg/mL) significantly increased the expression levels of interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-1β, as well as the phosphorylation of p65 and IκB in BENDs. In addition, co-treatment with BHBA (2.4 mM) and LPS (1 μg/mL) significantly increased the expression levels of proinflammatory cytokines (IL-6, IL-1β, and IL-8), as well as the phosphorylation of p65 and IκB, compared to the LPS-only treatment group. Immunofluorescence staining showed that the addition of LPS altered the nuclear localization of p65, and co-treatment with BHBA and LPS further promoted the translocation of p65 to the nucleus. Additionally, the addition of BHBA significantly increased the levels of oxidation indicators (MDA), whereas the levels of antioxidative indicators, including heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) and catalase (CAT), were markedly decreased in BENDs. As a representative antioxidant, N-acetylcysteine (NAC) treatment significantly reduced the phosphorylation of p65 and IκB in the BHBA and LPS co-treatment group. SC75741, an NF-κB signaling pathway inhibitor, significantly decreased the expression levels of proinflammatory cytokines (IL-6, IL-1β, IL-8, and CCL5) in the BHBA and LPS co-treatment group. In summary, the current study demonstrates that BHBA aggravates LPS-induced inflammatory response in BENDs through the activation of oxidative stress/NF-κB signaling pathway, unravelling the mechanism by which BHBA exacerbates the inflammatory response in the BENDs of dairy cattle. This study elucidates the role of ketosis and its key metabolite BHBA in the pathogenesis of endometritis in dairy cows, providing valuable insights for understanding this pathological process.",,,yapingjin@163.com.

The use of low-temperature plasma to decontaminate the maize is a potential solution for ensuring the safety and extended shelf life of the grain. This study optimized the parameters and investigated the efficacy of low-temperature nitrogen plasma (LTNP) in destroying fungi and reducing exposure to aflatoxins in naturally contaminated maize from an endemic region. The study generated 17 experimental runs using the Response Surface Methodology (RSM) of the Box Behnken Design (BBD) with exposure time, pressure, and ionization density as independent variables. Quantitative exposure assessment was conducted using Monte Carlo simulations followed by sensitivity and scenario analysis to study factors influencing exposure and best aflatoxin-reducing plasma parameters. The best-fitting RSM model, the linear model, indicated that increased exposure time but not pressure and power led to a corresponding statistically significant decrease in the fungal load and aflatoxin content. LTNP reduced aflatoxin contamination to levels below all the main global regulatory limits. Numerical optimization of the percent reduction in aflatoxin and fungal load indicated that an exposure time of 1793.4 s, pressure of 0.98 pascal and ionization power of 189.8 W are required to achieve an optimal reduction of aflatoxin content of 82.6% and fungal load of 96.9%. Exposure assessment indicated high exposure especially for populations with lower body weight with ρ = -0.46 between body weight and exposure. The best LTNP combinations achieved aflatoxin exposure reduction results comparable to but with markedly less variation than existing practically used decontamination methods.

However, the prevalence of Trichomonas spp., a group of parasites known to induce diarrhea in various hosts, presents significant challenges in breeding facilities. These parasites pose a substantial threat to the pig breeding industry. Furthermore, despite its prevalence, diagnosing Trichomonas spp. is often challenging, primarily owing to the presence of mixed infections involving different species within clinical samples. To address this concern, we developed a novel isolation method that combines a single-cell isolation culture technique with an antimicrobial drug susceptibility test. Trichomonas was isolated and cultured by using the established single-worm separation technology combined with antibacterial drug screening method, and it was identified as Pentatrichomonas hominis by molecular biological identification and morphological identification.

Waxes are the most used oleogelators and are generally recognized as safe (GRAS) by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The properties of oleogels prepared from different types of waxes vary in their physiochemical composition, which may affect their deep-frying performance. In this study, soybean oil-based oleogels prepared from four different types of waxes (i.e., beeswax, carnauba wax, candelilla wax, and rice bran wax) were developed to evaluate their deep-frying performance of carbohydrate-based food (potato chips) for 20 frying cycles. Results showed that all oleogels retarded the oxidative compounds' (hydroperoxides, aldehydes, ketones) formation during deep-frying. Further, beeswax oleogel (BWO) showed superior stability (free fatty acid = 0.176%) towards hydrolysis compared to the other oleogels (free fatty acid = 0.344-0.427%). Similarly, the potato chips fried with BWO had the lowest total oxidation (TOTOX) value (252.15). The result revealed that the excellent frying stability of BWO could be attributed to its exceptional oil binding capacity and stronger gel network formation that reduces the entrainment of moisture during the cooling phase of intermittent frying. In short, BWO showed potential to be used as an alternative deep-frying medium with excellent oxidative stability, opening an alternative to the development of a zero trans-fat high stability frying medium. © 2025 The Author(s).

Laser lithotripsy was performed in three groups: manual procedure (group M), robotic procedures without respiratory synchronization (group RNR), and robotic procedures with respiratory synchronization (group RR). The study assessed fragmentation time, laser time, number of mucosal contacts, and total energy used. Two surgeons having different experience of conventional RIRS (> 2500 and < 500) were participated. In overall results of the two surgeons, the fragmentation time significantly decreased to 74.8% in group RNR (P = 0.012) and 65.0% in group RR (P = 0.001), compared to group M. The laser time was significantly shorter in group RR compared to the group M (P = 0.003). The number of mucosal contacts was significantly reduced to 37.4% in group RNR (P = 0.048) and it was 34.0% in group RR, compared to group M. The total energy significantly decreased in group RR compared to group M (P = 0.011). There were no significant differences between group RR and RNR across all outcomes in the overall results of the two surgeons. For less experienced surgeon, the fragmentation time was significantly shorter in group RR compared to group RNR (P = 0.013). Robotic-assisted RIRS resulted in reduced fragmentation time, laser time, mucosal contacts, and total energy compared to manual RIRS during laser lithotripsy. The incorporation of respiratory synchronization in robotic-assisted RIRS reduced laser time compared to manual RIRS and shortened the fragmentation time compared to the robotic-assisted RIRS without respiratory synchronization, particularly for less experienced surgeon. These initial results demonstrated the feasibility of robotic-assisted RIRS with respiratory synchronization, highlighting its potential to improve procedural efficiency and safety.",Kim J; Song KS; Kim JC; Kim J; Kwon DS,ROEN Surgical,moretry@snu.ac.kr.

Such process improvement in fermentation often translates to challenges in recovering intracellularly expressed recombinant proteins due to increased matrix complexity, resulting in a higher performance burden in midstream. Tangential flow filtration (TFF) is a popular industry standard for buffer exchange and protein separation from cellular debris. However, due to variations in the physicochemical properties of recombinant proteins, solutions for E. coli-based protein clarification remain challenging and often necessitate extensive exploration and process optimization. With growing options in filtration-based technologies, the identification of a near-universal clarification platform is desirable to accelerate bioprocess development overall. In this study, three TFF modalities, hollow fibre (HF), flat-sheet cassette (CAS), and vibro membrane filtration (VMF), were assessed in parallel to evaluate their clarification performance for three E. coli recombinant proteins with different biochemical properties. Reverse phase liquid chromatography data showed target protein recovery was uniformly higher for VMF than HF at equivalent loading. Cell density and lysate protein load were comparable for HF and VMF, and lower for CAS. These results support the choice of VMF and HF as easily optimized and operated TFF modalities for clarification of recombinant protein from complex crude bacterial matrix, where either can be efficiently performed with ease and minimum supervision. Both TFF applications were successfully demonstrated in primary cell harvest, cell wash and cell lysate clarification, for E. coli-based recombinant proteins. High-density E. coli microfiltration and lysate clarification were tested for three diverse recombinant proteins, where hollow fibre and vibro membrane filtration outperformed flat sheet cassette in terms of process time, suspended solid loading, and target protein recovery.",Reid J; Ni J; Chen A; Gomes P; Szto A; Yu A; Luo A; Kong B; Adams C; Jeyachandran N; Amir A; Teixeira X; Yuan T; Charretier C,Global Bioprocess Development - Drug Substance Development,

Ozonation, an eco-friendly modification technique, effectively addresses these challenges by oxidizing starch molecules, introducing carbonyl and carboxyl functional groups, and partially cleaving glycosidic bonds. These structural modifications enhance the functional, mechanical, and barrier properties of starch, making it a promising material for biodegradable food packaging films. Additionally, ozone treatment improves key physicochemical properties such as gelatinization behavior, pasting characteristics, crystallinity, solubility, and viscosity. This review explores the application of gaseous and aqueous ozone in modifying various starch sources, including cassava, wheat, rice, corn, sago, and potato starches. Furthermore, it delineates different ozone generation methods, such as corona discharge, dielectric barrier discharge, and microwave ultraviolet (UV) systems. The impact of ozonation on starch structure, its functionalization for packaging films, and the challenges associated with scaling up industrial ozonation processes are critically discussed. Finally, this review provides recommendations for optimizing ozone-based starch modification and advancing innovative ozone generation technologies to enhance industrial feasibility and sustainable packaging solutions.",,,wanglidong-521@163.com.

In recent years, enzyme-loaded polymersomes, serving as therapeutic nanoreactors, have drawn substantial interest. A crucial requirement for effective catalytic function is to impart semipermeability to the vesicular membrane while maintaining its role as a protective barrier for encapsulated enzymes. However, achieving both long-term stability and optimal membrane permeability for sustained functionality remains a challenge in many reported examples. In this study, we introduce ROS-responsive polyion complex vesicles (PICsomes) loaded with antioxidant enzymes (catalase) as antioxidative nanoreactors. The intrinsic semipermeability and crosslinked network structure of the membrane enable long-lasting catalytic function of catalase. The nanoreactor exhibits inherent cell-protective properties against oxidative stress in fibroblasts due to the ROS-scavenging ability of polymers. Notably, triggered by ROS, the nanoreactor demonstrates autoregulatory control of redox homeostasis. This is because the cysteamine released by PICsomes not only acts as a free radical scavenger but also facilitates the transport of L-cysteine into cells, thereby enhancing glutathione (GSH) biosynthesis. The results further demonstrate significant long blood circulation of PICsomes loaded with catalase and strong protection effects against bloodstream oxidative stress, paving the way for the further development of truly effective in vivo therapeutics. These findings underscore the potential of the engineered antioxidative nanoreactor with durable functionality as synthetic organelles for cellular protection against oxidative stress.",,,tanaka.masaru.763@m.kyushu-u.ac.jp.

This study investigates the toxicological effects of PBDEs on sturgeon embryos, focusing on BDE-47, a representative PBDEs homologues. Siberian sturgeon embryos were exposed to BDE-47, revealing significant reductions in hatching and survival rates and the occurrence of developmental abnormalities. Oxidative stress induction by BDE-47 was evidenced by increased antioxidant enzyme activities and the presence of oxidative damage biomarker MDA. Besides, transcriptome analysis unveiled the activation of integrin signaling pathways, with molecular docking indicating strong binding to integrin receptors (specifically ITG-α5, ITG-α8, and ITG-α11). Moreover, qPCR and correlation analysis showed that BDE-47 significantly upregulated inflammatory cytokines and keap1/nrf2 signaling through ITGs. Furthermore, cultivation of head kidney macrophages showed that ITGs antagonist Cilengitide significantly reversed the upregulation of the above factors induced by BDE-47, including nf-κb, il-6, tnf-α, gpx, and nrf2. These findings indicate that BDE-47 induced embryotoxicity in Siberian sturgeon, which was potentially via ITGs-mediated oxidative stress and inflammatory pathways. This study providing novel insights into the protein binding of BDE-47 in animals, contributes to understanding emerging pollutant toxicity in fish embryos and offering a new perspective for the improvement of hatchability and survival rate of cultured sturgeon embryos to guarantee the sustainable development of the sturgeon aquaculture industry, as well as providing evidence for wild sturgeon populations conservation and habitat restoration.",,,zhangxinscny@163.com.

Although Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists (RAs) and Cholecystokinin (CCK) RAs have shown some promise in AD research, little is known about the neuroprotective effects of a novel dual CCK/GLP-1 RA in AD. This study sought to examine the effects of the novel dual CCK/GLP-1 RA on cognitive performance in an AD mouse model and to explore the associated mechanisms. Our findings indicate that dual CCK/GLP-1 RA improved cognitive deficits, reduced amyloid-beta (Aβ) accumulation, and alleviated mitochondrial damage in 5 × FAD mice by inducing mitophagy. In an in vitro model of AD cells induced by Aβ, CCK/GLP-1 RA could exert neuroprotective effects by regulating PINK1/Parkin-mediated mitophagy. These data reveal for the first time that the new CCK/GLP-1 RA modulates mitophagy via PINK1/Parkin pathway and enhances cognitive function in the 5 × FAD animal model.

40183520,The need to consider market access for pharmaceutical investment decisions: a primer.,2025-04-16,Journal of comparative effectiveness research,10.57264/cer-2025-0036,"Biotech/Pharma investors employ valuation methods to support capital deployment that consider the costs of drug development, projected sales and risks of failure. Often, the major focus for valuation is placed on the likely success rates of taking a compound from phase I to regulatory approval, with the notion being that just by obtaining regulatory approval sales will follow. However, as exemplified by recent cases with hemophilia gene therapies, achieving forecasted sales depends not only on regulatory success but crucially on market access outcomes. This primer examines how pharmaceutical investment decisions must consider market access factors, particularly in light of recent regulatory changes such as the US Inflation Reduction Act and European Union Joint Clinical Assessment. Effective market access strategies can enhance commercial success through better pricing, broader reimbursement, and/or faster uptake, and having a clear market access plan should encourage investment by providing a clearer path to commercial success. As health technology assessment processes become more sophisticated globally, treating market access as an essential strategic capability rather than a tactical exercise will be important for attracting investment and ultimately, successful drug development and commercialization.",Bacon C; Walker M; Ryan ML,Founder & CEO; Fingerpost Consulting,

However, due to the significant daily dosage of large volume parenteral (LVP), the detection limit for these products should be in the ng per liter range, which many published methods cannot achieve. This study aimed to develop and validate a sensitive LC-MS/MS method for the simultaneous determination of several nitrosamines in LVP drug products. Nitrosamines and related internal standards were separated on a Waters ACQUITY UPLC HSS T3 (100 × 2.1 mm, 1.8 µm) column on a LC-MS/MS system with gradient elution. Prior to the LC injection, a Carbon A solid phase extraction (SPE) column was utilized to pretreat the test solutions. The mobile phase was composed of 0.1% formic acid in water as mobile phase A, and neat methanol as mobile phase B. Analytes were detected via multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode and quantitated against internal reference standards with a quantitation limit of 2.5 ng/L for N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA), 0.75 ng/L for other Nitrosamine analytes. The LC-MS/MS method was able to separate all analytes of interest by gradient elution within 15 min. The method was validated according to the guidelines described in the International Conference on Harmonization guideline ICH Q2(R2). The LOQ for NMDA is 2.5 ng/L, while for other nitrosamines, it is 0.75 ng/L in peritoneal dialysis and saline matrices. For haemofiltration solution, the LOQ is 1.0 ng/L for NDMA and 0.3 ng/L for other nitrosamines. The RSD% (n = 9) of the recovery did not exceed 25% in the method accuracy evaluation. A comparative testing in three labs revealed that all three laboratories are capable of accurately measuring nitrosamine levels at 10 ng/L within the intricate LVP matrix. The LC-MS/MS method for several nitrosamines was successfully developed, validated, and demonstrated to be accurate, robust, and specific.

To elucidate the resistance mechanism of B. cinerea to pyrimethanil, transcriptomic comparisons were conducted between resistant (HRG21) and sensitive (FSG43) strains following exposure to pyrimethanil for 2 and 6 h. GO and KEGG analyses identified differential expression of genes associated with ABC and MFS transporters as well as methionine biosynthesis. qRT-PCR validation confirmed a marked upregulation of ABC (BcatrA, BcatrB, BcatrD, BcatrO, and Bmr3) and MFS (Bchex1 and BcmfsM2) transporter genes in HRG21, whereas in FSG43, ABC (BcatrA, BcatrB, BcatrD, and BcatrO) and MFS (Bchex1) transporter genes were downregulated. No significant transcriptional changes were observed in Mrr1, a transcription factor gene, following pyrimethanil exposure. Molecular docking analysis identified potential binding sites and interaction targets for five key transporters (BcatrB, BcatrA, BcatrD, Bmr3, and Bchex1). Furthermore, exogenous methionine supplementation partially mitigated pyrimethanil toxicity in FSG43. However, amino acid sequences of enzymes involved in methionine biosynthesis (BcmetC, BcStr2, Bcmet2, Bcmxr1, and Bcmxr2) exhibited no variation between FSG43 and HRG21.

The properties of nanopesticides make their drift and environmental behavior more unpredictable than traditional formulations. Our aim was to compare the ecotoxicity of two insecticides with λ-cyhalothrin as a.i.: a nano-based one and a traditional emulsified, considering the incidence of temperature according to climate change prospections (20 and 24 °C). We evaluated their effects on Daphnia magna survival, body stores, and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) activity. Although after 24 h the traditional formulation had greater lethality than the nanopesticide, after 48 h this pattern was reversed. At 24 °C the lethality of both pesticides increased. BChE activity was inhibited at 24 °C by both pesticides. In general, the increase in temperature negatively affected protein and glycogen content. The traditional formulation reduced glycogen content at 24 °C. A decrease in lipid content and the whole energy budget was observed in organisms exposed to the traditional formulation at both temperatures. Although the nano-based pesticide developed a delayed toxicity, it was more lethal than the traditional one in the long term. The temperature rise worsened the pesticides effects in terms of decreased survival, BChE activity inhibition, and energy reserves depletion. The development and regulation of new eco-safer nanopesticides needs to be complemented by their ecotoxicological assessment.

However, due to the lack of sensitive and reliable analytical method, the in vivo clearance and biotransformation of EGME and MAA is poorly understood. In order to evaluate their toxicokinetic profiles, a precolumn derivatization liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method was developed and validated for the simultaneous determination of EGME and MAA in rat plasma. After a simple protein precipitation procedure, the sample was derivatized with p-toluene sulfonyl isocyanate (PTSI) and 4-bromo-N-methylbenzylamine (4-BNMA), separated by gradient elution on HSS T3 column, and detected by electrospray ionization (ESI) source in positive multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode. The results of the method validation showed that EGME had good linearity in the range of 2.00-400 ng/mL and MAA in the range of 5.00-1000 ng/mL.

The ehimensin F6 was applied to the fresh mycelia of P. expansum at varying concentrations of 0MIC, 0.5MIC, 1MIC, and 2MIC (final concentration) to evaluate its effects on the cell wall, cell membrane, genomic DNA, and proteins of P. expansum mycelia. In addition, cherries were divided into four groups: treated with sterile water, low/high concentrations of ehimensin F6, or potassium sorbate. All were inoculated with P. expansum, stored at 25 °C for 5 days, and evaluated for antifungal effects by measuring lesion diameters and viable counts of P. expansum. The results demonstrated that ehimensin F6 obviously inhibited the growth of P. expansum in a dose-dependent manner.

Herein, a recombinant antisulfonylureas (SUs) single-chain variable fragment (scFv), which retained the properties of its parental monoclonal antibody, was successfully generated. X-ray crystallography, molecular docking, functional assays, and mutation validation were used to investigate the structure-function relationships underlying antibody-SUs binding. Our study revealed three key mechanisms for broad specificity: (1) the conformational adaptability of the scFv, which enabled various SUs to access the binding pocket; (2) the role of the Trp98 residue in CDR-L3 in modulating binding affinities among multiple SUs; and (3) the design of haptens with common structures and more rigid R substituents, which emerged as a promising strategy for generating broad-specific antibodies. This study provides a comprehensive analysis of the broad-specific recognition mechanism, offering valuable insights for rational hapten design and targeted antibody evolution to advance multitarget immunoassays.",,,

With increasing awareness of its significance and attempts to share best practices, here we aimed to understand how pharmacological profiling is implemented and reported in the primary literature by analyzing the representation of nonkinase enzymes in selectivity screens. This aspect has been overlooked in previous publications, despite enzymes constituting a significant portion of the pharmacological targets for currently marketed drugs. Our analysis shows that while industry recommendations for improved pharmacological profiling have been widely adopted, enzymes remain largely underrepresented: about a quarter of studies did not include enzymes, and on average, enzymes comprise only 11% of all targets in pharmacological screens. We discuss possible reasons for this shortcoming and provide examples of critical enzymes missing from current screens. We conclude with the notion that selectivity screens should be expanded to include more enzymes to improve drug development and safety.",,,

On the basis of our RNA-Seq data and due to the potential role of sialic acid as a coreceptor, we investigated the function of sialic acid-binding Ig-like lectin 15 (Siglec-15) to determine its role as a receptor in PEDV infection. We found that Siglec-15 enhances PEDV infection by promoting viral adsorption to host cells. Coimmunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence assays revealed that Siglec-15 binds to the S1 subunit and M protein of PEDV. PEDV infectivity was significantly reduced in Siglec-15 knockout mice. In addition, we developed a monoclonal antibody targeting Siglec-15 that can effectively inhibit PEDV infection both in vitro and in vivo.

Consequently, herds require adequate attention during cold, extended winters to alleviate cold stress and maintain profitability. This study investigated the effects of oregano essential oil (EO) on body weight (BW), well-being, blood parameters, and cecal microbiota. Eighteen steers were randomly divided into two groups (n = 9) and fed either a basal diet (CK) or the same diet supplemented with 20 g/(d·head) EO for 270 days. EO increased BW by increasing cecal microbial abundance and carbohydrate metabolism CAZymes, leading to elevated the total volatile fatty acids (VFA) levels. Cold stress activated the HPA axis, and mitigated stress by reducing serum levels of cortisol (COR), corticosterone (CORT), adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), and dopamine (DA). EO increased well-being by decreasing viral species without apparent contribution to drug or antibiotic resistance development, and cecal metabolites were primarily enriched in growth, carbohydrate metabolism, and amino acid metabolism pathways. Specifically, tryptophan metabolism (2-picolinic acid, quinolinic acid, and oxindole) enhanced steer well-being by increasing antioxidants (superoxide dismutase (SOD), peroxidases (POD), and glutathione (GSH)) and reducing inflammatory factors (interleukin-1β (IL-1β), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α)) following EO treatment. Notably, low-abundance microorganisms (s_Streptomyces_gardneri, s_Paenibacillus_sp._S09, and s_Nocardia_sp._Root136) may play a significant role in growth and immunity. These findings provide fundamental insights into how EO alleviates cold stress by modulating the HPA axis, promotes growth and well-being of steers under cold stress by influencing mediates tryptophan metabolism of cecal microbiota in Holstein steers.",Cheng S,China Resources Ng Fung,leizm@gsau.edu.cn.

Woody feed sources exhibit wide distribution and variety, containing a variety of bioactive substances such as flavonoids and alkaloids. Among these woody plants, Neolamarckia cadamba (Nc) has the characteristics of high leaf yield, fast growth rate, and rich nutritional value, which has great development potential. However, whether Nc supplementation can improve growth performance, immunity, and gut health of yellow-feathered broilers remains to be explored. In the present study, we aimed to investigate the effects of diet supplemented with dry powder or water extract of Nc on the growth performance, immunity, and intestinal health of yellow-feathered broilers. The results showed that, (1) There was no significant difference in Body weight (BW), Average daily gain (ADG), Average daily feed intake (ADFI), and Feed conversion ratio (FCR) between the Nc experimental groups and the control group (P > 0.05); (2) Compared to the control group, the thymus index at 63 days was significantly increased in the 1% Nc dry powder group (P < 0.05). Conversely, the bursa index of Fabricius was significantly decreased (P < 0.05) in the same group; (3) Compared to the control group and antibiotic group, there were no significant differences in the serum levels of albumin (ALB), globulin (GLB), total protein (TP), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and triglycerides (TG) in each experimental group (P > 0.05); (4) Compared to the control group, serum IgG levels were significantly increased in both the 1% Nc dry powder group and the 0.05% water extract group (P < 0.05); (5) Compared to the control group, 0.05% Nc water extract could significantly increase the mRNA expression levels of ZO-1 and TGF-β4 in the jejunum, as well as claudin-1, ZO-1, and TGF-β4 mRNA in the ileum(P < 0.05). Furthermore, the use of 1% Nc dry powder also resulted in a significant increase in the mRNA expression levels of TGF-β4 in the jejunum and ZO-1 mRNA in the ileum (P < 0.05). These results suggest that the dietary supplementation with Nc can enhance immune function, improve small intestinal barrier integrity, and reduce intestinal inflammation to a certain extent.

Peak lipase activity, growth rate, and inhibitory potential were observed at 48 h and 30 °C. Using Plackett-Burman and Central Composite Designs (PBD and CCD), whey, peptone, and agitation speed were identified as significant factors, achieving optimal lipase activity of 1314 U/mL and an inhibitory zone diameter (IZD) of 48 mm against S. aureus. Partial purification through ammonium sulfate precipitation and dialysis increased partial purified lipase (PPL) activity by twofold and fivefold, respectively. PPL exhibited effective bactericidal properties with a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimal bactericidal concentration (MBC) of 1/8 and 1/16, confirming a bactericidal effect (MIC/MBC ratio ≤ 2). Biofilm inhibition assays demonstrated 95% biofilm reduction at 80 µg/mL PPL, with SEM imaging revealing significant biofilm matrix disruption. Time-kill assays showed concentration-dependent bactericidal action, while inhibition of hemolysin and protease activities (25-100%) indicated reduced S. aureus pathogenicity. Cytotoxicity assays on normal liver cells showed an IC50 > 300 µg/mL, indicating low toxicity. GC/MS analysis of oil waste before degradation identified predominantly oleic acid 3-hydroxypropyl ester and octadecane derivatives, while after degradation, it revealed enriched free fatty acids including myristic, palmitic, linoleic, and oleic acids, which could enhance antimicrobial efficacy.

Understanding the specific mechanisms is essential for developing effective mitigation measure. However, most studies on phytotoxicity mechanism have focused on ionic balance and biochemical responses, with little consideration given to pesticide distributions within plants. Herein, symptoms and the underlying mechanisms of fosthiazate phytotoxicity to crops represented by tomatoes were investigated. Necrotic leaf edge and the root inhibition of tomato seedlings was observed after fosthiazate soil applied at the maximum registered dose. Given its high hydrophilicity, fosthiazate dissolved in soil solution was readily absorbed by plant roots and efficiently translocated upward via the transpiration stream, leading to varying concentrations across different organs and thus differential phytotoxicity. As fosthiazate accumulates, it induced plasmolysis, triggered reactive oxygen species (ROS) bursts, and disrupted photosynthesis, resulting in leaf wilting and necrotic. The interference of sucrose synthesis, transport and metabolism further inhibited root growth. Fosthiazate-loaded microcapsules could alleviate its phytotoxicity by slowing down the release rate.

A recent typing scheme has proposed several APEC pathotypes, including non-APEC, High Risk non-APEC (HR non-APEC), APEC, and High Risk APEC (HR APEC), based on the presence of the ompT and hlyF genes, sequence types (ST) ST131, ST23, ST428, ST355, and the O78 antigen. In Brazilian broiler farms, a higher prevalence of lesions in carcasses has been linked to the presence of HR APEC pathotypes. Due to the growing concern over antimicrobial resistance, bacteriophage-based formulations are emerging as a promising alternative for controlling APEC outbreaks. In this study, we isolated and sequenced 142 strains from Brazilian commercial broiler farms, classifying them as APEC (70), HR APEC (12), HR non-APEC (3) and non-APEC (57). Notably, 38 % of the isolates were classified as multi-drug resistant (MDR), with serotypes H10 and ST155 being the most frequently identified.

A cross-sector survey was developed to understand the current use of microsampling in toxicology studies, with the aim of identifying the specific studies in which microsampling was employed and the barriers to wider uptake. A high proportion of the survey responses indicated that microsampling was used, however, the extent varied widely. Some organisations use the technique only in non-GLP studies. Microsampling was used most for pharmacokinetics or toxicokinetics, commonly within small molecule and agrochemical toxicity studies, but less frequently within large molecule, cell/gene therapies or industrial chemical studies. A wide variety of barriers to wider use of microsampling were provided, typically around reticence to change from using larger samples, or not wishing to validate another bioanalytical method given the resources and challenges associated with the validation of a new technology. Despite these barriers, some organisations have adopted microsampling routinely across many/all rodent toxicity studies and there are opportunities to further reduce and refine animal use across all sectors by wider adoption of microsampling.",Prior H; Adedeji AO; Allen R; Angus D; Baker D; Blunt H; Coleman D; Dunmore HM; Passini E; Putnam T; Rosseels ML; Spooner N; Stewart J; Strepka C; Verhaeghe T; Wilson A; Sewell F,Labcorp; Charles River Laboratories; Boehringer Ingelheim; AstraZeneca; Genentech Inc; UCB BioPharma SRL; Syngenta; Sequani Ltd; J&J Innovative Medicine; ApconiX; Spooner Bioanalytical Solutions; National Centre for the Replacement,

Arginine (G) is a crucial amino acid for chickens and feeding on arginine beyond the recommended levels has been shown to positively impact the growth performance of broiler chickens and their immunity. Olive leaves phenolic extract (OLE) is a natural source of powerful antioxidants. The current study aimed to investigate the combined efficacy of these functional feed additives (G + OLE) in enhancing broilers' growth performance, immunity, and muscle development, as well as potentiating meat quality and antioxidant capacity during freezing. Broilers (n = 250) were randomly assigned into control (without supplementations) and four groups fed control diets plus 1.5 g/kg arginine alone (G) or with three different levels of OLE; 0.25%, 0.5% and 1% (G + OLEǀ, G + OLEǀǀǀ and G + OLEǀǀǀ, respectively). During whole rearing periods, G + OLE inclusion boosted efficacy on body weight gain, and feed conversion ratio in a dose-dependent manner. The postmortem pH values at 0.5, and 24 h, drip loss, and cooking loss % of meat were considerably minimized in G + OLE-supplied groups, especially at high levels. Even after 4 weeks of frozen storage, G + OLEǀǀǀ, G + OLEǀǀ groups exhibited the most prominent increase in the breast meat scavenging ability for free radicals (2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl, 2,2'-azino-bis (3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid, and ferric reducing antioxidant power) with an inverse minimization in lipid peroxidation attributes (malondialdehyde). Total flavonoid, and phenolic contents, total antioxidant capacity, and antioxidant enzymes' activities in the breast meat were significantly improved by increasing the concentrations of dietary G + OLE. Concordantly, upregulation of genes encoding immunity (immunoglobulins A, G and M), antioxidant enzymes (catalase, superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, peroxiredoxin-1, heme oxygenase-1, NAD(P)H dehydrogenase quinone 1, xanthine oxidoreductase, and heme oxygenase 1), and muscle development (myogenic determination factor, myogenin and mammalian target of rapamycin), and downregulation of myostatin, were remarkably recognized in G + OLE-supplied groups.

Nonetheless, the precise mechanisms underlying its effects are yet to be fully elucidated. In this study, we aim to explore the role and potential mechanism of HE in treating COPD using network pharmacology, molecular docking and experimental validation. We screened for HE and COPD-related targets from public databases, and then imported potential targets into a STRING database to establish a protein-protein interaction network. Gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes enrichment analysis were performed to obtain key signaling pathways. We then predicted the binding interactions between HE and core targets using molecular docking. The animal model of COPD was established through lipopolysaccharide and cigarette smoke induction in mice to observe lung function, inflammatory factors, pathology, and the expression of related proteins. Network pharmacology findings unveiled that HE and COPD shared 105 common targets. MAPKs and NF-κB signaling pathways were selected for further validation. In animal experiment, HE enhanced lung function and histopathological morphology, while reducing inflammation levels. The results of Western blot tests indicated that HE treatment considerably inhibited the expression of MAPKs and NF-κB. HE effectively reduced lung inflammation and improved lung function in mice.

Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO1), a key enzyme in the catabolism of tryptophan through kynurenine pathway, participates in the development of multiple tumor types. However, the role of IDO1 in tumor ferroptosis is unclear. In this study, we identified IDO1 as a key regulator of ferroptosis in lung cancer. With Erastin-treated lung cancer cells, we found that IDO1 inhibited ferroptosis, reduced the generation of lipid peroxide and ROS. Mechanistically, IDO1 promoted the expression of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF2) through activating aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) pathway. IDO1 up-regulated the expression of solute carrier family 7 member 11 (SLC7A11) and the activity of pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) via AhR-NRF2 axis, promoted the production of reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) and glutathione (GSH), thereby inhibiting ferroptosis. Moreover, combined treatment with IDO1 inhibitor and Erastin inhibited tumor growth, down-regulated SLC7A11 expression and PPP activity, promoted tumor ferroptosis in lung cancer-bearing mice. In conclusion, this study revealed the function of IDO1 in lung cancer ferroptosis and provided a new strategy for lung cancer therapy.",,,yanglili@tjmuch.com.

Many contemporary studies employ sequential generative models. Their standard training method is to sequentialize molecular graphs into ordered sequences and then maximize the likelihood of the resulting sequences. However, the exact likelihood is computationally intractable, which involves a sum over all possible sequential orders. Molecular graphs lack an inherent order and the number of orders is factorial in the graph size. To avoid the intractable full space of factorially-many orders, existing works pre-define a fixed node ordering scheme such as depth-first search to sequentialize the 3D molecular graphs. In these cases, the training objectives are loose lower bounds of the exact likelihoods which are suboptimal for generation. To address the challenges, we propose a unified generative framework named MolEM to learn the 3D molecular graphs and corresponding sequential orders jointly. We derive a tight lower bound of the likelihood and maximize it via variational expectation-maximization algorithm, opening a new line of research in learning-based ordering schemes for 3D molecular graph generation. Besides, we first incorporate the molecular docking method QuickVina 2 to manipulate the binding poses, leading to accurate and flexible ligand conformations. Experimental results demonstrate that MolEM significantly outperforms baseline models in generating molecules with high binding affinities and realistic structures. Our approach efficiently approximates the true marginal graph likelihood and identifies reasonable orderings for 3D molecular graphs, aligning well with relevant chemical priors.",,,

Furthermore, network pharmacology was applied to dissect the possible targets and biological pathways regulated by ESW. The plasma and fecal metabolomics were comprehensively analyzed by UPLC-Q-TOF/MS. Subsequently, an efficient and feasible approach integrating network pharmacology, metabolomics, and molecular docking was used to explore the key targets obtained from the metabolite-reaction-enzyme-gene network. And the effect of ESW on the MAPK signaling mediated intestinal epithelial cell apoptosis was further investigated by in vitro and in vivo experiments. ESW could notably alleviate colon injury and inflammation of UC mice. Network pharmacology suggested that the bioactive components of ESW could mainly modulate signaling pathways associated with inflammation and metabolism. Consistently, plasma and fecal metabolomics further indicated that ESW could regulate the metabolic pathways of arachidonic acid, linoleic acid, sphingolipid, tryptophan, and glycerophospholipid. And the combined analysis of network pharmacology and metabolomics revealed that 14 pivotal targets were modulated by ESW, including PTGS1, PTGS2, CYP1A1, FADS1, CBR1, ALOX5, EPHX1, EPHX2, HPGD, PLA2G1B, PLA2G7, MGLL, ACHE, and SPHK1. Additionally, molecular docking suggested that bioactive components of ESW could bind well to these potential targets. And in vitro and in vivo experiments further verified that ESW could markedly ameliorate pathological symptoms of UC mice through inhibiting MAPK signaling mediated colonic epithelial cell apoptosis. Collectively, these findings indicated that ESW could effectively alleviate the pathological symptoms of UC mice, mainly involving in the modulation of lipid and amino acid metabolism pathways, and the suppression of MAPK signaling-mediated apoptosis. In this study, the potential mechanism of ESW for the treatment of UC was first clarified, which provided a solid scientific foundation for its clinical application. Notably, the proposed strategy facilitated a comprehensive prediction and validation of the efficacy and molecular mechanism of TCMs, and also provided a novel approach for revealing the intricate biological pathogenesis of diseases.",,,jiangshu2020@126.com.

The etiology of the disease remains unclear, which currently hinders the development of effective therapeutic drugs and interventions. Ingenol (Ing), a terpenoid active ingredient found in plants of the Euphorbiaceae family, including the entire herb of Euphorbia helioscopia, Euphorbia kansui, or Euphorbia lathyris, demonstrates significant anti-inflammatory and antiviral activities. In this study, we identified and confirmed that Ingenol can significantly ameliorate silicosis induced by silica dioxide by inhibiting the PTGS2/PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. In vivo, Ingenol improves pulmonary respiratory function and reduces inflammation and fibrosis in a murine model of CS-induced silicosis. In vitro, Ingenol inhibits the expression of cellular factors associated with inflammation and fibrosis, as well as macrophage apoptosis and fibroblast migration. Furthermore, it can modulate the expression of fibrosis-related proteins, thereby inhibiting CS-induced fibrotic responses. Mechanistically, a combination of bioinformatics, network pharmacology, and experimental validation indicates that Ingenol mitigates the progression of silicosis by modulating the PTGS2/PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. In summary, these findings suggest that Ingenol is a potential candidate for the treatment of silicosis.",,,by0319_cpu@163.com.

The effects of EDs can be predicted by integrating both toxicokinetic (TK) and toxicodynamic (TD) processes in order to relate adverse outcomes to external exposures. In this study, we developed a physiologically based kinetic-toxicodynamic model to simulate the disruption of the HPG axis (PBK-TD, hereafter named PBK-HPG) in female zebrafish exposed to either of two aromatase inhibitors, imazalil or prochloraz. The model was calibrated using Bayesian methods and supported by novel experimental data, including measurements of vitellogenin, 17β-estradiol, and 11-ketotestosterone levels, along with in vivo monitoring of the cyp19a1a gene in transgenic cyp19a1a-GFP ebrafish. Seamless integration of a PBK model within a TD model of the HPG-axis, provided the link between external exposure and internal levels of imazalil and prochloraz in key organs, allowing for mechanistic predictions of their inhibitory effects on gonadal aromatase. Our PBK-HPG model accurately predicted both baseline homeostasis and the effects of aromatase inhibition, with all endocrine endpoints including reproductive disruption, i.e., decreased egg production, falling within a twofold range of both experimental and literature data. Therefore, our PBK-HPG model could further support the development of a mechanistic qAOP with TK considerations.

Evaluating their environmental effects is critical for ensuring their sustainable use. In this study, we aimed to assess the ecotoxicity of TEMPO-CNFs on Daphnia magna reproduction and explore mechanisms underlying observed effects. Reproductive toxicity was evaluated according to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development test guideline, determining the no observed effect concentration (NOEC) and 10 % effect concentration (EC10). Mechanistic insights were investigated through water chemistry analyses, a feeding inhibition test, a gut evacuation experiment, and 10-day life table experiments. The NOEC and EC10 for TEMPO-CNFs were 12.5 mg/L and 3.4 mg/L, respectively. Results supported the dilution-effect hypothesis, indicating reduced availability of essential food, such as Chlorella, as a driver of toxicity. Gut evacuation experiments indicated that TEMPO-CNFs in D. magna individuals were excreted within 24 h when they were transferred to a CNF-free environment. The results suggest that TEMPO-CNFs are unlikely to impact D. magna reproduction unless exposure is continuous and at high concentrations.

This study investigates the effects of exposure to the androgen nandrolone on sex differentiation, gonadal development, and the expression of hormones, enzymes, and proteins related to the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis in zebrafish. The results indicate that exposure to nandrolone at 60 days post-fertilization promotes the maturation of spermatogonia, inhibits the development of oocytes, and induces their apoptosis. Additionally, there were dose-dependent changes in male differentiation and hormone levels within the HPG axis: in the high-dose group (5 μg/L), males constituted 73 % of the population, and levels of E2 hormones in gonadal tissues decreased by 33 %, while T hormone levels increased by 55 %. Furthermore, the expression of genes essential for ovarian differentiation were downregulated, whereas the expression of testicular differentiation-related genes were upregulated. The molecular docking results show that the drug can form hydrogen bonds with key proteins, which have high affinity, and are more likely to cause conformational changes in the proteins, thereby altering their activity.

Plant trichomes serve as critical sequestration organs for HVs; however, the different roles of glandular trichomes (GTs) and non-glandular trichomes (NGTs) in the process of detoxification remain elusive. In this study, two interacting proteins (NtHD9 and NtJAZ10) with opposite effects on glandular head formation in GTs were individually targeted for knockout in Nicotiana tabacum cv. K326: NtJAZ10 mutants (LK326) had dominant long-stalk glandular trichomes (LGTs), whereas NtHD9 mutants (NK326) had dominant NGTs. Phytohormone content measurements and subsequent hormone supplementation assays in LK326 and NK326 suggested that the NtJAZ10-NtHD9 module regulated LGT head formation via jasmonate signaling. Both LGTs and NGTs were Cd sequestration sites, but showed different Cd detoxification mechanisms; NGTs compartmentalized Cd in the vacuole, whereas LGTs promoted the cytosol-to-cell wall translocation of Cd, facilitating Cd excretion. LK326 further exhibited strong Cd stress tolerance, which was confirmed by elevated abscisic acid (ABA) levels, strengthened antioxidant systems, and heightened photosynthetic abilities. To understand the molecular mechanisms underlying Cd detoxification in trichomes, LK326 and NK326 trichomes were used for comparative RNA sequencing analysis, which revealed 18 genes that may be involved in Cd absorption and transport. Our findings suggest that JAZ10 is an ideal candidate gene for enhancing Cd stress tolerance by promoting the development of LGT glandular heads and increasing ABA levels in plants.

Coumarin derivatives, plant secondary metabolites, possess anti-inflammatory properties, but their specific role in AD treatment remain unclear. This study investigated the therapeutic potential of 7-geranyloxycoumarin (C#6), a selective coumarin derivative, in alleviating AD-like symptoms through multifaceted mechanisms. Among various coumarin derivatives tested, C#6 demonstrated remarkable efficacy in both in vitro and in vivo models. Notably, C#6 significantly suppressed interleukin-8 and thymic stromal lymphopoietin production in stimulated HaCaT cells. Experiments on an MC903-induced mouse model of AD revealed that topical administration of C#6 for 10 days led to a significant reduction in ear and epidermal thickness. Flow cytometry analysis showed a significant decrease in CD45 + leukocytes, eosinophils, and Th2 cells in C#6-treated AD mice. Importantly, 16S rRNA sequencing indicated that C#6 restored the disrupted skin microbiome by increasing the abundance of beneficial Lactobacillus and reducing pathogenic bacteria such as Enterobacteriaceae, Corynebacteriaceae, and Corynebacterium, contributing to maintaining skin microbiome balance. Molecular docking studies revealed high binding affinities of C#6 to key regulators, including NOD1, TLR2, PAR2, and TLR3, suggesting a role in modulating critical inflammatory pathways. Additionally, co-culture experiments revealed that C#6 treatment of TNF-α and IFN-γ-stimulated HaCaT cells suppressed inflammatory cytokines expression by THP-1 cells.

To validate our hepatotoxicity prediction model, we selected 12 hepatotoxic reference compounds. As indicators, we used factors related to mechanisms of hepatotoxicity and markers thereof, including factors related to oxidative stress and proinflammatory cytokines. We plotted radar graphs and calculated the relative areas of polygons to analyze the effects of drugs with different degrees of hepatotoxicity. The drugs in the severe DILI group significantly increased the levels of factors related to oxidative stress (ROS, GSSH, and catalase) compared to those in the no and mild DILI groups. The drugs in the severe group significantly increased the levels of inflammation-related factors (IL-1, IL-6, and IL-10). The drugs in the mild and severe groups highly significantly increased the activities of ALT and AST and the level of ALB compared to those in the no DILI group.

Despite significant advancements and several successful case studies of utilizing PBPK models in generic drug development, developing patient-centric dissolution quality standards using PBPK modeling that account for food effects or different disease states remains challenging. Combining multiple dissolution studies at different pH ranges can aid in developing patient-centric dissolution specifications. Additionally, a major challenge for GI locally acting drug products is the inability to validate the PBPK model for local bioavailability due to the lack of measured data for local drug concentration along the different sections of the GI tract. A totality of evidence-based approach, taking account of all available data in addition to PBPK modeling-based evidence, should be considered.

Despite expectations of price drops, many OMPs seem to lack competition after exclusivity. This study examines OMP price trends and the entry of generics/biosimilars in The Netherlands. OMPs authorized before January 1, 2010, were included unless they had active substance patents or were withdrawn before the end of market exclusivity. Data on European generic/biosimilar authorization were gathered from the European Medicines Agency and Dutch Medicines Evaluation Board. List price data were collected from the Dutch national database. Twenty-eight small molecules and 9 biologicals were included in the primary analysis, all authorized between 14.0 to 22.3 years. The median of their most recent prices in The Netherlands was 81% of the initial price (range 11%-104%). Eleven small molecule (39%) and 8 biological (89%) OMPs did not have a generic/biosimilar registered. If generic/biosimilar entry did occur, this was after a median of 14.2 years (range 11.5-20.3 years). Median prices of OMPs with generic/biosimilar competition were lower than those without (to 66% vs 88% of the initial price, respectively, P < .01). Postexclusivity competition and subsequent price decrease is limited for OMPs. First, generics/biosimilars for OMPs enter later than non-OMPs. Second, for some OMPs (especially biologicals), there is no competition at all. Third, prices of OMPs with generic/biosimilar competition decreased only minimally compared with non-OMPs. New policies are needed to correct this apparent market failure.",,,s.j.devisser@amsterdamumc.nl.

However, transitioning to continuous manufacturing in process development is challenging due to the need for early adoption of industrial-scale equipment. Conversely, batch processes require extensive scale-up studies before commercialization, which continuous processes can avoid. A more efficient approach is to use batch trials in early development to design formulations and processes for continuous manufacturing, requiring assessment of their transferability. This study compares the dissolution behavior of immediate-release tablets manufactured via batch and Continuous Direct Compression (CDC), using ibuprofen, a BCS Class II drug. A Design of Experiments (DoE) approach varied formulation properties and tensile strength, with three methods: i) similarity factor ([f2]), ii) Weibull model fitting and Partial Least Squares (PLS) regression, and iii) Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) to assess the transferability of batch trial data and dissolution models for CDC formulation and process design. Dissolution profiles were identical between batch and CDC trials when formulations and tensile strength matched, with differences observed only due to deviations in actual tensile strength. The PLS model indicated minimal impact of operational modes on dissolution behavior. The GPR model based only on batch trial data predicted CDC dissolution profiles with a mean R",Verrecas H; da Silva AFT; Anderson A; Wikström H; Dumarey M; Mann J,Oral Product Development; Discovery,pharmaeng@ugent.be.

Intensified agriculture is often associated with increased use of pesticides and the use of pesticides could negatively impact also non-target species living in the vicinity of agricultural lands. We exposed larvae of the Glanville fritillary butterfly (Melitaea cinxia) to a short-term exposure of a herbicide, a fungicide, or a mix of the two via their larval host plant (Plantago lanceolata). Survival and performance of the larvae was recorded and potential carry-over effects on adult butterfly fitness traits were assessed under semi-natural conditions in an outdoor enclosure. Our results showed significantly higher mortality of 60 % in the larvae exposed to the fungicide and 22 % mortality in the fungicide-herbicide mix treatment, with both treatments also impacting adult morphology. Adult female butterflies exposed to the mix of fungicide and herbicide treatment during their development also had lower lifetime reproductive success than the other treatment groups, suggesting that the combined chemical load had stronger carry-over effects into adulthood. Our results demonstrate clear negative impacts of a commonly used fungicide on a non-target butterfly species. The combined effect of two pesticides, while less lethal to larvae directly, seem to have a more profound carry-over impact on fitness of adult female butterflies. The mechanisms underlying the effects of a fungicide alone and in interaction with the herbicide, as well as the relatively minor impacts of herbicide alone on the specialist insect warrant further investigation in the role of pesticides in natural populations.",de Koning M,Applied Biology,ulla.riihimaki@helsinki.fi.

Given its stable presence in aquatic environments, long-term exposure of wild fish may pose a risk to offspring embryonic development. This study demonstrated that exposure of zebrafish to environmental concentrations of difenoconazole throughout their life cycle resulted in abnormal development of offspring embryos/larvae, including decreased heart rate, delayed hatching, increased malformation rate, shortened body length, and increased mortality. These changes were significantly correlated with the affected apoptosis, autophagy, energy metabolism and MAPK signaling pathways in F1 generation. This transgenerational toxic effect results from epigenetic alterations in gametes, impaired nutrient supply from the ovum, and maternal transfer of difenoconazole. After exposure to difenoconazole, the development of female fish offspring was affected more than that of male fish offspring, which was mainly caused by the impaired nutrient supply from the ovum and the maternal transfer of difenoconazole. Because this transgenerational developmental toxicity was observed at environmental levels, difenoconazole may pose a threat to the survival of wild larvae and therefore a risk to wild fish populations.",,,

The MSMS spectral library was generated to create a database consisting of 1087 pesticides based on authentic pesticide standards. The retention time (±0.5 min), precursor ion (≤± 5 ppm), and product ions (≤± 5 ppm) were extracted for each pesticide from LC-FS MS/data-dependent MSMS acquisition (LC-FS MS/DDA MSMS). Mass accuracy criteria, along with ±0.1 min retention time tolerance, were used for the identification of pesticides. Three laboratories evaluated and validated the nDATA workflow to screen and identify pesticides from produce extracts (apples, bananas, broccoli, carrots, grapes, lettuce, oranges, potatoes, strawberry, and tomatoes) prepared by the Quick, Easy, Cheap, Effective, Rugged, and Safe (QuEChERS) procedure. Of the 1087 pesticides evaluated, false-positive rates were ≤5% for 977 pesticides in blank matrices and false-negative rates were ≤5% for 921 and 985 pesticides in fortified matrices at 10 and 100 μg/kg, respectively. False positives detected were misidentified pesticides, incurred residues, or contaminants possibly resulting from process or system contamination detected below the threshold level of 10 μg/kg. False negatives were attributed to pesticides that did not sufficiently ionize or fragment or had poor stabilities and QuEChERS extraction efficiencies. Incurred residues in archived produce samples (apple, Chinese broccoli, grape, kale, kohlrabi, orange, pepper, strawberry, tomato, and turnip green) were prepared using QuEChERS, evaluated by the nDATA workflow, and the results were compared and confirmed, if possible, to targeted GC-MS/MS, LC-MS/MS, and LC-FS MS/DDA MSMS methods. The three laboratories identified 25 parent pesticides at levels >10 μg/kg that were consistent with findings from targeted procedures and discovered 10 different metabolites that were not provided in the multiple reaction monitoring method or inclusion list of the targeted procedures. GC-MS/MS identified two pesticides, chlorothalonil and dacthal, and a possible chlorothalonil metabolite, pentachlorobenzonitrile, that were not amenable to LC-low or LC-high-resolution mass spectrometry analysis in produce samples. To improve the identification quality, the nDATA workflow further implemented quality control, operational, and processing measures to reduce the number of false detects, and the data evaluation workload. As demonstrated in this study, the validated nDATA workflow creates new opportunities for chemical residues analysis, offering a potential screening complement to targeted LC-MS/MS, GC-MS/MS, and nontargeted methods for pesticides and other contaminants of interest.",,,

However, developing HPLC methods is material- and time-consuming, so computer-aided shortcuts are highly desirable. In line with the digitalization of process development and the growth of HPLC databases, we propose a data-driven methodology to predict molecule retention factors as a function of mobile phase composition without the need for any new experiments, solely relying on molecular descriptors (MDs) obtained via simplified molecular input line entry system (SMILES) string representations of molecules. This new approach combines: (a) quantitative structure-property relationships (QSPR) using MDs to predict solute-dependent parameters in (b) linear solvation energy relationships (LSER) and (c) linear solvent strength (LSS) theory. We demonstrate the potential of this computational methodology using experimental data for retention factors of small molecules made available by the research community for which the MDs were obtained via SMILES string representations determined by the structural formulas of the molecules. This method can be adopted directly to predict elution times of molecular components; however, in combination with first-principle-based mechanistic transport models, the method can also be employed to optimize HPLC methods in-silico. Both options can reduce the experimental load and accelerate HPLC method development significantly, lowering the time and cost of the drug manufacturing cycle and reducing the time to market. Given the growing number and quality of HPLC databases, the predictive power of this methodology will only increase in the coming years.",,,

By using ultra-performance liquid chromatography (UPLC)-quadrupole-time-of-flight (QTOF)-tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS), the components of HDT that can enter the circulatory system were found, aiming to investigate its active constituents with pharmacological effects. Based on network pharmacology approaches, the relevant HDT targets in the therapy of hyperlipidemia were anticipated. The possible mechanism of HDT for hyperlipidemia treatment was verified by  UPLC-QTOF-MS/MS identified 30 components of HDT entering the circulatory system, primarily consisting of flavonoids, diterpenoids and alkaloids. The results of a network pharmacology study revealed that 30 active components mostly target 74 genes associated with hyperlipidemia. The primary active ingredients may include quercetin, kaempferol, and epicatechin, and the main gene targets may be tumor necrosis factor (TNF), interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin 1 beta (IL-1β), etc. The results of animal experiments demonstrated that HDT can significantly regulate the blood lipid level in rats with HFD, improve the degree of inflammatory infiltration in rat liver cells, lower TNF-α, C-reactive protein (CRP), IL-6, matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9) and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels while raising total superoxide dismutase (T-SOD) level. Meanwhile, HDT can considerably lower the expression of sterol regulatory element-binding transcription factor 2 (SREBF2), 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase (HMGCR), and MMP9 while significantly increasing the expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPAR-α) and PPAR-γ.  The mechanism by which HDT treats hyperlipidemia involves modification of the lipid metabolism targets such as downregulating SREBF2, HMGCR and MMP9, and upregulating PPAR-α and PPAR-γ, as well as anti-inflammatory and antioxidant actions.

The pneumonia model was established by intraperitoneal injection of 5 mg/kg LPS in mice. Cytokines were detected by enzyme-linked immune-osorbent assay (ELISA), macrophages in lung tissue were determined by immunofluorescence, and pathway-related data were determined by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and Western blot. The liver, thymus, and spleen index values and the levels of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) obviously increased in LPS-treated mice. FZXF decreased the white blood cell count and reduced the increase in the lung wet weight/dry weight ratio caused by LPS. The hematoxylin-eosin staining result showed that FZXF could maintain the integrity of lung tissue structure, alleviate interstitial oedema and alveolar wall thickening, and reduce inflammatory cell infiltration. Moreover, FZXF markedly reduced the expression of proinflammatory cytokines. FZXF also significantly reduced LPS-induced malondialdehyde production and increased superoxide dismutase level in the lung. By immunofluorescence, we found that FZXF could reduce macrophage infiltration. The mRNA expression levels of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and nuclear transcription factor κB (NF-κB) in the lung tissue of mice were decreased by treatment with FZXF.

Mycobacteria, including Mycobacterium tuberculosis and non-tuberculous mycobacteria, can form biofilms that facilitate their survival in hostile environments and contribute to development of antibiotic resistance and responses by the host immune system. Mycobacterial biofilm development is a complex process involving multiple genetic determinants, notably mmpL genes, which regulate lipid transport and support cell wall integrity, and the groEL gene, which is essential for biofilm maturation. Sliding motility, a passive form of surface movement observed across various mycobacterial species, is closely associated with biofilm formation and colony morphology. The unique sliding motility and biofilm-forming capabilities of Mycobacterium spp. are pivotal for their pathogenicity and persistence in diverse environments. A comprehensive understanding of the regulatory mechanisms governing these processes is crucial for the development of novel therapeutic strategies against mycobacterial infections.

The heat removal and input in freezing, primary drying, and secondary drying are via contact between the product and shelves cooled or heated by a circulating working fluid such as silicone oil. This is slow, inefficient, and leads to non-uniform freezing and drying, especially in large-scale production systems. To address the current throughput limitations of conventional lyophilization, this collaborative project by Purdue University, Merck and IMA Life develops the next generation of tunable randomized-field microwave lyophilization system demonstrating significant acceleration over conventional freeze-drying processes. The system uses a microwave source delivering electromagnetic energy to the lyophilization chamber at frequencies between 8 GHz and 18 GHz at power levels below 400 W and mechanical stirrers for field randomization to achieve uniform heating. The frequency range is selected due to its greater efficiency for heating ice relative to traditional industrial microwave frequencies of 915 MHz and 2.45 GHz. During operation, temperature is measured directly using optical sensors, providing robust real-time product data. Closed-loop control algorithms enable direct control of the product temperature throughout the drying process, ensuring the material is dried at an optimal rate.

Unfortunately, soymilk lacks the powerful antioxidant vitamin E. Encapsulation of vitamin E and isoflavones in soymilk powder is advantageous for malnourished consumers to meet the recommendation. This study aimed to evaluate the impact of different encapsulation techniques and encapsulating materials on the storage stability and bioaccessibility of vitamin E and isoflavones in soymilk powder. Freeze-drying and spray-drying methods were applied with various encapsulating materials prepared from different ratios of maltodextrin to Acacia gum (100:0, 60:40, 50:50, 40:60, and 0:100). The results indicated that a 40:60 ratio of maltodextrin and Acacia gum provided the highest stability for 24 h of soymilk emulsion under the studied conditions. The shelf-life prediction of soymilk powder increased by more than two weeks when stored at 0 °C compared to the storage at ambient temperature. Spray-drying and freeze-drying techniques effectively encapsulate vitamin E and isoflavones within core microcapsules. Especially, freeze-drying process helps to prevent degradation during storage and allows for controlled release of the bioactive compounds during in-vitro digestion. Encapsulation efficiency of isoflavones and vitamin E for all formulation ranged from 80.9 ± 0.01% to 83.5 ± 0.20%, respectively. The highest vitamin E and isoflavones bioaccessibility of encapsulated product increased by up to 4.4-fold and 1.7-fold in the 60:40 formulations. Consuming 20 g of encapsulated vitamin E and 170 g of encapsulated isoflavones daily would be sufficient to meet the recommended intake.",Avallone S,Qualisud,wichien.s@cmu.ac.th.

B115 is a strain of beneficial microorganisms present in the inter-root zone of plants, with favorable plant growth-promoting properties and antagonistic effects against the plant pathogen Fusarium oxysporum. However, the whole genome of B115 remains unclear, thus restricting its potential applications. To address this gap, the whole genome of B115 has been sequenced and annotated to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying its plant growth-promoting and antimicrobial activities. The genome analysis revealed that B115 comprises a single circular chromosome of 4,200,774 bp and a plasmid region 16,878 bp long, possessing a GC content of 45.95%. Moreover, 4349 protein-coding genes were predicted. Notably, the B115 genome contains a substantial number of genes (103) involved in the biosynthesis, transport, and catabolism of secondary metabolites. Through genome mining, 13 BGCs and 540 genes encoding secondary metabolites with predicted roles were identified, including members of the surfactin and fengycin families. Utilizing LC-MS/MS technologies, 2318 metabolites were detected in the fermentation broth of B. velezensis B115, encompassing compounds such as Corynebactin, Gamabufotalin, Pracinostat, Indoleacetic acid, (8)-Gingerol, Luteolin, Liquiritigenin, and other metabolites with antimicrobial, growth-promoting, antioxidant, and antitumor properties. By exploring secondary metabolite-related genes and predicting potential secondary metabolites from the B115 genome based on the whole-genome sequence results, we further elucidate the genomic basis for its ability to promote plant growth and inhibit pathogen activity.",Duan X; Zhou L; Li Z; Yu J,Tobacco Leaf Quality Inspection Section; Yunnan Tobacco Company,2332710778@qq.com.

Current LNP production methods have the limit of generating low polydispersity index (PDI; PDI < 0.1) only for relatively small particles (<100 nm). It is known that larger LNPs have desirable properties, for example, particles with diameters in the 100 to 200 nm range have good immunogenicity. Yet, these larger particles' large PDI limits their clinical translation because of concerns about manufacturing reproducibility and possible side effects. We report here a facile approach to produce large and monodisperse (100-200 nm, PDI < 0.1) LNPs. The approach is based on adding 10 kDa polyethylene glycol (PEG) to a solution containing smaller LNPs. We show that PEG-induced depletion forces lead to the fusion of LNPs to form particles of approximately double the original size while keeping the same starting PDI. We discuss the fusion mechanism and show the parameters it depends on. In particular, we show that the fusion leads to a decrease in the fraction of empty LNPs. We show that the purification for PEG after fusion is simple and complete, thus, we believe that this is a method for the production of large LNP with low PDI that has a lot of potential to find industrial use.",,,francesco.stellacci@epfl.ch.

Since they first appeared in the late 1980s, a rapidly growing market has developed. This study aims to analyze concentration levels in the market for mAb innovations through a quantitative patent analysis. Data were analyzed using traditional concentration indicators such as the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index and Concentration Ratio, as well as linear regression and kernel density graphs to evaluate innovation and global technology dissemination strategies. The starting point was patents associated with mAbs registered by the FDA and identified in the IQVIA database up until 2019, and supplemented by data from The Antibody Society, Purple Book, Orange Book, and FDA. Our findings indicate that the market for mAb innovations is moderately concentrated for general patents and unconcentrated for priority patents. However, it is significantly more concentrated than the market for chemical drug innovations. The mAb patent families tend to generate more progeny patents, although they are deposited in fewer countries. Chemical drug patents spread faster. Some companies seem to be central to the development of mAbs worldwide, including Roche, PDL, City of Hope, and Celltech. Other important players in the mAb innovation market are AbbVie, Amgen, Novartis, GSK, Biogen, BMS, Regeneron, J&J, and AstraZeneca. The most relevant patents in the analysis are associated with methods and procedures to obtain mAbs, not with molecules themselves. The concentration in the mAb innovation market is higher than the concentration in the market for chemical drugs innovations. Our findings also indicate that expertise in mAbs development and production is concentrated in a few countries. Additionally, our study identified that a few key players from high-income countries are driving innovation in the mAb market.",,,

Morbidity and mortality weekly report,10.15585/mmwr.mm7410a3,"The proportion of synthetic opioid overdose deaths co-involving stimulants has increased in the United States in recent years. Although persons who use opioids have reported increasing stimulant co-use to maintain workplace productivity and alertness, occupational patterns of co-involvement in fatal overdose have not been systematically investigated. In an exploratory study, data on overdose deaths involving synthetic opioids (e.g., fentanyl) from the 2022 National Vital Statistics System were analyzed to characterize patterns of stimulant co-involvement among U.S. residents aged 15-64 years, stratified by decedents' usual occupation and industry. Of 69,893 fatal synthetic opioid overdoses, 53.6% involved stimulants. Occupation and industry groups with the highest percentages of synthetic opioid overdose deaths co-involving psychostimulants with abuse potential (psychostimulants) were typically physically demanding (e.g., construction and extraction occupations), whereas categories with highest percentages of cocaine co-involvement were generally less physically strenuous (e.g., business and financial occupations); these patterns might reflect differences in desired drug effects, cost, and geographic availability. Work-related interventions might be useful in preventing the development of substance use disorder by decreasing rates of occupational injuries and workplace stress, connecting workers with substance use disorder to treatment resources, and reducing fatal overdose through harm reduction.",Lundstrom EW; Macmadu A; Steege AL; Groenewold M,,

Existing policy simulations have tried to assess the policy impacts on innovation based on either empirical estimates of elasticity of innovation from the literature or structural models estimating the joint distribution of expected revenue and expected costs at key stages of pharmaceutical development. Since investors exert significant influence on investment programs that companies advance in the real world, a program-level analysis of how investors make their investment decisions can inform the key assumptions for policy simulations and generate more realistic insights. Using an illustrative case example, we constructed a net present value (NPV) model to examine how Medicare price negotiation will impact discounted value and investment decisions at six key timepoints of new drug development, highlighting key factors in investor decision-making not explicitly considered in existing empirical literature or policy simulations. Our analyses showed that IRA would lead to a 40% reduction in the NPV at the time of launch. The reduction was greater in earlier stages of development due to expected dilution and discounting, resulting in discontinuing this project at earlier decision points. The case study demonstrated that the negative impacts of price negotiation at nine years were more pronounced for small-molecule assets in the earlier stages of development (e.g., preclinical or Phase 1) than those in the later stages, implying a possibly much larger impact on innovation than suggested by existing empirical literature and observed in the short term.",Xie RZ; Cameron T; Kolchinsky P,RA Capital Management,rxie@racap.com.

However, due to an extended exposure duration needed for an antibacterial effect, the utilization of a photosensitizer (PS) to increase the efficacy of the treatment becomes essential. This study investigated prospective use of onion peel extract as a PS in combination with 405 nm blue light for the inactivation of Salmonella Typhimurium, a common foodborne pathogen on eggs. Extracts were obtained using 99% ethanol, 50% ethanol, and distilled water (DW). Their photosensitizing activities were then compared. The combination of 405 nm blue light and onion peel extract using 99% ethanol reduced bacterial populations more effectively than blue light treatment alone, while also increasing reactive oxygen species generation, cell membrane permeability, lipid peroxidation, and DNA damage levels. However, the antimicrobial effect of the 99% ethanol extract did not show a concentration dependence. Spraying DW extract on eggshell treated with 99% ethanol onion peel extract at 1 mg/mL and blue light further enhanced Salmonella reduction. Liquid chromatography was conducted for component separation. However, none of the separated fractions exhibited a significant antibacterial effect, suggesting that the active compounds responsible for antibacterial activity might work synergistically in the crude extract rather than individually. In contrast, the crude extract exhibited a significant antibacterial effect, suggesting that 99% ethanol-extracted onion peel can serve as a PS, particularly in its crude state without purification, and effectively inactivate Salmonella on eggshells. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: Antimicrobial blue light (aBL) in the range of 400-470 nm is a promising nonthermal technology with several advantages, including minimal impact on food quality and safety. This study optimized the concentration of onion peel extract to improve its effectiveness as a photosensitizer in aBL treatment against Salmonella Typhimurium on eggshells. These results may serve as a reference for further optimizing aBL treatments, offering a potentially sustainable and cost-effective photosensitizer for pathogen control.",,,

Nanotechnology plays a pivotal role in addressing these issues, particularly through the development of polymer nanocomposites (PNCs). PNCs are hybrid materials composed of a polymer matrix embedded with nanoscale fillers. These composites can be classified based on the type of matrix (ceramic, metal, or polymer) and their structural properties (exfoliated or intercalated forms). Synthesis methods, such as solvent casting and in situ polymerization, ensure the uniform dispersion of nanoparticles within the polymer matrix. PNC-based drug delivery systems are categorized into two types: passive targeting, which leverages the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect, and active targeting, which relies on ligand-receptor interactions. In the pharmaceutical industry, recent developments in nanocomposite-based systems have demonstrated great promise, especially in terms of improving medication solubility, stability, and bioavailability while reducing adverse effects. These methods use nanoparticles embedded in a matrix to increase drug delivery, addressing issues, such as poor solubility and limited bioavailability associated with conventional therapies.

Polymeric films were prepared by the solvent casting method. Selected physicochemical properties and the tendency to form biofilm on the polymer surface were investigated. As the amount of DLS soft segments in the polymer matrix increased, changes in the FTIR-ATR spectra (signal intensity), surface (SEM), and phase transition (DSC) were observed. The higher the content of the DLS segment, the lower the transition temperatures and the smoother the film's surface.

Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) is a cytoplasmic transcription factor that regulates cell proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, angiogenesis, inflammation, and immune responses. Its aberrant activation triggers tumor progression by promoting the expression of oncogenic genes; thus, STAT3 is classified as an oncoprotein. The aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) is a ligand-activated transcription factor that responds to a wide variety of chemicals, including carcinogens like dioxins, inducing genes associated with detoxification, proliferation, and immune regulation. Recent reports show that AhR plays a critical role in cancer development and maintenance. AhR may interact with signaling pathways, like the STAT3 pathway, which mediates the carcinogenic effects of several pollutants. Various chemical agents, such as industrial waste and hydrocarbon compounds, can alter the expression or signaling activity of AhR and STAT3 pathways, leading to different types of cancers.

Quinoa is known for its high nutritional value and strong drought tolerance, but its molecular mechanism in response to drought stress is still unclear. In this study, we used drought-tolerant (D2) and drought-sensitive (ZK1) quinoa varieties, and PEG-6000 was used to simulate drought stress in quinoa seedlings. Phenotypic and physiological biochemical indicators were measured during the seedling stage, and LC-MS was used for a metabolite analysis of drought stress to explore the drought tolerance mechanism of quinoa under drought stress. With the intensification of drought stress, chlorophyll content gradually increased, and D2 reached its maximum at W4, an increase of 49.85% compared with W1. The total chlorophyll content, photosynthesis rate, and stomatal conductance of ZK1 were significantly lower than D2 under moderate and severe drought stress. Metabolomic results showed that a total of 1295 positive ion mode (pos) metabolites and 914 negative ion mode (neg) metabolites were identified. Of these, 12(R)-HETE, phosphatidylcholine, monogalactose diester (MGDG), and stachyose up-regulated expression under drought stress. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis showed that unsaturated fatty acid biosynthesis and glycerophospholipid metabolism pathways were significantly enriched. In summary, our results elucidate that quinoa responds to drought stress by accumulating chlorophyll and sugars, activating unsaturated fatty acid metabolism, and protecting the photosynthetic system. These findings provide new insights for the breeding of drought-tolerant quinoa varieties and the study of drought tolerance mechanisms.",,,

This study investigates the involvement of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), and p38 pathways in CNV development, as well as the therapeutic potential of sprouty 2 (SPRY2), an MAPK inhibitor, in a laser-induced mouse model. The expressions of ERK, JNK, and p38 proteins were analyzed using Western blotting and immunostaining. Immunofluorescence imaging revealed increased p-ERK and p-JNK expression in the retina, retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), and choroid up to day 7. Co-immunostaining showed p-ERK colocalized with CD31, CD11b, F4/80, cytokeratin, and GFAP in the retina, while p-JNK and p-p38 were associated with angiogenesis and inflammation throughout the retina and choroid. Compared to aflibercept, SPRY2 administration significantly inhibited CNV lesions, endothelial proliferation, fibrosis, and apoptosis, while better-preserving RPE integrity. SPRY2-treated mice showed a stronger reduction in CNV-related inflammation, epithelial-mesenchymal transition, and photoreceptor apoptosis. These results highlight the MAPK pathway's role in CNV pathogenesis, with ERK primarily mediating Müller cell gliosis and JNK, contributing to angiogenesis and inflammation.

Autophagy may be associated with the dendritic cell (DC) response to chemical sensitizers. We hypothesized that CIN would activate DCs through autophagy during skin sensitization. In this study, Tohoku Hospital Pediatrics-1 cells (THP-1 cells) were used as an in vitro DC model, and we evaluated the expression of cell activation markers, intracellular oxidative stress, and autophagy pathway-related genes in response to CIN in THP-1 cells. CIN exposure activated THP-1 cells, which presented increases in CD54 and CD86 expression and ROS generation. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that the genes that were differentially expressed after CIN stimulation were mostly associated with autophagy. The autophagy markers LC3B, p62, and ATG5 had upregulated mRNA and protein levels after CIN exposure. Furthermore, the effects of the autophagy inhibitor Baf-A1 and the autophagy activator rapamycin were investigated on CIN-treated cells. Pretreatment with Baf-A1 in THP-1 cells impaired autophagic flux and dramatically promoted cell activation and oxidative stress triggered by CIN. Conversely, rapamycin inhibited cell activation and the ROS content in CIN-challenged cells while increasing autophagy levels via a reduction in mTOR expression. These results suggest that the autophagy pathway has a pivotal influence on the regulation of CIN-induced activation in THP-1 cells, which provides new insight into the pathogenesis and precise therapeutic strategies for ACD.",,,

The combination of these strategies must be wisely selected, and their interaction should be considered in quantitative microbial risk assessments (QMRA) assessing the listeriosis risk. The aim of the present study was to develop a QMRA model to assess the impact of intervention strategies, including formulation with lactate, bioprotective cultures and the use of high-pressure processing (HPP), on reducing the listeriosis risk associated to the consumption of cooked meat products by elderly populations. Particularly, the interaction between the formulation with lactate and the application of HPP was addressed as lactate is reported to exert (i) a piezo-protection on L. monocytogenes inactivation by HPP and (ii) a piezo-stimulation effect on the growth rate of survivors. Results showed that the reduction of product's shelf-life or the use of biopreservation strategies (lactate and bioprotective cultures) were more effective in reducing the listeriosis risk than mild HPP treatments. Moreover, the application of a mild HPP treatment in combination with the formulation with lactate did not result in a higher risk reduction compared to the formulation of lactate alone.

We conducted a scoping review to explore the determinants and impacts of AMR within the beef value chain in SSA, highlighting the challenges and progress in mitigating AMR risks in livestock production. This review identifies key factors contributing to AMR, including the overuse and misuse of antimicrobials, inadequate veterinary oversight, and weak regulatory frameworks. These practices are prevalent across various stages of the beef value chain, from farm to slaughterhouse, and are exacerbated by informal markets and insufficient infrastructure. Our findings also highlight the role of environmental factors, such as contamination of feed, water, and manure, in the spread of resistant pathogens. Additionally, gaps in AMR surveillance, education, and enforcement limit effective control measures in the region. While efforts to combat AMR have gained momentum in some countries, including the development of national action plans and surveillance systems, substantial challenges remain. These include poor adherence to antimicrobial guidelines, insufficient veterinary training, and the lack of integration between sectors. There is a need for targeted research to better understand antimicrobial misuse, socio-economic drivers, and the environmental pathways of AMR, as well as the need for stronger regulatory frameworks and cross-border cooperation.

However, the mechanisms underlying their embryotoxic effects remain inadequately understood. In the current study, we investigated the effects of ACR and GLY exposure on oocyte and embryo developmental competence, focusing on DNA damage, apoptosis, autophagy, and epigenetic regulation. Oocytes were exposed to varying concentrations of ACR and GLY during in vitro maturation. The results demonstrated that both ACR and GLY significantly reduced cleavage and blastocyst developmental rates in a dose-dependent manner. Consequently, treated oocytes exhibited actin organization disruption, increased DNA damage, and heightened apoptosis compared to the control. Autophagy-related markers, including LC3A, LC3B, and ATG7, were significantly elevated in the treatment groups. Moreover, both ACR and GLY compounds altered the expression of the epigenetic and MAPK signaling pathway regulators, such as DPPA3, EZH1, EZH2, EED, DUSP1, and ASK1. These disruptions collectively impaired embryonic development. This study underscores the adverse effects of ACR and GLY on reproductive health, driven by oxidative stress, genotoxicity, dysregulated autophagy, and epigenetic alterations.",,,

40137008,Preliminary Study on the Development of a Real-Time Pressure-Monitoring Facial Mask for Burn Rehabilitation.,,European burn journal,10.3390/ebj6010012,"The most common aftereffect of severe burns in patients is hypertrophic scarring. Hypertrophic scars typically form following severe burns; it refers to excessive collagen production in the dermal layer during the healing process, resulting in an abnormal raised scar. Currently, practical treatments for suppressing hypertrophic scars include laser therapy, pressure therapy, and the application of silicone sheets for moisture retention. The most extensively used treatment involves compression therapy using specially designed garments for the affected areas. However, this method has limitations when applied to curved surfaces like the face. To address this issue, three-dimensional (3D) scanning and 3D printing techniques have been actively developed for face masks and have shown promising clinical results. Unfortunately, current facial masks under development lack a sensor system to measure pressure, making it difficult to ensure consistent and appropriate pressures during clinical trials. In this study, we have developed a burn pressure mask capable of real-time pressure monitoring. The facial mask developed in this study utilizes an FSR-type sensor to measure the pressure applied to the skin. We have also embedded electrical wires within the mask to enhance its comfort and wearability. For this study, two patients wore the facial mask with real-time pressure measurement capabilities for 4 weeks in 12 h per day on average. We evaluated whether the mask maintained the appropriate pressure range (15-25 mmHg) throughout the clinical trial and whether it effectively inhibited scar formation. Through the analysis of recorded pressure signal data, we confirmed that the patients consistently maintained the appropriate pressure while wearing the mask during the clinical trial. Additionally, we observed significant differences in skin moisture levels, transepidermal water loss, and scar thickness before and after the experiment. These findings suggest that the facial mask, featuring real-time monitoring capabilities, effectively prevents the formation of hypertrophic scars.",Cho YM; Youn HS,T&L Co.,

Changes in the ECS can also be associated with pathological processes, such as increased acidity during the development of solid tumors, changes in the composition and nature of the organization of the extracellular matrix (ECM) during fibroblast activation, an increase in the content of soluble molecules during necrosis, and other processes. The interaction of these two systems, the EVs and the ESC, leads to structural and functional alteration in both participants. In the current review, we will focus on these alterations in the EVs which we termed post-secretory modification and processes (PSMPs) of EVs. PSPMs can have a significant effect on the immediate cellular environment and on the spread of the pathological process in the body as a whole.

The metabolism of tryptophan plays a critical role in maintaining immune homeostasis and tolerance, as well as in preventing excessive inflammatory responses. Tryptophan-2,3-dioxygenase (TDO2) is a tetrameric heme protein and serves as one of the pivotal rate-limiting enzymes in the first step of tryptophan metabolism. Dysregulation of TDO2 expression has been observed in various digestive system diseases, encompassing those related to the oral cavity, esophagus, liver, stomach, pancreas, and colon and rectum. Digestive system diseases are the most common clinical diseases, with complex clinical manifestations and interrelated symptoms, and have become a research hotspot in the field of medicine. Studies have demonstrated that aberrant TDO2 expression is closely associated with various clinical manifestations and disease outcomes in patients with digestive system disorders. Consequently, TDO2 has garnered increasing recognition as a promising therapeutic target for digestive system diseases in recent years, attracting growing attention. This article provides a brief overview of the role of TDO2 in the tryptophan pathway, emphasizing its significant involvement in diseases of the digestive system. Strategies targeting TDO2 through specific inhibitors suggest considerable promise in enhancing therapeutic outcomes for digestive diseases.

Protein arginine methyltransferase 1 (PRMT1) is the major enzyme responsible for asymmetric arginine dimethylation and plays a role in diverse biological processes, including cardiovascular function. Yet, its role in endothelial cells (ECs) remains poorly understood. Here, the role of PRMT1 is investigated in ECs, particularly in the context of COPD pathogenesis. Endothelial-specific PRMT1 knockout mice exhibit pulmonary hemorrhage, inflammation, barrier disruption, and apoptosis, accompanied by hyperactivation of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB). Bulk RNA sequencing of whole lungs and single-cell RNA sequencing of pulmonary ECs reveal that endothelial PRMT1 ablation results in a major alteration in inflammation-related gene expression. In a COPD model, PRMT1 deficiency aggravates the COPD phenotypes, including enlarged alveolar spaces, increased cell death, and senescence.

While pregnane-based compounds have been suggested as AChE inhibitors, their mechanism of action remains unclear. This study employed machine learning (ML) and molecular modeling to probe the molecular interaction of AChE with steroidal pregnanes. The ML models were trained and validated on AChE bioactivity datasets to predict pIC50 and pKi values of small-molecule compounds. Among the models tested, the Random Forest Regressor demonstrated superior performance and was used to identify pregnanes with pIC50 ≥ 5 and pKi ≥ 7 as promising inhibitors. Molecular docking revealed strong molecular interactions between AChE and several pregnanes, particularly 21-[(3-Hydroxy-2-naphthyl)oxy]pregnane-2-one. This compound interacted with critical sub-sites within the AChE binding gorge, including the catalytic active site, peripheral anionic site, oxyanion hole, and anionic sub-site, through multiple hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions. Molecular dynamics simulations over 100 ns indicated structural stability and conformational flexibility of representative AChE-pregnane complexes as indicated by the dynamic parameters and cluster patterns. The Molecular Mechanics with Generalized Born Surface Area free energy analysis confirmed strong binding affinities, while residual energy decomposition provided insights into key residue contributions. Additionally, the pregnanes demonstrated favorable blood-brain barrier permeability and other drug-like properties, suggesting their potential as neurotherapeutic agents.

The fatty acids of royal jelly exhibit immunoregulatory, anticancer, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant properties, which have garnered significant interest. The most prevalent among them is 10-hydroxydecanoic acid (10-HDA). Zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnONPs) demonstrate a renoprotective effect, likely due to their antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and antiapoptotic properties. This study evaluated the therapeutic efficacy of 10-HDA and ZnONPs, administered either as monotherapy or in combination, against lead-induced nephrotoxicity. Male rats were orally administered lead acetate (PbAc) for three months, followed by the administration of 10-HDA and/or ZnONPs for one month. Exposure to PbAc resulted in elevated renal lead concentration, as well as increased serum levels of urea, creatinine, and cystatin C. The condition resulted in damage to the renal parenchyma, characterised by degenerative glomeruli and tubules, and exhibited the highest lesion score. Nrf2 and HO-1 exhibited reduced expression and diminished antioxidant enzyme levels subsequent to PbAc poisoning. Additionally, there was an increase in the inflammatory and apoptotic signalling through the p-IKK/NF-κB axis. The administration of 10-HDA and ZnONPs significantly decreased renal lead levels and improved antioxidant capacity. Moreover, renal inflammatory markers (TNF-α, p-IKK, IL-1β, IL-6, and IL-8) and proapoptotic indicators (Bax and Caspase-3) were significantly suppressed. The combined therapy demonstrated a synergistic effect (combination index < 1). In conclusion, the results indicated that 10-HDA and ZnONPs have the potential to be a supplement or even an effective treatment to alleviate the adverse effects of lead poisoning. This is potentially attributed to their potent ameliorative actions against oxidation, inflammation, and apoptosis.",,,d.ghareeb@alexu.edu.eg.

Aggregation and accumulation of amyloid beta (Aβ) and tau are the most prominent features in the brains of AD patients. Aggregated Aβ and tau exert neurotoxic effects in the central nervous system, contributing to the pathogenesis and progression of AD. They also act synergistically to cause neurodegeneration, resulting in memory loss. In this context, dual inhibition of Aβ and tau aggregation, or dissociation of these two aggregates, is considered promising for AD treatment. Recently, dual inhibitors capable of simultaneously targeting the aggregation and dissociation of both Aβ and tau have been investigated. Specific amino acid domains of Aβ and tau associated with their aggregation/dissociation have been identified. Subsequently, therapeutic agents that prevent aggregation or promote disaggregation by targeting these domains have been identified/developed. In this review, we summarize the major domains and properties involved in Aβ and tau aggregation, as well as the therapeutic effects and mechanisms of agents that simultaneously regulate their aggregation and dissociation.

Selenium-enriched ionic fertilizer and cucumber were selected as the test materials. A one-way, randomized design was adopted to set up four selenium solutions with concentrations of 0 mg/L, 3 mg/L, 6 mg/L, and 12 mg/L to investigate the effects of biofortification with different amounts of selenium concentrations on the growth of cucumber and the occurrence of powdery mildew in greenhouses. A leaf inoculation test was conducted by setting up three groups of treatments: water and fungicide (seedling fungicide) as the control groups, and 6 mg/L selenium-enriched ionic fertilizer as the treatment group. These treatments were selected to investigate the effect of selenium on the control of powdery mildew in greenhouse-grown cucumbers as well as the effect of selenium on the germination of powdery mildew pathogen spores. The results demonstrated that both the 6 mg/L and 12 mg/L selenium-enriched ionic fertilizer solutions had growth-promoting and yield-increasing effects on cucumber and that the difference in the growth-promoting effects of these treatments was insignificant. The 3 mg/L, 6 mg/L, and 12 mg/L treatments improved the nutritional quality of cucumber fruits, reducing the total acidity of the fruits and increasing the content of soluble proteins in the fruits; the 6 mg/L and 12 mg/L treatments increased the content of selenium in the fruits, and the difference in selenium enrichment between the two treatments was not significant. The 6 mg/L selenium solution had the greatest effectiveness in alleviating leaf photosynthesis inhibition by the powdery mildew fungus, in mitigating powdery mildew damage and in reducing the plant disease index. The results of the leaf inoculation trials revealed that at a concentration of 6 mg/L, the effects of the selenium-enriched ionic fertilizer were comparable to those of pharmaceutical treatments for powdery mildew disease.

Unlike cold-blooded vertebrates, mammals lack Müller glia (MG)-mediated retinal regeneration, indicating the limited regenerative capacity of mammalian MG. Here, we identify prospero-related homeobox 1 (Prox1) as a key factor restricting this process. Prox1 accumulates in MG of degenerating human and mouse retinas but not in regenerating zebrafish. In mice, Prox1 in MG originates from neighboring retinal neurons via intercellular transfer. Blocking this transfer enables MG reprogramming into retinal progenitor cells in injured mouse retinas. Moreover, adeno-associated viral delivery of an anti-Prox1 antibody, which sequesters extracellular Prox1, promotes retinal neuron regeneration and delays vision loss in a retinitis pigmentosa model. These findings establish Prox1 as a barrier to MG-mediated regeneration and highlight anti-Prox1 therapy as a promising strategy for restoring retinal regeneration in mammals.",Shim JH; Park JA,Celliaz Ltd.,jinwookim@kaist.ac.kr.

The abnormal redox balance in gastric cancer cells may represent a breakthrough in the treatment of gastric cancer. In this study, we report for the first time the development of reactive oxygen species (ROS)-sensitive hetero-polymeric prodrug nanoparticles (NPs) designed for the co-delivery of the Chinese herbal extract oridonin (ORI) and dihydroartemisinin (DHA) in combination therapy for gastric cancer. This strategy aims to disrupt the intracellular redox balance and ultimately induce ferroptosis in gastric cancer cells. The ROS-responsive ORI and DHA polymeric prodrug were synthesised by conjugating ORI or DHA to poly(ethylene glycol)-block-poly(L-lysine) (PEG-b-PLL) via a ROS-sensitive linker thioketal (TK). The resulting polymeric prodrugs self-assemble in water to form NPs OD-M. After internalization by gastric cancer cells, OD-M released ORI and DHA in response to high ROS conditions within cancer cells. The released ORI reacts with GSH to induce GSH depletion while DHA amplifies intracellular ROS levels, ultimately inducing ferroptosis in gastric cancer cells. Experimental results demonstrate that OD-M acts as both a GSH scavenger and ROS generator, effectively disrupting intracellular redox balance, inducing ferroptosis, and exhibiting effective anticancer efficacy in vitro and in vivo, offering a departure from traditional methods.",,,yfy0103@njucm.edu.cn.

However, the role of black raspberry polyphenols (HSM) in shaping metabolic dysregulation and perturbation in gut microbiota (GM) to promote lipid metabolism and liver regeneration is unclear. In this work, the effects of HSM in mitigating metabolic disturbances and hepatic damage induced by a high-fat diet (HFD) and antibiotics (Abs) in mice were measured. HSM significantly alleviated HFD-induced obesity, insulin resistance, lipid and glucose metabolic dysregulation, as well as hepatic damage by activating the PI3K/AKT pathway and pregnane X receptor (PXR)-farnesoid X receptor (FXR) axis with improved GM, which was evidenced by short-chain fatty acids, 16S, and nontarget metabolism analysis. Excellent results were also evident in mice treated with Abs.

Therefore, this study explored the association between osteoporosis under treatment and all-cause and specific-cause mortalities using nationwide retrospective cohort data from South Korea. This study utilized data from the National Health Insurance Service screening cohort of South Korea from 2002 to 2019. Participants with osteoporosis who had undergone treatment at least twice and were diagnosed based on bone densitometry were included. Control groups were matched 1:1 based on age, sex, income, and region. Propensity score overlap weighting was applied to balance covariates. Cox proportional hazards models and Fine-Gray sub-distribution hazard models were used to assess all-cause and specific-cause mortalities across 14 disease categories based on the Korean standard classification of diseases. Finally, 34,181 participants were included in both osteoporosis and control groups. The largest age group was 55-59 years, with a majority of female participants (81.60%).

Additionally, bioactive peptides possess biological features that have the potential to be beneficial in preventing many metabolic illnesses; hence, the ingestion of these peptides holds the potential to be advantageous for human health. In light of this, the current work aimed to study the impacts of in ovo feeding during the late stages of embryonic development with cluster bean peptide (CBP) on the hatchability, productive performance, lipid profile, liver and kidney functions, immunological response, and antioxidant status of broilers. Six hundred and forty-eight (648) fertilized Ross 308 broiler breeder eggs were used in this study. To remove infertile eggs and dead embryos, the eggs were manually candled on 7 and 17 day of incubation (DOI). On the 18.5th DOI, the eggs were separated into four treatment groups (156 eggs/each), and the first group did not receive any treatment and represented the negative control (NC). Meanwhile, the other treatment groups were injected into the amnion membrane. The second group was only subjected to needle penetration and represented the positive control (PC). The third group was denoted by the letter T1 and received an injection of 1 mg CBP/egg. The fourth group was denoted by the letter T2 and received an injection of 2 mg CBP/egg. In ovo feeding by CBP exhibited significant improvements in the body weight of newly hatched chicks, particularly at the 2 mg CBP level. The administration with CBP did not significantly affect the carcass characteristics of 28-day-old broilers. In ovo-administrated groups with CBP, higher plasma concentrations of total protein and its fractions were observed at hatch and on day 28 of age. In ovo treatment with CBP, blood lipid profile parameters significantly improved at hatch and 28 days of age. Liver and kidney function parameters were improved in response to the in ovo administration with CBP in newly hatched chicks and on day 28 of age. Blood levels of glutathione (GSH) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) were considerably higher in the in ovo-administered groups with CBP; while levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) were significantly reduced due to CBP administration. The activity of digestive enzymes in blood plasma was decreased in newly hatched chicks but increased in 28-day-old broilers in response to in ovo administration with CBP. There was an improvement in the immunological response of hatched chicks from groups injected with CBP, particularly the T2 group (2 mg CBP), as evidenced by increased IgM and IgG levels.

Salicylic acid (SA) is a phytohormone that stimulates the plants immune response against various diseases. However, its function as a signaling molecule, particularly in relation to systemic acquired resistance (SAR) and induced systemic resistance (ISR), is still unclear. In this study, Bacillus megaterium JPR68 (BmJPR68) enhances the ISR of Capsicum chinense Jacq., resulting in elevated levels of SA within the plants. SA effectively inhibited the mycelial growth of Rhizoctonia solani and significantly reduced the necrosis, chlorosis, and collar rot in plants. The in vitro investigation revealed that the mycelial growth declined with increasing concentrations of SA and was completely inhibited at a concentration of 15 mM. The pathogenicity assay showed that leaves and fruits treated with SA impeded hyphal development and significantly retarded the growth of R. solani. In split root techniques, more SA was accumulated in the root tissues at the bacterized site compared to the non-bacterized side, although this accumulation reduced after 45 days. Additionally, the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) was significantly diminished in plants treated with BmJPR68. SA production was assessed in both BmJPR68 and induced plants, indicating that the bacterial strain produced more SA compared to the induced plants. Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR) analysis confirmed the presence of functional groups like O-H, N-H, S = O, C = C, C-N, and carboxylic/amine.

In the capital city of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, an ethnobotanical survey revealed the use of Dysphania ambrosioides (L.) Mosyakin & Clemants, Ocimum gratissimum L. and Tetradenia riparia (Hochst.) Codd, often in combination, for treating oral microbial diseases. While these plants have been widely studied individually; their combined potential has not been investigated. The present research aims to explore the phytochemical composition, the synergistic antimicrobial, and antioxidant potential of different extracts from these three mentioned plants. Phytochemical composition of the decocted and percolated extracts from the three plants was determined using qualitative analysis and the ultra-performance liquid chromatography quadrupole time of flight tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-QTOF-MS). Antimicrobial activity was assessed using the broth dilution method, while antioxidant activity was evaluated using the DPPH method. For the antimicrobial studies, the decocted and percolated extracts were tested against Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Qualitative phytochemical analysis revealed the presence of alkaloids, saponins, flavonoids, iridoids, and anthraquinones in all the plant extracts. The methanolic extract of T. riparia exhibited the highest phenolic content (299.146 ± 0.143 mg GAE/g extract), while O. gratissimum had the highest flavonoid content (138.256 ± 0.277 mg QE/g extract). UPLC analysis identified several metabolites in the plant extracts including rosmarinic acid, cirsimaritin, xanthomicrol and kaempferol derivatives. Rosmarinic acid was consistently identified across all the plant extract combinations, while other flavonoids such as apigenin 7-glycosides, kaempferitin and luteolin 7-O-glucoside, were detected in specific plant extract combinations.

Our study uses ecological momentary assessment (EMA) and deep learning to predict momentary NPOU, medication nonadherence, and treatment retention in MOUD patients. Study participants included adults receiving MOUD at a large outpatient treatment program. We predicted NPOU (EMA-based), medication nonadherence (Electronic Health Record [EHR]- and EMA-based), and treatment retention (EHR-based) using context-sensitive EMAs (e.g., stress, pain, social setting). We used recurrent deep learning models with 7-day sliding windows to predict the next-day outcomes, using Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC) for assessment. We employed SHapley additive ExPlanations (SHAP) to understand feature latency and importance. Participants comprised 62 adults with 14,322 observations. Model performance varied across EMA subtypes and outcomes with AUCs spanning 0.58-0.97. Recent substance use was the best performing predictor for EMA-based NPOU (AUC = 0.97). Life-contextual factors were best performers for EMA-based medication nonadherence (AUC = 0.68) and retention (AUC = 0.89), and substance use risk factors (e.g., nicotine and alcohol use) and self-reported MOUD adherence performed best for predicting EHR-based medication nonadherence (AUC = 0.79). SHAP revealed varying latencies between predictors and outcomes. Findings support the effectiveness of EMA and deep learning for forecasting actionable outcomes in persons receiving MOUD.

Current vaccination strategies provide only partial protection, highlighting the need for more effective prevention and treatment methods. This study aimed to develop a novel compound throat anti-viral (CTA) from natural plants using data from the Traditional Chinese Medicine Inheritance System and identification through liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. CTA demonstrated substantial anti-IBV effects both in vitro and in vivo studies. In vitro, CTA significantly inhibited IBV multiplication and alleviated the pathological lesions in chicken embryonic kidney cells, tracheal rings, and chicken embryos. In vivo, a seven-day treatment with CTA obtained much milder clinical signs, enhanced growth performance, and better immune organ indices in infected chickens. Additionally, CTA treatment reduced IBV levels in the trachea and lungs and increased specific antibody titers. CTA also maintained body homeostasis, exhibiting strong antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties that mitigated respiratory tract damage. Metabolomics and network pharmacology analyses, revealed that CTA's antiviral effects are mediated through the FoxO signaling pathway. This study successfully developed an effective prescription database based on the Traditional Chinese Medicine Inheritance System and validated the antiviral efficacy of CTA through comprehensive in vitro and in vivo experiments.

Inhalation, ingestion, and skin contact are the main ways of exposure to Cd. Bone is one of the target organs of Cd. The aging of the population has been considered as the reason for the high incidence rate of osteoporosis, but recent studies have emphasized that the risk of osteoporosis is related to Cd exposure. With the widespread use of Cd-containing materials in industrial and agricultural activities, the risk of Cd exposure is worrying. This review covers the epidemiological, in vivo, and in vitro studies on Cd exposure and osteoporosis. Epidemiological evidence has emphasized a positive association between Cd exposure and the occurrence rates of osteoporosis and fractures. Experimental studies have demonstrated that Cd induces osteoporosis through both direct and indirect pathways. The indirect pathway encompasses inducing renal dysfunction to impair calcium and phosphorus metabolism, whereas the direct pathway consists of directly influencing bone cells. This review aims to emphasize that Cd exposure may be an overlooked risk factor for osteoporosis and to elucidate the direct and indirect molecular mechanisms by which Cd induces osteoporosis.

In addition, we used the Patient Focused Medicines Development (PFMD)'s Patient Engagement Quality Guidance (PEQG) as a framework to assess the quality of PPIE. We planned to conduct narrative synthesis of included studies, however there were insufficient studies and data reported. We included three RWD studies that reported PPIE from the peer-reviewed literature and two NICE HSTs. One of the HSTs included data from one of the peer-reviewed journal articles. Reporting of PPIE in included studies was limited. No studies reported a PPIE framework and it was unclear how integrated and meaningful PPIE was. Four out of seven of PFMD's quality criteria for PPIE were poorly reported by included studies. This suggests reporting and/or conduct of PPIE requires improvement in RWD studies. Our review found that PPIE was rarely reported in RWDE research and uncovers a need for consistent reporting. For most publications there was insufficient information to judge the extent to which patients and carers, were considered meaningful partners. However, our review provided preliminary evidence that PPIE can influence protocol development, recruitment, and retention methods in RWD studies. More inclusive approaches to PPIE would help interpretation of RWE regarding relevance and importance to patients and carers. Patient and public involvement and engagement (PPIE) in research is increasingly important, ensuring that patients are partners in all stages of research and that research focuses on issues relevant to patients. PPIE happens a lot in clinical trials research but is much newer in real world data studies (RWD). As RWD is important to understand real world issues, understanding the type and meaningfulness of PPIE in these studies is important. Working with patients, we started by looking at what had already been published. We looked in medical journal databases for scientific publications of RWD studies and Real world evidence (RWE) included in National Institute for Health Care Excellence (NICE) technology appraisals. We selected studies where PPIE was reported and looked at the process for PPIE and how meaningful it was. From looking at these sources we found that there were only 3 studies and 2 NICE technology appraisals that clearly reported PPIE. It was difficult to understand how meaningful PPIE was, as this information was not included in most studies. Our research uncovers a need for an increase in PPIE in RWDE research or more clear reporting. This is important, because where PPIE was mentioned, it showed that it can influence study protocol development, recruitment and retention in the study.",Dews SA; Bohm N; Butfield R; Campbell-Burton A,Pfizer Ltd.,

However, LP diets may disrupt amino acid (AA) balance, affecting growth and health. Supplementing with nonprotein nitrogen sources such as diammonium phosphate (DP) can enhance nitrogen utilization and support protein synthesis efficiently. This study aimed to investigate the effects of adding DP to LP diets on growth performance, organ indices, carcass traits, meat quality, and AA composition in growing pigs. Seventy-five barrows (Duroc × Landrace × Yorkshire) were randomly assigned to 5 dietary treatments: Pos Ctrl (CP: 13.50%), DP1 (CP: 12.00% + DP), DP2 (CP: 10.50% + DP), DP3 (CP: 9.00% + DP), and Neg Ctrl (CP: 9.00%). Each DP-supplemented diet aimed to maintain an essential AA nitrogen to total nitrogen (EAA-N/TN) ratio of 0.48. The pigs had free access to food and water for the 41-day experimental period, with body weight and feed intake were recorded monthly. After overnight fasting, pigs were euthanized, and carcass traits, meat quality, and organ indices were assessed. Blood, liver, and muscle samples were collected for analyses of plasma biochemistry and AA profiles. The study found that feeding the DP2 diet resulted in the best growth performance, while the DP3 diet significantly improved ADG and G:F compared with the Neg Ctrl diet. The DP3 diet also significantly increases relative liver weight compared with the Neg Ctrl diet. Although no significant differences were observed in carcass traits or meat quality among the dietary treatments, the DP3 diet had a tendency to reduced plasma total protein levels relative to the Neg Ctrl diet. Feeding the DP3 diet did not alter the free AA profile in plasma and liver of growing pigs compared with the Neg Ctrl diet, and there was no effect between the different diets on the hydrolyzed AA profile in muscle. Furthermore, the DP3 diet significantly increased Tau concentrations in the longissimus dorsi muscle (LM) while significantly reducing Car levels compared with the Neg Ctrl diet. In conclusion, these results suggest that adding DP to the LP diet can enhance growth performance and improve meat flavor-related AA content without compromising carcass traits or meat quality. Low-protein (LP) diets are widely acknowledged for reducing feed costs and nitrogen excretion. However, they may disrupt amino acid (AA) balance, potentially impairing growth. This study aimed to investigated the effects of adding diammonium phosphate (DP) to LP diets on the growth performance, carcass traits, meat quality, and AA composition in pigs. Seventy-five pigs were randomly assigned to five dietary treatments: a positive control (Pos Ctrl, 13.5% CP), three LP diets supplemented with DP (DP1: 12.0% CP + DP, DP2: 10.5% CP + DP, DP3: 9.0% CP + DP), and a negative control (Neg Ctrl, 9.0% CP). DP supplementation aimed to maintain a specific essential AA to total nitrogen ratio. Pigs had free access to water both food for 41 days, and body weight and feed intake were recorded. Results showed that growth performance was best in the DP2 group, while the DP3 diet increased ADG, G:F, and liver weight. No significant differences were observed in carcass traits or meat quality, but DP3 reduced plasma total protein levels and altered AA composition in the longissimus dorsi muscle. Overall, the addition of DP to the LP diet improved growth performance and meat flavor-related AA content without compromising meat quality.",,,

Hydroxychloroquine sulfate (HCQS), an antimalarial drug, was potentially used for clinical trials with the hope of treating patients suffering from SARS-CoV-2 during the COVID-19 pandemic. Herein, we have extensively delineated the binding interactions of HCQS with RNA under physiological conditions using multi-spectroscopic and calorimetric approaches. Our results demonstrated that HCQS binds to RNA through the groove-binding mode in uridine- and cytidine-rich regions. The mode of binding was meticulously characterized by fluorescence quenching studies and circular dichroism spectroscopy, well complemented by other experiments. Our results obtained from isothermal titration calorimetry reveal the phenomenon of the release of bound water molecules when HCQS binds at the groove position of RNA, the process being entropically driven. Furthermore, we have employed the concept of host-guest chemistry for the sequestration of RNA-bound HCQS using a water-soluble, non-toxic, 4-sulfocalix[4]arene as a basket-type macrocyclic host. This investigation may be conducive to the development of safe RNA-based therapeutics like RNA-based vaccines that comprise small molecule-RNA interactions.",,,saptarshi@iiserb.ac.in.

Through forward genetic screening, we identified a red soil-sensitive-1 (rss1) mutant that exhibited severely retarded growth when grown in red soil but showed no evident phenotype in cinnamon soil. Under the red soil/high-Fe conditions, rss1 exhibited increased Fe but decreased copper (Cu) concentrations in both roots and shoots, and the rss1 phenotype was partially rescued by Cu supplement. RSS1 encodes an OsSPL9 transcription factor that is expressed in pericycle cells and parenchyma cells surrounding xylem in roots. Under high-Fe conditions, OsSPL9 activated expression of Cu transporters, including OsYSL16, OsCOPT1, and OsCOPT5 by binding to their promoters, and OsYSL16 overexpression partially rescued rss1 defects. We thus propose that OsSPL9 overcomes high-Fe imposed Cu deficiency by activating the expressions of Cu transporter genes, allowing rice to adapt to red soil.",,,

The objective of the current analysis was to characterize the pharmacokinetics (PK) of TV-46000 based on pooled data from phase 1 and phase 3 studies, and to further support clinical use aspects of TV-46000. A population PK (popPK) model was developed using TV-46000 PK data obtained from three phase 1 studies (n = 267) and two phase 3 trials (n = 425). A sequential parent-metabolite model structure was used, and the total active moiety (TAM) concentration-time profiles were simulated for TV-46000 once monthly (q1m) and once every 2 months (q2m) across the range of available doses and different administration sites. The popPK model adequately characterized the PK of risperidone and its active metabolite. TV-46000 reaches therapeutic plasma TAM concentrations (≥ 10 ng/mL) within 24 h following first dose administration. Three months after initiation of TV-46000, 86% and 88% of steady-state TAM exposure were achieved for q1m and q2m, respectively, and steady state was fully attained by 6 months (i.e., > 90% of steady-state TAM exposure). In addition, simulated D2 receptor occupancy for TV-46000 was generally within the therapeutic window of 60-80% during both dosing intervals. The developed popPK model, together with corresponding simulations, supports TV-46000 as a LASCA that offers flexible dosing intervals (q1m or q2m) and administration sites (abdomen or upper arm) and does not require oral supplementation or loading dose(s). TV-46000 is a long-acting injectable that is prescribed to patients with schizophrenia. The aim of this analysis was to characterize the amount of the drug in the blood over time (pharmacokinetics) and associated variability after subcutaneous injection, using modeling and simulations. The model showed that TV-46000 had similar exposure to that of other orally administered risperidone medications taken for schizophrenia. The exposure was similar whether patients were administered the injection of TV-46000 once monthly or once every 2 months. There were no differences in exposure whether the drug injection was administered in the arm or abdomen. Administering TV-46000 1 week earlier or later than the dosing instructions did not significantly affect the concentration of the drug in the blood over time. The simulations also suggested that TV-46000 bound to the receptors in the brain at levels needed to treat schizophrenia when it was given either once monthly or once every 2 months.",Perlstein I; Merenlender Wagner A; Elgart A; Zandvliet AS; Hellmann F; Lin Y; van Maanen E; Plock N; Fauchet F; Singh R,Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd.; Certara; Teva Branded Pharmaceuticals LLC; Magic Wand Research LLC,Rajendra.singh@tevapharm.com.
40122824,Integrated metabolomics and transcriptomics analysis reveals the potential mechanism by which Methyl jasmonate enhances the pungent flavor of soilless-cultivated Chinese chives (Allium tuberosum).,2025-05-14,BMC plant biology,10.1186/s12870-025-06410-3,"Methyl jasmonate (MeJA) is an effective plant elicitor that enhances secondary metabolism. Chinese chives are prized for their pungent flavor, yet the biosynthetic pathways and regulatory mechanisms of flavor compounds induced by MeJA remain unclear. This study integrated metabolomic and transcriptomic analyses to elucidate how MeJA modulates the biosynthesis of flavor substance precursors in soilless-cultivated Chinese chives. MeJA treatment improved the dry matter content and nutritional quality of Chinese chives. We identified 36 volatile and 183 nonvolatile differentially abundant metabolites between the MeJA-treated and control groups. Gene expression analysis revealed 193 candidate genes associated with flavor formation. Among all the genes, a total of 2,667 DEGs were enriched primarily in metabolic pathways, including secondary metabolite biosynthesis, linoleic acid metabolism, and phenylpropanoid biosynthesis. Furthermore, exogenous MeJA inhibited the synthesis of endogenous jasmonic acid as well as enzyme activity and gene expression related to metabolic pathways. It also promoted the conversion of S-alkyl-L-cysteine to S-alk(en)ylcysteine sulfoxides (CSOs), increasing the accumulation of the flavor precursor CSOs and increasing the levels of S-methyl-L-cysteine. This led to increased concentrations of the key garlic flavor compounds methiin and alliin, intensifying the pungent flavor of Chinese chives. Notably, MeJA-induced AtuFMO1 was associated with enhanced pungent flavor and may be regulated by AtuPHL7 and AP2/ERF-ERF transcription factors. In conclusion, exogenous MeJA activates key enzyme-encoding genes involved in the biosynthesis of garlic flavor precursor CSOs, leading to increased accumulation of the spicy compounds Methiin and Alliin. These findings establish AtuFMO1 as a central hub linking hormonal signaling to flavor biosynthesis and provide molecular targets for improving Allium crop flavor and quality through precision horticulture.",,,chaiq@gsau.edu.cn.

This study investigated the underlying mechanisms of gefitinib-induced liver injury and the protective effects of glycyrrhizic acid (GL) in mice and AML12 cells. Sixty mice were randomly divided into six groups: control, gefitinib, glutathione (200 mg/kg), and three doses of GL (50, 100, and 200 mg/kg). Liver injury was induced in mice through daily oral administration of gefitinib (400 mg/kg) for 16 days, with hepatotoxicity was assessed through serum alanine transaminase (ALT) and aspartate transaminase (AST) levels, and hepatic histopathology. Hepatic mRNA profiles were analyzed using RNA sequencing, with differentially expressed genes (DEGs) confirmed by reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) and Western blot. Finally, the effect of GL on the anticancer efficacy of gefitinib was assessed in A549 and Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC) lung cancer cells, as well as in a urethane-induced lung cancer mouse model. GL treatment significantly reduced liver index and serum ALT and AST levels, while also improving hepatic histopathology. Transcriptomic analysis identified 114 DEGs linked to the p53 pathway and cell cycle regulation. Further study indicated that GL inhibited the expression of p53 and p21, thereby upregulated Cyclin D1 expression, thereby alleviating gefitinib-induced cell cycle arrest without impairing its anticancer activity in vivo and in vitro. These findings highlight the potential of GL as a safe adjunct therapy, effectively mitigating gefitinib-induced hepatotoxicity while preserving its anticancer efficacy.",,,Limin512_zz@126.com.

Don (commonly known as Ban Zhi Lian) is renowned for its heat-clearing and detoxifying properties and has been used to treat inflammatory conditions and various cancers. While lung inflammation is an indication for S. barbata, its effects on acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) remain unclear. Dysregulated neutrophilic inflammation plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of ARDS. In this study, we aimed to investigate the novel application of S. barbata in treating neutrophilic inflammation and ARDS. We evaluated the therapeutic potential of the ethanol extract of S. barbata (SB-EtOH) in mitigating neutrophil-driven inflammatory responses. The chromatographic fingerprint of SB-EtOH was analyzed, and its ethnopharmacological mechanisms were examined for their effects on inflammatory responses in human neutrophils. The therapeutic potential of SB-EtOH was further assessed using a mouse model of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced ARDS. SB-EtOH significantly inhibited respiratory burst, degranulation, and chemotactic responses in activated human neutrophils without cytotoxic effects. Additionally, SB-EtOH attenuated phosphorylation of key inflammatory signaling molecules, Akt and p38, while reducing calcium mobilization in activated human neutrophils. In the LPS-induced ARDS mouse model, SB-EtOH reduced pulmonary neutrophil infiltration, lung tissue damage, and oxidative stress accumulation.

The CuO NPs were initially synthesized using neem leaf extract and characterized through UV- Visible spectroscopy, SEM, EDX, HR-TEM, FT-IR, XRD, XPS, DLS and zeta potential. Characterization confirmed their monoclinic crystalline structure, spherical morphology, high purity, and stability, with a mean size of 50.93 nm and a zeta potential of -32.50 mV. The antifungal activities of synthesized CuO NPs against the fungus Colletotrichum gloeosporioides were assessed using poisoned food technique in which 1000 ppm CuO NPs showed lowest colony diameter (20.70 mm) and highest per cent growth inhibition (77.00 %). Subsequently in a dipping treatment lowest per cent disease incidence (00.00 %) were recorded in fruit treated with CuO NPs @ 200 ppm and 250 ppm, respectively. While, highest shelf life (18.23 days) were recorded in fruit treated with CuO NPs @ 250 ppm. Untreated control fruit exhibited increased per cent weight loss, total sugar, reducing sugar, non-reducing sugar and total soluble solids (TSS) over the storage period which responsible for early and rapid ripening. Post-harvest treatments of CuO NPs improved mango quality by reducing weight loss, retaining firmness, and delaying ripening through maintaining peel thickness, lower sugar levels, and higher titratable acidity and ascorbic acid. The 250 ppm concentration was most effective, ensuring safety with copper levels below toxicity thresholds.

The addition of l-Thr at a concentration of 0.28 % recorded the heaviest body weight of ducklings after hatching, while the control or 0.07 % Thr group recorded the lowest values. These findings suggest that l-Thr supplementation at 0.28 % (constituting total Thr content of 0.66 %) is an effective nutritional strategy to optimize the performance of duck breeders and the quality of their offspring, providing valuable insights for dietary formulations in poultry production and emphasizing the importance of balanced amino acid nutrition for maximizing breeder performance and offspring quality.",,,zhengchuntian@gdaas.cn.

Several endolysins with amphipathic helices at the C-terminus have been reported to have intrinsic antibacterial activity against Gram-negative bacteria but their action mechanism is not fully elucidated. The sequence alignment analysis was assessed with the CLC Main workbench 7, and His-tagged endolysins were purified with affinity chromatography. Site-directed mutagenesis was used to generate mutations in the endolysin to make various endolysin mutants. The muralytic activity of the endolysin against Gram-negative bacteria was analyzed using a turbidity reduction assay and the antibacterial activities of the endolysins were assessed through a viable cell counting assay. We identified two endolysins, LysTS3 and LysTS6, both of which have similar sequences and structures including the amphipathic helices at their C-terminus. LysTS6 exhibited significantly higher antibacterial activity against Gram-negative bacteria compared to LysTS3 even though both enzymes have similar muralytic activity against the outer membrane-permeabilized Gram-negative bacteria. Systematic truncation and bioinformatic analysis of these two endolysins revealed a major difference in the charge on the surface of their C-terminal helices, suggesting the possibility that the charge on this helix can determine the antibacterial activity of the endolysins against Gram-negative bacteria. We could enhance the activity of LysTS3 against Gram-negative bacteria by replacing Ala The antibacterial activity of endolysin against Gram-negative bacteria could be enhanced by adjusting the surface charge on the C-terminal amphipathic helix to more positive, suggesting that the positive surface charge on the C-terminal amphipathic helix of endolysin is crucial for its penetration of outer membrane to reach peptidoglycan layer of Gram-negative bacteria.",,,sangryu@snu.ac.kr.

Indiscriminate use of antibiotics in human health and livestock management contributes to development and rapid spread of AMR. Staphylococcus aureus is a major opportunistic zoonotic pathogen that colonises the skin and nostrils of human beings and animals and continues to develop antimicrobial resistance against different agents. The study aimed to determine multiple antibiotic resistance indices of S. aureus isolates from healthy domestic goats and slaughterhouse attendants in Kampala, Uganda.Demographic characteristics of consenting slaughterhouse attendants and goat keepers were recorded through a questionnaire. Antibiotics use among slaughterhouse workers and domestic goats and skin infections in the past twelve months were recorded. Nasal swabs were collected from healthy domestic goats at household level (n = 378) and slaughterhouse attendants (n = 131). Isolates were obtained on mannitol salt agar (MSA) upon incubation at 35°C for 24 h. The Kirby-Bauer disc diffusion method was used to determine antimicrobial susceptibility to penicillin, gentamycin, erythromycin, tetracycline, ciprofloxacin, clindamycin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, linezolid, amoxicillin, ceftriaxone and cefoxitin. In this study, the participating slaughterhouse workers were predominantly male (79%) while does (90%) were the majority of the goats sampled. S. aureus carriage was 32% and 43% among slaughterhouse workers and goats, respectively. Methicillin resistant S. aureus carriage was 12% and 11% among slaughterhouse attendants and goats, respectively. There was a high level of exposure to antibiotics among S. aureus carriers (62%) and goats (41%) in the past one year, including use of critically important antimicrobials in human medicine for livestock disease management. Amoxicillin (17%) and ciprofloxacin (12%) were the most used antibiotics among the S. aureus carriers. Oxytetracycline (33%) and Penicillin-streptomycin combination (21%) were the most used antimicrobials in goat keeping. Close to a quarter of the human participants reported having suffered probable staphylococcal related infections like pustules in the previous months. With the exception of gentamycin and linezolid, all the S. aureus isolates from human nasal swabs were resistant to at least one of the antibiotics used. S. aureus isolates from goats' nasal swabs were resistant to at least one of the antibiotics studied. The multiple antibiotic resistance (MAR) index of 41% of S. aureus isolates from slaughterhouse attendants was greater than 0.2 (mean = 0.2 ± 0.2, range 0.1 to 0.7). The MAR index of 22% of S. aureus isolates from goats was greater than 0.2 (mean = 0.2 ± 0.1, range = 0 to 0.7). The most frequent multidrug resistance (MDR) pattern was FOX, CIP, E, TE, SXT, CRO, and CD among S. aureus isolates from slaughterhouse attendants. The most frequent MDR patterns for the isolates from goats were E, TE, CRO, CD and TE, CRO, CD.

The treatment of GPP includes non-biologic and biologic therapies. In Japan, biologic agents are being increasingly used as first-line treatment, with more biologics approved in Japan than in other countries. A previous secondary data-based study utilizing data in the Medical Data Vision database and the Japan Medical Data Center in Japan demonstrated heterogeneity in real-world biologic treatment patterns, with at least one switch during the follow-up period (mean n switches 3.8; mean length of follow-up 3.3 years) for approximately one third of patients with GPP treated with a biologic drug. The aim of this study was to evaluate where consensus lies among experts regarding switching biologic treatments for patients with GPP in Japan. A Delphi exercise that consists of three survey rounds was performed with ten Japanese dermatologists. Participants were asked to respond to questions related to experts' experience with specific biologics, experience with switching, timing of switches and importance of specific criteria (drivers) when making the decision to switch. The consensus threshold was 70%. Based on the results of the Delphi exercise, most experts rarely (60%) or never (20%) switch a biologic agent and only 20% switch often during acute symptoms/GPP flare driven by the short time of the flare; this result may be different during the maintenance phase. Lack of efficacy, loss of efficacy due to long-term use, side effects, contraindications, new products with better efficacy and safety evidence, risk of infection, and lack of adherence play an important role in making the decision to switch. Switches may occur for patients on biologics when flares occur (loss of effectiveness) or when there is insufficient response (lack of effectiveness). The decision to switch a biologic is impacted by several other criteria, including safety and the availability of more efficacious and better tolerated therapies. Overall, there is still an unmet need for robust evidence to inform GPP treatment choice.",Abe M,Sapporo Dermatology Clinic,ytada-tky@umin.ac.jp.

The remarkable clinical activity of programmed cell death protein 1/programmed death ligand 1 blockade, chimeric antigen receptor-T cells, and T cell engagers yielded new insights into how the mechanistic underpinnings of IO are reflected in the clinic. These insights and the sheer number of novel immunotherapies currently in the pipeline have made it clear that our strategies and tools for IO drug development must adapt. Recent innovations like engineered T cells and tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes demonstrate that immune-based treatments may rely on real-time manufacturing programs rather than off-the-shelf drugs. We now recognize adoptively transferred cells as living drugs. Progression criteria have been redefined due to the unique response patterns of IO. Harnessing the power of both biomarkers and the neoadjuvant setting earlier in drug development is of broad interest. The US Food and Drug Association is increasingly impacting the design of trials with respect to dose optimization and clinical endpoints. The use of novel endpoints such as pathologic complete/major response, treatment-free survival, and minimal residual disease is becoming more common. There is growing acceptance of using patient-reported outcomes as trial endpoints to better measure the true clinical benefit and impact of novel IO agents on quality of life. New opportunities created by modern data science and artificial intelligence to inform and accelerate drug development continue to emerge. The importance of streamlining the clinical research ecosystem and enhancing clinical trial access to facilitate the enrollment of diverse patient populations is broadly recognized. Patient advocacy is critical both to drive the science of IO, and to promote patient satisfaction. To capitalize on these opportunities, the Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer (SITC) has established a goal of at least 100 new, unique IO approvals over the next 10 years. Accordingly, SITC has developed initiatives designed to integrate the viewpoints of diverse stakeholders and galvanize the field in further adapting clinical trials to the unique features of IO, moving us closer to our ultimate goal of using IO to cure and prevent cancer.",Hoffner B; Perlmutter J; Szczepanek C; Romero PJ; Emens LA,Kaiser Permanente; Advanced Practitioner Society for Hematology and Oncology; Cancer Research Consortium of West Michigan (CRCWM); Novigenix SA; Gemini Group,emensle@icloud.com.

Using newly compiled international databases, we aimed to analyse global greenhouse gas emissions from pharmaceutical consumption and production over time and across supply chains. We quantified the pharmaceutical greenhouse gas footprint across 77 regions from 1995 to 2019 using environmentally extended multi-regional input-output (EE-MRIO) analysis, then conducted structural decomposition analysis to assess key drivers. To identify producers' full supply chain emission responsibility and mitigation opportunities, we performed structural path analysis and assessed scope 1-3 emissions, supported by a Sankey diagram visualisation. Our analysis was based on data from the EE-MRIO database developed by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (Inter-Country Input-Output tables 2023) and validated using the EE-MRIO database developed by Eurostat (FIGARO-2024). From 1995 to 2019, the global pharmaceutical greenhouse gas footprint grew by 77%. This increase was primarily driven by rising pharmaceutical final expenditure, especially in China, and efficiency gains stalling after 2008. High-income countries contributed, on average, a nine-times to ten-times higher pharmaceutical greenhouse gas footprint per capita than lower-middle-income countries in 1995-2019. Supply chain emissions varied substantially among major suppliers in intensity, overseas displacement, and upstream effects. Greenhouse gas emissions related to pharmaceuticals have risen substantially and are likely to continue to rise without concerted and coordinated action. Pharmacies and researchers should investigate sources of unnecessary pharmaceutical use and waste, the industry should improve supply chain efficiency, governments should promote pharmaceutical waste reduction programmes, and international organisations must support global mitigation efforts, especially given the growing importance of scope 3 emissions and international outsourcing.

However, a comprehensive analysis of CDC7 across multiple cancers is lacking, and existing therapeutic options have come with limited clinical success. The aim of this is to integrate a comprehensive pan-cancer analysis of CDC7 with the identification of novel marine-derived inhibitors, bridging the understanding of CDC7's role as a prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target across diverse cancer types. In this study, we conducted a pan-cancer analysis of CDC7 across 33 tumor types using publicly available datasets to evaluate its expression, genetic alterations, immune interactions, survival, and prognostic significance. Additionally, a marine-derived compound library of 31,492 molecules was screened to identify potential CDC7 inhibitors using chemoinformatics and machine learning. The top candidates underwent rigorous evaluations, including molecular docking, pharmacokinetics, toxicity, Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations, and Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations. The findings revealed that CDC7 is overexpressed in several cancers and is associated with poor survival outcomes and unfavorable prognosis.

In this study, we evaluated the genotoxic potential of two structurally related nitrosamines: N-nitrosomorpholine (NMOR) and N-nitroso reboxetine. Compared to the well-studied NMOR, there is little toxicological information available for N-nitroso reboxetine. Currently, both compounds have an acceptable intake value of 127 ng/day, based on a read-across using the available carcinogenicity data of NMOR. While both compounds tested positive in a series of in vitro and in vivo assays, we found that the mutagenic potential of N-nitroso reboxetine was significantly lower than that of NMOR. The benchmark dose (BMD) analysis of in vivo mutagenicity data supports an acceptable intake of 24,000 ng/day for N-nitroso reboxetine. Computational studies, carried out using the quantum-mechanical CADRE program, were consistent with in vitro and in vivo outcomes, suggesting an acceptable intake at or above 1500 ng/day for N-nitroso reboxetine. In comparison to NMOR, this prediction is supported by lower computed reactivity in the hydroxylation step, greater steric hindrance of the alpha carbons, and more facile proton transfer in the heterolysis toward the aldehyde metabolite. The data presented in this work can be used to refine and improve the Carcinogenic Potency Categorization Approach (CPCA).

In this study, we measured the photosynthetic characteristics of Ulva lactuca exposed to varying Cu concentrations and different temperatures (10 °C, 15 °C, and 20 °C). The results indicated that at the same temperature, as the concentration of Cu increased, the relative growth rate of U. lactuca showed a decreasing trend. Under three different temperatures, the photosynthetic rate and chlorophyll content of the algae significantly decreased with the increase in Cu concentration. Under the same Cu concentration conditions, as the temperature rises, the RGR of the algae gradually increases.

Its role in improving crop productivity and plant disease management and promoting growth in both ex-vitro and in-vitro conditions has been discussed, as have chitosan-based nanoformulations as plant growth promoters and biocides. Further research could unlock chitosan's potential to enhance food security, environmental sustainability, and sustainable agriculture. Future research should be directed toward enabling chitosan's broader applications beyond food technology and agriculture. An integrated effort among academic institutions, research centres, and regulatory bodies is needed to bridge the gap between innovation and practical implementation. These efforts include joint research initiatives, policy framework development, capacity building, public-private partnerships, harmonization of standards, and fostering collaboration between industries and regulatory agencies. These efforts aim to validate new technologies, establish shared databases, streamline approval processes, and ensure research outcomes are translatable into regulatory and commercial frameworks.",Johnson TS,Formerly Associate Research Director and Professor of Biotechnology,giridharp@cftri.res.in.

In a fully randomized design, A total number of 360 - unsexed - broiler chicks (Ross 308 strain) at the age of one day, were divided into six experimental groups. Every group was further divided into 6 replicates (10 chicks per replicate). The treatments included: NC group (birds fed standard diet only), PC (birds fed standard diet + antibiotic Colistin® at a level of 0.5 g /kg), LA2, LA4 (standard diet + LA at levels of 2 and 4 cm³ /kg, respectively), and HM2, HM4 (standard diet + HM at levels of 2 and 4 g /kg, respectively). The HM was composed of: 300 g of thyme powder (Thymus vulgaris), 300 g of hot red pepper (Capsicum annuum), 300 g of rosemary (Salvia rosmarinus), 150 g of anise (Pimpinella anisum), 150 g of spearmint (Mentha spicata), 300 g of black cumin seed (Nigella sativa), and 300 g of garlic powder (Allium sativum). A nonsignificant (p > 0.05) differences were detected in broiler live body weight (LBW) among the treatments. However, there was substantial improvement (P < 0.05) in daily body weight gain (DBWG) in the 22-32-day period. Feed intake (FI) and feed conversion ratio (FCR) were also significantly influenced (P < 0.001) during the 22-32-day period and across the entire 1-32-day experimental period. Although absolute spleen and gizzard weights were significantly enhanced (P < 0.05), other carcass traits were unaffected. Serum biochemical indices and antioxidant enzyme activities were remarkably improved (P < 0.001, and P < 0.05) across all treatment groups. Additionally, supplementation with these feed additives significantly impacted caecal microbial load, the HM4 group displayed the highest scores of total bacterial counts (TBC) and Lactobacilli.

Traditional chemotherapies lack specificity, leading to damage in normal tissues and severe side effects, highlighting the urgent need for targeted therapeutic strategies. In this study, copper and calcium co-doped carbon dots (Cu/Ca-CDs) were synthesized using a vacuum-confined heating method. These Cu/Ca-CDs demonstrated excellent tumor-targeting ability through specific binding to folate receptors on murine squamous cell carcinoma cell line (SCC7), facilitated by their pterin ring structure. Mechanistic studies revealed that Cu/Ca-CDs induced SCC7 tumor cell death through copper-induced cuproptosis and calcium overload-mediated apoptosis, as confirmed by Western blot, immunofluorescence staining, and Rhod-2 calcium probe analyses. The dual-mode imaging capability of Cu/Ca-CDs, enabled by fluorescence and computed tomography properties, allowed for real-time tracking of their distribution and accumulation within tumors. This imaging-guided approach ensured precise delivery to tumor tissues while minimizing damage to normal tissues. In vivo experiments demonstrated significant tumor volume reduction and increased survival rates in tumor-bearing mice treated with Cu/Ca-CDs, without any observed toxicity to normal tissues or changes in body weight, underscoring the efficacy and biosafety of Cu/Ca-CDs. These findings highlight Cu/Ca-CDs as a promising strategy for precision oncology, offering effective tumor targeting, dual-mode imaging, and synergistic anti-tumor efficacy with reduced side effects.",,,zhouding@jlu.edu.cn.

Sanghuangporus, a natural medicinal mushroom, contains flavonoids that may increase immune cell activity, potentially improving human health. This study investigated the immunomodulatory effects of Sanghuangporus flavonoids (PBF) via network pharmacology and in vitro and in vivo experiments. Network pharmacology identified PBF compounds targeting 46 immunosuppression-related targets, with rutin emerging as a key component. Molecular docking confirmed the strong binding affinity of rutin for the core targets IL6, TNF, and IL1B. In vitro, PBF activated mouse macrophages, promoting their proliferation, phagocytic activity, NO production, and cytokine regulation. In vivo, PBF enhanced immune function in normal mice by promoting thymus and spleen growth, increasing cellular and humoral immunity, and restoring immune function in immunosuppressed mice. These findings highlight the potential of PBFs in increasing immunity and treating immunosuppressive diseases.",,,12017024@zju.edu.cn.

The role of direct-to-physician marketing in accelerating uptake of GDMT is unknown. The authors investigated the association between industry marketing meals and GDMT prescribing rates under Medicare Part D. The authors linked Medicare data sets to identify general and advanced heart failure (AHF) cardiologists' prescriptions for angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitors (ARNIs), sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2is), angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs), and beta-blockers from 2019 to 2021. Using negative binomial regression analyses, they examined the association between marketing meals and prescribing rates of marketed and un-marketed classes of GDMT. Of 11,277 general and 329 AHF cardiologists, 60% received marketing payments for ARNI and 50% for SGLT2i from 2019 to 2021. Among general cardiologists, but not AHF cardiologists, exposure to ARNI marketing meals in 2020 was associated with a greater prescribing volume of ARNI in 2021 (1-4 ARNI meals; relative ratio: 1.43 [95% CI: 1.34-1.53]; 5-9 ARNI meals; relative ratio: 1.69 [95% CI: 1.48-1.93]; ≥10 ARNI meals; relative ratio: 2.09 [95% CI: 1.80-2.43]). Findings were similar for SGLT2i. The association between marketing and prescribing of other pillars of GDMT was inconsistent across drug classes. Neither ARNI nor SGLT2i marketing was consistently associated with increased prescribing of MRAs. Industry marketing to general cardiologists is associated with increased uptake of ARNIs and SGLT2is, but not with increased uptake of all pillars of GDMT. Improvements in comprehensive therapy for heart failure will require other mechanisms to accelerate uptake of MRAs and beta-blockers, as well as ARNIs and SGLT2is once multiple generic formulations become available in the United States.",,,dkazi@bidmc.harvard.edu.

Medium-chain triglycerides (MCT) are composed of three fatty acids attached to a glycerol backbone and have shown several beneficial effects in various neurological diseases. The present study investigated MCT supplementation's impact on seizure severity and associated neurobehavioral comorbidities in a pentylenetetrazole (PTZ) mouse kindling model. Mice were administered 35 mg/kg (i.p.) of PTZ every other day for kindling induction. The kindled mice were then subjected to MCT supplementation for over 25 days with seizure scoring at every 5th day following PTZ exposure. Behavioral analysis was initiated at the end of 25 days of the MCT supplementation. After that, lipid peroxidation assay, and, gene and protein expression studies were performed in the isolated hippocampus. MCT significantly decreased seizure severity scores compared to control. The treatment reduced immobility duration in the forced swim and tail suspension tests, indicating a reversal of seizures-associated depression-like behavior. A significant reduction in the percentage of spontaneous alternation was observed in the kindled control group in the T-maze test, which remained unchanged following MCT supplementation in the treated group. Furthermore, no change was observed in the locomotion and anxiety index of the kindled mice supplemented with MCT compared to the control group. In addition, the supplementation attenuated the altered hippocampal lipid peroxidation, and mRNA and protein levels of mTOR and Gsk-3β. The study concluded that MCT supplementation suppresses epileptic seizures and associated depression-like behavior in kindled mice via interacting mTOR and Gsk-3β signaling.",,,

Brazilian recommendations are unclear about TBI screening and its preventive treatment (TPT) in persons with IMID. To provide a comprehensive and evidence-based guideline for managing TBI in persons with IMID in Brazil. This task force was constituded by 42 specialists with interest in IMID and TBD. A core leadership team (CLT) drafted fourteen clinical questions on the risk of tuberculosis and indications of TPT among persons with IMID who started, or are about to start immunosuppressive drugs. The CLT supervised the systematic reviews and formulated the recommendations. The experts voted using the Delphi Method. Nine recommendations were established. More than 80% of panelists voted ""agree"" and ""strongly agree"" with all statements. In brief, all persons with IMID starting or about to start immunosuppressive treatment should undergo tuberculin skin testing (TST) or interferon-gamma release assays (IGRAs), a chest imaging test and investigation of contact with active pulmonary or laryngeal TBD. TPT is mandatory for those with any positive result after excluding TBD. Exceptions include individuals with a history of TBD or a past positive TBI infection test. IGRA is preferred only in persons BCG-vaccinated in the past 2 years. Those with inconclusive IGRA results can have the test repeated once, and TPT should be offered if it remains indeterminate. TST or IGRA should be repeated yearly, for three years, when the previous test was negative, when starting or changing to a different class of immunosuppressive drug. Overall, the included studies had a low quality of evidence and high risk of bias. These guidelines are meant to improve the management of TBI in IMID.

This study thoroughly examines the behavior of MPs/NPs, including their sources, entry routes into plants, phytotoxicity under various biotic and abiotic stresses (e.g., salinity, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, heavy metals, antibiotics, plasticizers, nano oxide, naturally occurring organic macromolecular compounds, invasive plants, Botrytis cinerea mycorrhizal fungi.) and controlling strategies. MPs/NPs in agricultural systems mainly originate from mulch, sewage, compost fertilizer, municipal solid waste, pesticide packaging materials, etc. They enter plants through endocytosis, apoplast pathways, crack-entry modes, and leaf stomata, affecting phenotypic, metabolic, enzymatic, and genetic processes such as seed germination, growth metabolism, photosynthesis, oxidative stress and antioxidant defenses, fruit yield and nutrient quality, cytotoxicity and genotoxicity. MPs/NPs can also interact with other environmental stressors, resulting in synergistic, antagonistic, or neutral effects on phytotoxicity. To address these challenges, this review highlights strategies to mitigate MPs/NPs toxicity, including the development of novel green biodegradable plastics, plant extraction and immobilization, exogenous plant growth regulator interventions, porous nanomaterial modulation, biocatalysis and enzymatic degradation.

To manage FOC in an environmentally friendly and sustainable manner, the current studies were carried out in 2023 and 2024, and emulsion-based bioformulations of two potential Trichoderma isolates, T. harzianum AMUTH-1 and T. viride AMUTV-1 were prepared and tested under field conditions. For comparison, Pseudomonas fluorescens AMUPF-1, Grow-Power™ (commercial bioagent) and fungicide (carbendazim) were used as benchmarks. Field studies have shown that chickpea variety RVG-202 was highly susceptible to FOC and developed severe wilt at the vegetative stage. However, application of the emulsion-based bioformulation of T. harzianum significantly reduced the wilt severity (55%) and enhanced the plant growth and yield of chickpea by 23-33% and 31%, respectively. The effect of this emulsion formulation was also at par with fungicide, carbendazim and commercial bioagent, Grow-Power™.

Artichoke (Cynarascolymus L.) is a conventional edible botanical remedy known for its diverse pharmacological attributes, including antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. In this study, we aimed to investigate the effects of artichoke water extract (AWE) on Pb-induced liver toxicity and the potential underlying mechanisms. We identified and quantified the chemical compounds in AWE using ultra-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS). Fifty male C57BL/6J mice (8-week-old) were randomly divided into five groups with ad libitum access to a standard diet and water. Over six weeks of experiments, the control group was orally administered 100 μL/day of distilled water. The Pb group received orally a Pb solution at 25 mg/kg body weight (BW)/day. The Pb + AWE (0.8) group received a combination of Pb solution (25 mg/kg BW) and AWE (0.8 g/kg BW) daily. Next, the Pb + AWE (1.6) group received a combination of Pb solution (25 mg/kg BW) and AWE (1.6 g/kg BW) daily. The Pb + vitamin C group received a combination of Pb solution (25 mg/kg BW) and vitamin C (50 mg/kg BW) daily. We evaluated tissue Pb levels, serum biochemical indices, liver function parameters, and histopathology post-experiment. HepG2 cells were cultured to investigate AWE's role and underlying mechanism of action on Pb-induced pyroptosis. Ninety-six major compounds were identified and quantified in AWE using UPLC-MS/MS. Treatment with AWE at 0.8 and 1.6 g/kg body weight (BW) significantly reduced tissue Pb accumulation, induced fecal Pb excretion, improved lipid profiles, and attenuated liver injury. In addition, AWE treatment increased superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activity and decreased malondialdehyde (MDA), 8-OHdG production, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin (IL)-6, and IL-1 beta expression in Pb-exposed mice and HepG2 cells. Mechanistically, the in vivo and in vitro results showed that AWE's antioxidant role was related to the activation of nuclear factor-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) signaling. Its anti-inflammatory effect was associated with the inhibition of Pb-induced pyroptosis by inhibiting the nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-like receptor pyrin domain-containing protein 3 (NLRP3)/caspase-1/gasdermin D (GSDMD) pathway. These findings indicate that AWE protects against Pb-induced liver toxicity potentially through its chelating, antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory properties.",,,xiaoweid712@163.com.

This study explores the effects of cooked rice starch on glycometabolism in rats to explore the role of high glycemic index (GI) carbohydrates in the daily diet. Utilizing X-ray diffraction and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy allowed the structure of amorphous starch to be probed, while rats were subjected to a long-term pre-prandial gavage intervention (glucose as a positive control and normal saline as a negative control) to assess the effects of high GI carbohydrates on glucose tolerance, insulin sensitivity, and markers of glucose metabolism in skeletal muscle (SIRT1, PGC-1α, GSK-3β, GLUT4). Results showed that high-GI carbohydrates significantly enhanced systemic insulin sensitivity, glucose tolerance, and skeletal muscle glucose metabolism. Waxy rice starch (WRS), containing a high amylopectin content (98.57 %), was found to be particularly effective due to its high rapidly digestible starch (RDS) content (66.01 %) and a GI of 102 after cooked into an amorphous state. Consequently, it can be concluded that a long-term moderate intake of amorphous rice starch induces the body to increase insulin sensitivity and improve glycometabolism.

To investigate its effects on chronic colonic inflammation and elucidate the underlying mechanisms, a mouse model was employed to assess oral exposure to fluxapyroxad at no observed adverse effect level (NOEL) for 13 weeks, in vitro and in silico models were utilized as well. The results revealed reduced body weight gain, colon length reduction, crypt damage, goblet cell loss in the colon, impaired intestinal barrier integrity, and an elevation of proinflammatory cytokines, including IL-6, IL-1β, and TNF-α following fluxapyroxad exposure in mice. These findings suggested that fluxapyroxad induced chronic colonic inflammation. Furthermore, fluxapyroxad decreased interleukin 22 levels and antibacterial peptide secretion by inhibiting Aryl hydrocarbon receptors (AhR) activation, which was confirmed in vitro experiments. Molecular docking analysis indicated that fluxapyroxad spontaneously formed halogen bonds and bound hydrophobic interactions with AhR, which might act as an AhR inhibitor.

Plasma Protein Binding (PPB) and Blood-Brain Barrier (BBB) permeability may have a positive effect on Central Nervous System modulating (CNS). There is a minimal chance of it being a substrate for cytochrome P2D6 (CYP). Except for a ""very slight risk"" for eye corrosion and eye irritation, none of the well-known toxicities in valeric acid were anticipated, which was compatible with wet-lab data. The molecule possesses no environmental hazard as analyzed with common indicators such as bio-concentration factor and LC50 for fathead minnow and daphnia magna. The toxicity parameters identified valeric acid as nontoxic to androgen receptors, antioxidant response element, mitochondrial membrane receptor, heat shock element, and tumor suppressor protein (p53), except Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor- gamma (PPAR-γ) was found to be medium toxicity. However, no toxicophores were found out of seven parameters. Overall, the ADMETLab evaluated that valeric acid has favorable pharmacokinetic and drug-likeness profiles, making it a promising drug candidate for new drug development.",,,

Diet, oxidative stress, and the gut microbiota all play critical roles in the development of AD. Recent studies suggested a bidirectional relationship between the gut and the brain, emphasizing the pivotal role of the gut microbiome in influencing cognitive functions. For instance, dysbiosis, a disruption in the balance of gut microbial communities, has been linked to neuroinflammation and the accumulation of amyloid-beta plaques, hallmark features of AD. Oxidative stress, arising from an imbalance between free radicals and antioxidants, contributes significantly to AD pathology. The molecular mechanisms through which oxidative stress impacts neuronal health and exacerbates the cognitive decline in AD patients are also relevant. Moreover, nutritional interventions emerge as promising strategies to modulate these inflecting factors. Dietary components, such as antioxidants, omega-3 fatty acids, and polyphenols, exhibit neuroprotective effects, potentially mitigating AD progression. In contrast, the Western diet has a high potential to abet AD onset. Mediterranean diet and/or intermittent fasting are more valuable diets that may help delay the AD onset or progression. Limitations like individual differences affect the efficacy of nutritional interventions. As a supporting therapy, personalized diets should be applied according to the patients' special needs/microbiomes in the future. To gather current knowledge on the interconnected roles of the gut microbiome, oxidative stress, and nutritional interventions in AD is crucial. Understanding these interactions may pave the way for novel therapeutic approaches, as well as disputing the potential diets that can help improve AD patients' quality of life.",,,

These changes result in hypofunction of salivary gland which has a significant impact on the quality of life of head and neck cancer patients who treated with radiotherapy. Nevertheless, no preventive method has been found. Metformin, a diabetes drug, has recently attracted considerable attention because it can cause tissue regeneration by anti-inflammatory action and influencing stem cells. This study examined the effects of metformin on salivary gland tissue damage caused by radiation therapy. Cultured human parotid epithelial cells are irradiated with 15 Gy of 4MV X-rays. The analysis including DNA damage, inflammatory markers and proliferation, is conducted to confirm the effect of metformin. Similarly, an in vivo mouse model is established. Histologic and functional analyses, such as salivary flow rate and lag time, are performed. The in vitro experiment revealed irradiation increased DNA damage, NF-кB, IL-6, and apoptosis with reduced proliferation. The treatment with metformin decreased the radiation-induced DNA damage and inflammation, and increased proliferation. The in vivo model also shows the same results. The group taking metformin after irradiation has preserved salivary gland parenchyma compared to irradiation only group, and the functional analysis results are comparable to the normal group. Histologic and functional analysis shows that metformin reduced radiation-induced hypofunction of salivary gland. Hence, metformin can be used to prevent radiation-induced salivary gland dysfunction.",,,

Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) is a critical mediator of inflammatory responses within the retinal environment. This study has investigated TNF-α's influence on inflammatory cytokine production and endothelial barrier integrity in human microglial (HMC3) and endothelial (HUVEC) cells. We found that TNF-α significantly elevated the expression and secretion of interleukin-6 (IL-6) and interleukin-1β (IL-1β) in HMC3 cells and disrupted endothelial tight junctions in HUVECs, as evidenced by weakened ZO-1 staining and compromised barrier function. To mitigate these effects and further investigate the in vitro mechanism of actions in CRG-01's in vivo therapeutic efficacy of anti-inflammation, we employed AAV2-shmTOR, CRG-01, as the candidate for therapeutic vector targeting the mammalian target of the rapamycin (mTOR) pathway. TNF-α-induced IL-6, IL-1β, and NF-κB signaling in HMC3 cells were significantly reduced by AAV2-shmTOR treatment, which may present a promising avenue for the fight against AMD. It also effectively preserved endothelial tight junction integrity in TNF-α-treated HUVECs, providing reassurance about its effectiveness. Furthermore, the supernatant medium collected from AAV2-shmTOR-treated HMC3 cells decreased oxidative stress, protein oxidation, and cytotoxicity in ARPE retinal pigment epithelial cells. These results strongly suggested that CRG-01, the candidate therapeutic vector of AAV2-shmTOR, may have a therapeutic potential to treat AMD-related retinal inflammation.",,,keerang.park@cdmogen.com.

Currently, Novo Nordisk's icodec is the sole insulin available on the market that requires administration only once a week. Insulin icodec, developed by Novo Nordisk through amino acid mutations and fatty acid side chain modifications, has demonstrated the capability to control blood glucose levels on a once-weekly basis. To improve its efficacy, we modified the acylation side chain of icodec to generate insulin analogs appropriate for weekly dosing. A promising insulin analog, TBE001-A-S033, was synthesized and conjugated, and its efficacy was assessed in ICR and db/db mice. TBE001-A-S033 prolonged blood glucose control in ICR mice and exhibited a comparable blood glucose trend to insulin icodec in db/db mice. These findings suggest that TBE001-A-S033 possesses a favorable hypoglycemic effect and a differential half-life across species compared to insulin icodec, indicating its potential for once-weekly use in humans. This preclinical investigation indicates that TBE001-A-S033 may serve as an effective therapeutic for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).",Zhang C; Xu H; Xia C,Chia Tai Tianqing Pharmaceutical Group Co.,fengjdmr@163.com.

These diseases are treated using antibacterial drugs. Antibiotics are drugs that act by inhibiting bacterial growth or promoting the death of microorganisms. Their indiscriminate use is considered one of the main factors in the emergence of bacterial resistance, which is currently a major public health problem. Among the alternatives for controlling resistance is the search for new drugs, which are mainly based on the use of natural products with known bioactivity. These include Hecogenin Acetate, a sapogenin with significant anti-inflammatory, antifungal and antimicrobial activity. In order to evaluate HA's ability to modulate the antimicrobial activity of commonly used antibiotics, tests were carried out using the microdilution technique with bacterial strains of clinical interest. Hecogenin Acetate was found to be predominantly potentiating the antibiotic action, demonstrating that the association of Hecogenin Acetate with antibiotics presents a potential for innovative treatment, requiring further evaluation for the probable development of new antibacterial drugs.

The most common dissolution apparatuses are the USP apparatuses I and II, for which in silico tools have been previously developed for predictive dissolution modeling (PDM). While apparatuses I and II serve the greater volume of projects, apparatus III offers higher agitation levels and multivessel capabilities, which is critical for certain projects, and the physics of which have not been previously characterized. To mitigate that knowledge gap, the present work characterizes the transport physics and thermodynamics of dissolution apparatus III, such that a 1-D model is established and validated which scales release kinetics with agitation level across apparatuses I, II, and III. The resulting PDM is calibrated with at least two dissolution experiments at different agitation levels, for a particular formulation-medium combination, after which release kinetics are predicted within the design spaces of the three apparatuses. Calibration data can come from experiments using a single apparatus or different apparatuses, while still predicting across all three apparatuses. Erosion-based formulations are used for validation.

Modulation of the endocannabinoid system by inhibiting MAGL provides a promising therapeutic strategy for various diseases. In this work, we identified five new MAGL inhibitors with the nitrile group by high-throughput screening using SCARdock, a protocol presented by us for covalent drug discovery. Compounds ZQ-4, ZQ-5, ZQ-6, and ZQ-7 inhibit MAGL activity in a time-dependent and concentration-dependent manner. Furthermore, ZQ-7 was confirmed to covalently bind with the residue Ser132 of MAGL. The nitrile group is a new covalent warhead that has never been used in previous covalent MAGL inhibitors. At last, the efficacy of the new MAGL inhibitors on inhibiting breast cancer cells was investigated.

Nevertheless, the role of the gut (which is acknowledged as being the largest immune organ) in the immunoreactive effects of polydopamine nanoparticles (PDA) on acute ischemic stroke remains inadequately understood. In addition to its function in nutrient absorption, the gut acts as a protective barrier against microbes. Systemic immune responses, which are triggered by the disruption of gut barrier integrity, are considered as one of the mechanisms underlying acute ischemic stroke, with the gut-brain axis (GBA) playing a pivotal role in this process. In this study, we used a PDA intervention in an ACI model to investigate ACI-like behavior, intestinal barrier function, central and peripheral inflammation, and hippocampal neuron excitability, thus aiming to elucidate the mechanisms through which PDA improves ACI via the GBA. Our findings indicated that as ACI mice experienced dysbiosis of the gut microbiota and intestinal barrier damage, the levels of proinflammatory factors in the serum and brain significantly increased. Additionally, the activation of astrocytes in the hippocampal region and neuronal apoptosis were observed in ACI mice. Importantly, our study is the first to provide evidence demonstrating that PDA effectively suppresses the neuroimmune interactions of the gut-brain axis and significantly improves intestinal epithelial barrier integrity. We hope that our discoveries will serve as a foundation for further explorations of the therapeutic mechanisms of PDA in ACI, particularly in elucidating the protective roles of gut microbiota and intestinal barrier function, as well as in the development of more targeted clinical interventions for ACI.",,,

Therefore, their dysregulation is closely associated with metabolic disorders, such as obesity and diabetes, as well as other pathological conditions, including inflammatory bowel diseases, cancer, and neurological disorders. Probiotics are commonly used to maintain a healthy gut microbiome, but their oral delivery is inefficient mainly due to their poor stability in the harsh gastrointestinal (GI) environment. This work presents an innovative encapsulation strategy, inspired by the natural structure of an egg, for the effective oral delivery of probiotics, termed PIE (Probiotics-In-Egg). The PIE technology is based upon encapsulating probiotics with phosvitin and ovalbumin derived from egg yolk and egg white, respectively.

Transient transfection of mammalian cells remains the most commonly used method to produce clinical-grade rAAVs due to its ease of implementation. However, transient transfection processes are often characterized by suboptimal yields and low fractions of full-to-total capsids, both of which contribute to the high cost of goods of many rAAV-based gene therapies. Our previously developed mechanistic model for rAAV2/5 production indicated that the inadequate capsid filling is due to a temporal misalignment between viral DNA replication and capsid synthesis within the cells and the repression of later phase capsid formation by Rep proteins. We experimentally validated this prediction and showed that performing multiple, time-separated doses of plasmid increases the production of rAAV. In this study, we use the insights generated by our mechanistic model to develop an intensified process for rAAV production that combines perfusion with high cell density re-transfection. We demonstrate that performing multiple, time-separated doses at high cell density boosts both cell-specific and volumetric productivity and improves plasmid utilization when compared to a single bolus at standard operating conditions.

Therefore, it is essential to understand the specific responses of the gut microbiota to dietary and seasonal variations in order to improve animal conservation strategies based on solid scientific knowledge. In summer, due to the higher nutritional quality of forage, Tan sheep exhibited enhanced forage degradation and fermentation. This was reflected by increased populations of key rumen bacteria, including Bacteroidetes, Prevotella_1, Prevotellaceae_UCG-003, Ruminococcus_1, Saccharofermentans, and Ruminococcaceae_UCG-014. Supplementation with cellulase further facilitated these processes, optimizing the utilization of available nutrients. In contrast, during winter, when the nutritional quality of forage decline, we observed lower indicators of forage degradation and fermentation in Tan sheep. Additionally, there was a significant increase in the Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio, microbial diversity, microbial interactions, and metabolic activity. The rumen microbiota adapts to enhance the breakdown of forage biomass and maintain energy balance during periods of inadequate nutritional value. Supplementing the diet with cellulase during these times can help mitigate the reduced digestibility associated with low-quality forage. This study highlights the dynamic adaptation of the rumen microbiota to seasonal variations in forage quality and emphasizes the potential benefits of cellulase supplementation in supporting rumen function and improving animal performance under varying environmental conditions.",,,cyhoufj@lzu.edu.cn.

Network pharmacology predicted the sleep-regulating effects of COS and COS oligosaccharides and identified sleep-related targets. Drosophila sleep analysis demonstrated that COS ameliorated caffeine-induced insomnia, and its efficacy was critically influenced by molecular weight. Specifically, COS30K exhibited superior effects compared to COS1K and COS3K in improving the nighttime sleep time, duration of sleep episode and number of sleep episodes in flies. These differential effects were primarily related to acetate-producing bacteria Acetobacter and polysaccharide-degrading bacteria (Bacteroides and Ruminococcus). Their influence on tryptophan metabolism (serotonin and kynurenine) may contribute to the molecular weight-dependent differences in sleep-regulating effects of COS. Integration of network pharmacology and transcriptomic analyses identified five crucial targets (Insc, Aox1, bgm, Acer and hll). This study provides a strategy for predicting novel biological activity of COS and COS oligosaccharides.",,,fexmguo@gmail.com.

A,10.1016/j.chroma.2025.465863,"Pyrrolizidine alkaloids (PAs) are plant toxins occurring in different foodstuffs, including teas, herbal infusions and species. Additionally, PAs may be transferred to honey and pollen when honeybees come into contact with contaminated plants. Due to their adverse effect, PAs occurrence in food must be controlled to ensure public health. Nevertheless, the presence of numeours PA epimers complicates their chromatographic separation and detection. In this regard, a method using liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrosmetry (LC-MS/MS) has been developed allowing the separation of 31 out of the 35 regulated PAs, which was sucessfully validated in different food matrices such as herbal infusions, spices and honey. Afterwards, travelling wave ion mobility spectrometry hyphenated with quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (TWIMS-QTOF) was evaluated to improve the analytical performance of PAs determination. Thus, collision cross section (CCS) values of PAs have been therefore obtained for the first time. The CCS library for PAs was also compared with predicted values by machine learning and with those meassured in real food matrices (bias <2 %). In addition, an in-house library was used in the suspect screening of PAs to complement the targeted analysis of the studied samples, all of which tested positive for several PAs.",Dreolin N; Foddy H,Waters Corporation,laura.carbonellrozas@unipr.it.

The high specific surface area of micronized particles renders them cohesive and adhesive. Addition of certain excipients like magnesium stearate has been reported to coat the particles and improve the aerosolization in the carrier-based DPI. Therefore, application of particle coating in DPI developments has been investigated and expanded over the years, along with the growing need of high-dose carrier-free DPIs. In addition to modifying inter-particulate forces, particle coating has also been demonstrated to effectively provide moisture resistance, modify particle morphology, improve the stability of biologics, alter dissolution behaviors for DPI developments. These different coating functions have been discussed in the current work. Moreover, various coating techniques including solvent-based coating, dry coating, and vapor coating, as well as coating characterization have been summarized in the present review. The extent of particle coating is critical to DPI performance; however, there is a demand for advanced characterization techniques to quantify and understand the coating quality.

However, they can impact non-target soil organisms. In this study, we investigated the effect of eight seed treatments (including two authorized for organic farming) on root colonization of winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) by arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi. One experiment was conducted in greenhouse conditions, on a sterile substrate inoculated with the AM fungus Rhizophagus irregularis MUCL 41833 and one in field conditions, where winter wheat was colonized by native soil AM fungi. In greenhouse conditions, the six conventional seed treatments reduced root colonization five weeks after sowing. No difference with the control treatment was measured thereafter for a product containing triazole alone. In contrast, seed treatments containing fludioxonil (fungicide molecule alone or formulated with the triazole difenoconazole), and prochloraz formulated with the triazole triticonazole significantly reduced root colonization until 11 weeks after sowing. Notably, when formulated with sedaxane, the adverse effect of fludioxonil was reduced. The negative effect of seed treatments on AM fungal root colonization in field was smaller than in the greenhouse and generally not significant, with disparate results from one timestep to another. This may be related to the dilution or the degradation of the active ingredients in the soil during the winter period or AM fungal species/strain involved in symbiosis. Overall, our results outline that the direct effect of seed treatment is highly variable depending on the modes of action, half-lives and interactions between active ingredients. By contributing to highlight the undesired effects of pesticides on AM fungi (i.e., by delaying root colonization), this study pleads for a reduction of pesticide applications to encourage the rapid and efficient establishment of functional mycorrhizal symbioses.",Brieuc H; Bruno H,Department of Sustainability,maryline.calonne@uclouvain.be.

To assess the contributions of components, we conducted a phase II trial evaluating 5-FU/platinum/trastuzumab and added pembrolizumab in cycle 2 in patients with metastatic HER2+ disease. Treatment-naïve patients with advanced HER2+ gastroesophageal cancer underwent a baseline biopsy and received a single dose of 5-FU/platinum with trastuzumab followed by repeat biopsy. Pembrolizumab was added, and a third biopsy was performed after six cycles. The primary endpoint was the objective response rate. Secondary endpoints included progression-free and overall survival. Exploratory biomarker analysis and dynamic changes in HER2 and PD-L1 were prespecified. Sixteen patients were enrolled. The objective response rate was 69%, and the median progression-free survival was 11.9 months. Serial whole-exome, single-cell RNA, T-cell receptor sequencing, and spatial transcriptomics from pretreatment and on-treatment samples revealed early trastuzumab-induced NK cell infiltration in HER2+ tumor beds and an increase in Fc receptor gamma III expression in macrophages, suggesting that trastuzumab directs Fc receptor-mediated antibody-dependent cytotoxicity. This favorable remodeling was enhanced by the addition of pembrolizumab, primarily in PD-L1+ samples. We observed TGF-β signaling in HER2-negative tumor regions, which was associated with nonresponder status. These data highlight the biology of intratumoral heterogeneity and the impact of tumor and immune cell features on clinical outcomes and may partly explain the lesser magnitude of pembrolizumab benefit in HER2+ and PD-L1-negative subgroups.",Heo YJ,Neocella Inc.,

Although dNTP imbalances reduce replication fidelity and elevate mutation rates, the impact of RNR dysfunction on Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) physiology and drug resistance remains unknown. Here, we constructed inducible knockdown strains for the RNR R1 subunit NrdE in Mtb and Mycolicibacterium smegmatis (Msm). NrdE knockdown significantly impaired growth and metabolic imbalances, indirectly disrupting oxidative homeostasis and mycolic acid synthesis, while increasing levels of intracellular ROS accumulation and enhancing cell wall permeability. Additionally, we developed genomic mutant strains, Msm-Y252A and Msm-Q255A, featuring targeted point mutations in the substrate-specific site (S-site) of the RNR loop domain, which determines NDP reduction specificity. The Msm-Y252A displayed a 1.9-fold decrease in dATP and increases in dGTP (1.6-fold), dTTP (9.0-fold), and dCTP (1.3-fold). In contrast, Msm-Q255A exhibited elevated intracellular levels of dGTP (1.6-fold), dTTP (6.1-fold), and dATP (1.5-fold), while dCTP levels remained unchanged. Neither the NrdE knockdown strain nor the S-site mutants exhibited direct resistance development; however, they both showed genomic instability, enhancing the emergence of rifampicin-resistant mutants, even with a 70-fold and a 25-fold increase in mutation frequency for Msm-Y252A and Msm-Q255A, respectively. This study demonstrates that NrdE is integral to Mycobacterium survival and genomic stability and that its RNR dysfunction creates a mutagenic environment under selective pressure, indirectly contributes to the development of drug resistance, positioning NrdE as an effective target for therapeutic strategies and a valuable molecular marker for early detection of drug-resistant Mtb.",,,

Unraveling the molecular basis of lipid or cholesterol homeostasis would help to identify novel drug targets and develop effective therapeutics. Here, we adopt a systematic approach to catalog the genes underlying lipid and cholesterol homeostasis by combinatorial use of high-throughput CRISPR screening, RNA sequencing, human genetic variant association analysis, and proteomic and metabolomic profiling. Such integrative multi-omics efforts identify gamma-glutamyltransferase GGT7 as an intriguing potential cholesterol and lipid regulator. As a SREBP2-dependent target, GGT7 positively regulates cellular cholesterol levels and affects the expression of several cholesterol metabolism genes. Furthermore, GGT7 interacts with actin-dependent motor protein MYH10 to control low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) uptake into the cells. Genetic ablation of Ggt7 in mice leads to reduced serum cholesterol levels, supporting an in vivo role of Ggt7 during cholesterol homeostasis.

In recent years, with the rapid development of industrialization, issues such as global warming and heavy metal pollution in the oceans have emerged, posing a serious threat to the life activities of marine organisms. In this study, we used transcriptomic techniques to investigate the differences in Cu exposure immune responses in S. esculenta larvae under different temperature conditions. The enrichment of solute carrier family (SLC) genes and genes related to DNA replication and damage was significantly higher in the CuT group than in the Cu group. Functional enrichment analysis revealed that the FcγR-mediated phagocytosis and autophagy pathways were enriched in the CuT group. Based on the analysis of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and functional enrichment results, we can preliminarily infer that the CuT group caused more severe disruption of intercellular ion transport and DNA replication and repair in larvae compared to the Cu group. This may have further interfered with the normal physiological activities of S. esculenta larvae. Overall, at high temperatures, Cu exposure induces a more intense inflammatory response. The results of this study provide a theoretical foundation for researchers to further understand the effects of environmental factors on the immunity of S. esculenta larvae, as well as preliminary insights into the enhanced toxic effects of metallic copper on aquatic organisms under high-temperature conditions.",,,lizanlxm@163.com.

The world has faced massive disruptions like COVID-19 and continues to suffer in terms of public health and world economy. Fighting with this emergence of viruses and its reemergence plays a critical role in the health care industry. Identification of novel virus-drug associations is a vital step in drug discovery. Prediction and prioritization of novel virus-drug associations through computational approaches is an alternative and best choice considering the cost and risk of biological experiments. This study proposes a method, KR-AEVDA that relies on k-nearest neighbor based reliable negative sample selection and autoencoder based feature extraction to explore promising virus-drug associations for further experimental validation. The method analyzes complex relationships among drugs and viruses by investigating similarity and association data between drugs and viruses. It generates feature vectors from the similarity data, and reliable negative samples are extracted through an effective distance-based algorithm from the unlabeled samples in the dataset. Then high level features are extracted via an autoencoder and is fed to an ensemble classifier for inferring novel associations. Experimental results on three different datasets showed that KR-AEVDA reliably attained better performance than other state-of-the-art methods. Molecular docking is carried out between the top-predicted drugs and the crystal structure of the SARS-CoV-2's main protease to further validate the predictions.

As additives, they can leach from products and are frequently found in both environmental and human biological samples. Previous studies have demonstrated that 2,4-DTBP exposure can impair the differentiation of human iPS cells into somite- and sclerotome-like cells, and reduce key processes involved in osteoblast formation. Therefore, the goal of this study is to determine if 2-BP, 4-BP, 2,4-DTBP, and its metabolite 3,5-di-tert-butylcatechol (3,5-DTBC) impacts the development of cartilage and bone in vivo, using zebrafish as a model organism. Zebrafish embryos were exposed to increasing concentrations of each of the four chemicals from 1 h post fertilization (hpf) until 5 days post fertilization (dpf), and analyzed for markers of bone and cartilage development. At their highest concentrations tested, both 2-BP and 2,4-DTBP altered axial skeleton formation, with 76% and 61% of the zebrafish showing spinal curvatures, respectively. To corroborate these changes, the expression of marker transcripts were examined. 2-BP exposure reduced mRNA expression of the bone mineralization marker sparc by 1.6-fold. In contrast, 2,4-DTBP increased sparc transcript expression by 1.4-fold. All four compounds significantly upregulated sox9a, a chondrogenesis marker, between 1.4- to 5-fold. Changes in tail cartilage formation were noted using Alician blue staining, with 2,4-DTBP reducing width, length, and cartilage area of the tail, while 2-BP reduced the tail width but with increased the tail base, yielding a more straightened tail. Principle component analysis (PCA) demonstrated associations between sox9a, sparc, nrf2a, reactive oxygen species (ROS), and tail cartilage measurements, particularly in the 2,4-DTBP exposures, suggesting the involvement of nrf2a signaling in impairing cartilage formation.

The simultaneous analysis of antibody mixtures in single animals, called cassette-dosing, could in principle overcome this bottleneck, but is currently limited to small cassette sizes. Here, we demonstrate how the use of genetically encoded peptide tags (flycodes), designed for maximal detectability in liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, can allow for the simultaneous characterization of large pools of drug candidates, from single cassette-dosed mice. We demonstrate the simultaneous assessment of PK parameters for a group of >20 marketed/development-stage antibodies.

The immunomodulatory imide drug (IMiD) class has shown potential in reducing neuroinflammation and switching microglial phenotypic expression away from a proinflammatory to a regenerative anti-inflammatory one. 3-Monothiopomalidomide (3-MP), a new IMiD, has a brain/plasma concentration ratio of 0.5 to 0.6, an oral bioavailability of 38.5%, and a monophasic disappearance of half-life 3.2 h following oral administration. 3-MP pretreatment mitigates lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammation in cellular human PBMCs and, in rat studies, 3-MP pretreatment lowers proinflammatory cytokine levels in the conditioned media and in plasma and the brain, respectively. Administered systemically to rats challenged with middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAo) and reperfusion, 3-MP post-MCAo treatment reduced infarction volume; improved body asymmetry, a behavioral measure of stroke impact; and lowered inflammation. In summary, 3-MP exerted neuroprotective effects via anti-inflammatory actions against MCAo-induced ischemic injury and represents a therapeutic that warrants further investigation as a treatment for brain damage and related disorders associated with excessive inflammation.",Hong E; Kim DS,Aevis Bio Inc,dskim@aevisbio.com.

The results demonstrated that FAE exhibited a stronger in vitro inhibitory effect on B. dothidea than FA and FAM, and offered superior preservation of kiwifruit quality after harvest. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images revealed that B. dothidea mycelium treated with FA, FAM, and FAE showed altered surface morphology, with signs of plasmolysis. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) further confirmed that FAE caused significant damage to the cell membrane and organelles of B. dothidea. Additional analyses using propidium iodide (PI) and calcofluor fluorescence white (CFW) staining, conductivity tests, and alkaline phosphatase (AKP) assays demonstrated that FA, FAM, and FAE treatments compromised cell membrane integrity. In addition, FAE treatment reduced the decay rate of kiwifruit, delayed the softening process and respiratory peak, maintained firmness, and prolonged antioxidant enzyme activity, preserving the fruit's quality over time. These findings suggest that FAE is a potent antifungal agent against B. dothidea with potential applications as an eco-friendly solution for controlling postharvest soft rot in kiwifruit. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: This study explores the antifungal properties of ferulic acid (FA), ferulic acid methylester (FAM), and ferulic acid ethylester (FAE), against Botryosphaeria dothidea, and their effects on the postharvest quality of ""Hongyang"" kiwifruit.

Swine acute diarrhea syndrome coronavirus (SADS-CoV), a bat coronavirus related to HKU2, causes severe economic losses in the pig industry and has the potential to trigger outbreaks in humans. However, our understanding of how SADS-CoV evades the host's innate immunity remains limited, hindering effective responses to potential human outbreaks. In this study, we demonstrate that the SADS-CoV envelope protein (E) inhibits type I interferon (IFN-I) signaling by inducing the degradation of STAT2 via the macroautophagy/autophagy-lysosome pathway. Mechanistically, the E protein evades host innate immunity by promoting STAT2 degradation through autophagy, mediated by the NBR1 and OPTN receptors. Notably, ubiquitination of E protein is required for the autophagic degradation of STAT2. Additionally, lysine residue K61 of the E protein is crucial for its stable expression; however, it is not involved in its ubiquitination. In conclusion, our study reveals a novel mechanism by which the E protein disrupts IFN-I signaling by targeting STAT2 via autophagy, enhancing our understanding of SADS-CoV's immune evasion strategies and providing potential drug targets for controlling viral infections.",,,

Post-approval safety activities on pregnancy and lactation are currently the main sources of information for product labeling to guide clinical practice. However, generating this information can take years, and the data often remains insufficient for healthcare providers and patients to make informed decisions. Given the differences in regulatory guidance on this issue and the evolving perspectives on the most appropriate types of post-approval activities on pregnancy and lactation, TransCelerate BioPharma conducted a survey of its member pharmaceutical companies to evaluate common post-approval practices over the past 11 years. All survey participants reported engaging in post-approval activities on pregnancy, citing pregnancy registries as the most common type of activity, followed by database studies and enhanced pharmacovigilance. These activities resulted in outcomes, including updates to the prescribing information, however these materialized after many years. Conversely, fewer post-approval activities on lactation were conducted, with limited impact on outcomes reported to date.

Herein, we developed a PEGylated retinoate self-assembled nanomicelles (FA-TP@VA NPs) modified with folic acid (FA) for inflammatory macrophage-targeted delivery of TP. FA-TP@VA NPs showed an appropriate size (192.70 ± 4.37 nm), good physical stability and high drug loading (79.83 ± 5.11 % for retinoate prodrug and 6.78 ± 0.13 % for TP). FA-TP@VA NPs exhibited high cellular uptake in M1 macrophages via folate-receptor pathway, thereby inhibiting their growth. Compared with TP, FA-TP@VA NPs could effectively inhibit synovitis and erosion of bone and reduce swelling and deformation of paws by downregulation of the levels of IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α. In ICA mice, FA-TP@VA NPs could enhance drug-specific enrichment in inflamed joints, effectively suppress hepatic oxidative stress and reduce systemic toxicity induced by TP.

A temperature-responsive smart nanofiber material with a shell-core structure, polyvinyl alcohol/poly(N-isopropylacrylamide)/polylactic acid/lemon essential oil (PPPL), was developed by incorporating lemon essential oil as a core-layer preservative and poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) as a temperature-responsive shell layer. Transmission electron microscopy confirmed the shell-core structure of the fibers. When the temperature exceeded the lower critical solution temperature, the water contact angle increased from 56° to 91°, confirming that PPPL was temperature-responsive. Infrared spectroscopy revealed interactions between the core and shell layers, which contributed to the tensile strength of 4.31 MPa and enhanced the material's water vapor barrier properties. Release studies indicated that the fibers effectively regulated lemon essential oil release, achieving a radical scavenging rate of 42 % within 24 h. Analysis of the release kinetics revealed temperature-dependent control and effective inhibition of Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli growth. Additionally, the PPPL fibers exhibited significant natural degradation after three months of incubation and showed no toxicity to zebrafish or BV2 mouse glial cells, confirming their environmental and biological safety. A raspberry preservation experiment further demonstrated that under fluctuating temperature conditions, the nanofiber membrane slowed postharvest deterioration in fruit quality.

However, the factors influencing EGFR-exp and the impact of EGFR-exp on tumor characteristics in patients with EGFRm LUAD remain unclear. Whole-exome and RNA sequencing were performed for patients with early- and advanced-stage EGFRm LUAD. The patients were classified into low or high EGFR-exp groups based on the median transcripts per million. We retrospectively examined the association between EGFR-exp, genomic characteristics, downstream EGFR signaling activity, tumor microenvironment (TME) status, and clinical outcomes. This study included 450 and 45 patients in the early- and advanced-stage cohorts, respectively. In both cohorts, the EGFR-exp low group exhibited a lower incidence of TP53 co-mutations and EGFR amplification and a higher incidence of EGFR subclonal mutations than the EGFR-exp high group. Furthermore, downstream EGFR signaling pathways, such as the MAPK signaling, were less activated in the EGFR-exp low group. However, this group showed significantly enriched adaptive immune response pathways (Q < 0.0001) and an immune-inflamed TME. Additionally, a low EGFR-exp was a significantly favorable factor for postoperative relapse (odds ratio [OR], 0.6; P = 0.04). However, in the advanced-stage cohort, a low EGFR-exp was a significant risk factor for non-responders to osimertinib (OR, 17.5; P = 0.03). In EGFRm LUAD, significant associations were observed between EGFR-exp levels and both EGFR signaling pathways and adaptive immune status, which in turn influence clinical outcomes.

The profound metabolic alterations often present in dysglycaemia significantly increase the risk of cardiovascular complications. While genetic susceptibility plays a crucial role in diabetes and its vascular complications, identifying genes and molecular mechanisms that influence both diseases simultaneously has proven challenging. A key reason for this challenge is the pathophysiological heterogeneity underlying these diseases, with multiple processes contributing to different forms of diabetes and specific cardiovascular complications. This molecular heterogeneity has limited the effectiveness of large-scale genome-wide association studies (GWAS) in identifying shared underlying mechanisms. Additionally, our limited knowledge of the causal genes, cell types and disease-relevant states through which GWAS signals operate has hindered the discovery of common molecular pathways. This review highlights recent advances in genetic epidemiology, including studies of causal associations that have uncovered genetic and molecular factors influencing both dysglycaemia and cardiovascular complications.

The quorum-quenching enzyme AiiA is believed to disrupt communication between cells by inactivating AHLs-based quorum sensing signals. Chitosan, a biopolymer derived from chitin, is widely used as a coating film to inhibit bacterial growth and prolong food shelf life. The present study aims to investigate the individual and combined effects of AiiA and chitosan on the preservation of strawberries. AiiA was synthesized in vitro and the reaction conditions for the degradation of AHLs signals were optimized at temperatures ranging from 20 to 60 °C and a pH of 8.0. The present study provides evidence that AiiA effectively inhibited the processes of biofilm development, production of exopolysaccharides, and extracellular protease activity in Enterobacter sp. and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa).

To elucidate the potential mechanism by which Pb and Cd accelerate bone aging and to screen effective protective agents, we determined the optimum concentrations of Pb and Cd to establish the aging models in vitro and in vivo. The successful establishment of aging models was confirmed through β-galactosidase (β-gal) staining, the detection of aging markers, and the evaluation of biomechanical parameters. Subsequently, the polysaccharides were extracted separately from seven plants and Atractylodes macrocephala polysaccharide (AMP) was confirmed to have the strongest effect on osteoblast proliferation. Therefore, we purified AMP to obtain a small molecular fragment called AMP1-1 and investigated its effect. It has been revealed that AMP1-1 could resist oxidative stress and promote the proliferation and differentiation of osteoblasts, thereby slowing apoptosis and alleviating cell senescence through the results of the β-gal staining and the analyses of the osteoblastic, antioxidant, apoptotic, and senescence indexes. The results in vivo suggested that AMP1-1 exerted a protective role in bone aging by inhibiting the above pathways.

Glycation significantly contributes to skin aging and the development of complications. Researchers are currently investigating various substances, particularly those from natural sources, to combat skin glycation. This study aimed to comprehensively evaluate the anti-glycation effect of a new natural combination, EBB, which includes (-)-epigallocatechin-3 gallate (EGCG), bamboo leaf flavonoids, and broccoli seed water extracts, using cell and animal models and to explore its potential anti-glycation mechanism. The components of EBB were identified using HPLC and UHPLC-MS/MS. Additionally, a glycation cell model induced by glyceraldehyde, advanced glycation end products (AGEs), and methylglyoxal was established in HaCaT cells to evaluate the efficacy of EBB in alleviating glycation. Differential genes, signalling pathways, and biological processes were analysed through RNA sequencing to explore the mechanisms of the anti-glycation effects of EBB, which were further validated using qRT-PCR and Western blotting. Finally, the protective effects of EBB against glycation and skin damage were assessed in zebrafish and mouse in vivo models through histological studies and the measurement of various skin physiological parameters. Glucoraphanin, Sinapine and orientin were identified in EBB, which effectively reduced the formation of AGEs and decreased the expression level of the RAGE protein in HaCaT cells. Transcriptomic analyses revealed that EBB regulated the expression of 576 differentially expressed genes. These genes were enriched in various biological processes, such as chronic inflammation and immune responses, and participated in the regulation of multiple signalling pathways, including TNF. Glycation upregulated the expression of the ROS1 gene and protein, while EBB reversed this effect. Furthermore, EBB attenuated the glycation response by downregulating the expression levels of proteins such as p-p38, p-ERK1/2, p-p65, and TNF-α. Additionally, the reduction of AGE accumulation by EBB was confirmed in a zebrafish model. Similarly, histological analyses of mouse skin tissue and various physiological parameters demonstrated that EBB significantly mitigated damage induced by glycation. Our results show that EBB effectively inhibited glycation reactions. The mechanism of action may involve the reduction of inflammation by downregulating the expression levels of RAGE and ROS1, thereby decreasing the accumulation of AGEs in keratinocytes and alleviating skin damage.

This study is the first to investigate the impact of deoxynivalenol (DON), the most common mycotoxin, on antibiotic resistance dynamics in gut microbiota, demonstrating that DON exposure significantly selects for ARB and ARGs. Results indicated that 80.69 % of the ARGs with the highest increase in the DON group were exclusive to gram-positive bacteria, particularly those related to daptomycin. DON exposure enhanced the expression of virulence factors in gram-positive bacteria and increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and membrane permeability, compromising bacterial integrity and amplifying resistance mechanisms. DON also boosted the diversity and co-occurrence of ARGs and mobile genetic elements (MGEs), potentially facilitating the horizontal transfer of resistance traits. Notably, the dominant bacterial species isolated from broiler gut microbiota was identified as Enterococcus faecalis, which exhibited clonal expansion of sequence type ST123. This ST123 clone accounted for 86 % of the DON group and was associated with an extensively drug-resistant (XDR) phenotype, showing resistance levels exceeding 128 μg/mL to last-resort antibiotics such as daptomycin, vancomycin, and linezolid. Additionally, DON upregulated the expression of critical daptomycin resistance genes (liaR, walK, liaS, mprF, and cls) in vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) isolates.

It has a wide range of anticancer properties, including participating in cell apoptosis, inhibiting invasion and angiogenesis, and acting synergistically with standard cytostatic agents in malignant tumors. A range of molecular mechanisms are involved in anticancer activity and include the following ones: activation of cell-cycle-related proteins and enzymes such as p53, p21, Bax, and pro-caspases 3 and 9, reduction of cyclin D1 and E, proapoptotic Bcl-2, MMP-9, and NF-kV, which decrease VEGF, leading to cell cycle arrest at G0/G1 phase and death of cancer cells. Other mechanisms inhibit several pathways: PI3K/AKT/mTOR, Notch, and Wnt, which are associated with downregulation of proliferation, invasion, metastasis, and angiogenesis. FA can induce activation of ROS, leading to DNA damage in cancer cells. In vitro and in vivo studies have demonstrated the significant antitumor activity of FA in breast cancer, particularly when used in combination with cytostatic agents. In vitro studies on cervical cancer cell lines have reported similar anticancer activity of FA. This includes inhibition of cell proliferation and induction of apoptosis by downregulating antiapoptotic proteins. A case-control study conducted in Italy found that men with histologically confirmed prostate cancer had notably lower levels of FA compared to controls. Molecular in vitro studies have suggested that FA may have various effects on the signaling pathways linked to a reduction in the risk of prostate cancer, and it may act in synergy with δ-tocotrienol, which is a derivative of vitamin E. In vivo and in vitro studies on colorectal cancer have demonstrated the effects of FA on the early development of this cancer-inhibition of abnormal crypt foci (ACF-aberrant crypt foci), as well as the reduction in cancer cell viability and apoptosis through molecular changes, mainly a decrease in EGFR expression. The poor water solubility of FA makes it an attractive candidate for use as nanoparticles.",,,

40076083,Engineering Hydrogels with Enhanced Adhesive Strength Through Optimization of Poly(Ethylene Glycol) Molecular Weight.,,Polymers,10.3390/polym17050589,"Hydrogels are extensively utilized in biomedical fields because of their remarkable properties, including biocompatibility, high water content, flexibility, and elasticity. However, despite substantial progress in hydrogel research, creating a hydrogel adhesive that integrates high stretchability, fatigue resistance, and reversible adhesion continues to pose significant challenges. In this study, we aimed to address these challenges by preparing hydrogels using a combination of acrylic acid, acrylamide, carboxymethylcellulose methacrylate, thiol-functionalized polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane, and poly(ethylene glycol) dimethacrylate (PEGDM). By systematically varying the molecular weight of PEG, we were able to precisely adjust the mechanical and adhesive properties of the hydrogels. Our research revealed that a PEG molecular weight of 2000 (resulting in P1 hydrogel) provided a notable adhesive strength of 717.2 kPa on glass surfaces. This performance is particularly impressive given the challenges associated with achieving high adhesive strength while maintaining other desirable hydrogel properties. Beyond its strong adhesive capabilities, the P1 hydrogel also demonstrated exceptional stretchability, support, and fatigue resistance. These characteristics are crucial for applications where the adhesive needs to endure repeated stress and deformation without losing effectiveness. The successful development of P1 hydrogel underscores its potential as a multifunctional adhesive material with a broad range of applications. The ability to tailor the properties of hydrogels through molecular weight adjustments offers a promising approach to creating advanced adhesive solutions that meet the demanding requirements of modern biomedical and industrial applications.",,,
40075820,Severe Acute Kidney Injury with Necrotizing Glomerulonephritis After Piperacillin/Tazobactam Therapy in a Patient with Peritonitis: A Case Report and Literature Review.,,"Diagnostics (Basel, Switzerland)",10.3390/diagnostics15050574,"Piperacillin/tazobactam (PT), a widely utilized broad-spectrum antibiotic, has been associated with acute kidney injury (AKI). Although the precise mechanism remains uncertain, and most cases of PT-associated AKI are mild, this report describes a rare and severe complication of PT, which manifested as severe AKI with necrotizing glomerulonephritis requiring hemodialysis. A 42-year-old man was transferred to the nephrology clinic due to progressive deterioration of kidney function. Prior to the transfer, the patient had been diagnosed with appendicitis complicated by peritonitis and received intravenous PT for 8 days. Baseline kidney function was normal, but serum creatinine subsequently increased to 7.2 mg/dL. Hemodialysis was initiated to address metabolic acidosis and edema. Kidney biopsy revealed severe acute tubular injury and necrotizing glomerulonephritis. Steroid therapy was initiated based on the biopsy findings, and serum creatinine returned to normal levels after 4 weeks of treatment. This case demonstrates that severe AKI with necrotizing glomerulonephritis can occur after PT use. Prompt kidney biopsy and the timely initiation of immunosuppressive therapy are essential for a favorable outcome.",,,
