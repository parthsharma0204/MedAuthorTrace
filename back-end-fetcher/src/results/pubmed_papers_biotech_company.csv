40388523,Synovial Gene expression after Hemarthrosis differs between FVIII-deficient mice treated with recombinant FVIII or FVIII-Fc Fusion Protein.,2025-05-19,PloS one,10.1371/journal.pone.0320322,"To investigate if FVIII-Fc Fusion protein (FcFVIII) may modulate inflammation and immune stimulation in hemophilic synovium via the Fc-portion of immunoglobulin used for half-life extension we performed gene expression profiling in FVIII-deficient mice. Hemarthrosis was induced by sub-patellar puncture in FVIII-KO mice, + /- periprocedural recombinant human (rh)FVIII,murine (m)FcFVIII, or mIgG2a. Synovium was harvested at baseline and on days (D) 3 and 14, followed by RNA extraction and sequencing, and histological analysis. RNASeq data were processed using standard protocols followed by differential gene expression (DGE) analysis. Functional enrichment analysis generated molecular pathways (KEGG and Reactome). To distinguish between on-target and off-target (related and unrelated to injury/bleed) effects the following groups were compared: i) Baseline vs. injured-saline, ii) injured-saline vs. injured-rhFVIII, iii) injured-saline vs. injured-mFcFVIII. Knee injury in FVIII-KO mice resulted in hemarthrosis, which was prevented by peri-procedural rhFVIII and mFcFVIII treatments. Only a small proportion of genes was affected by FVIII treatment, exhibiting overlap but also distinct differences between both FVIII-preparations. Acutely (D3), mFcFVIII had unique on-target effects related to immune and inflammatory regulation, whereas rhFVIII mostly affected mRNA and protein processing. On day 14, macrophage profiling indicated a transition from M1 to M2, and only mFcFVIII uniquely influenced pathways and genes associated with tissue remodeling and repair. Some mFcFVIII DGE patterns resembled mIgG2a patterns. Synovial vascular remodeling and cartilage health were better with mFcFVIII than rhFVIII. Interestingly, both FVIII-preparations exerted off-target effects on immune system pathways, albeit with temporal differences. These observations provide proof-of-principle that the type of FVIII preparation can influence synovial processes beyond acute hemostasis control, deserving exploration in the setting of joint bleed control in hemophilia.",,,
40383710,Foundations and Strategic Vision of the Canadian Translational Geroscience Network.,,"The journals of gerontology. Series A, Biological sciences and medical sciences",10.1093/gerona/glaf111,"Geroscience is an emerging interdisciplinary field that explores the biological connections between aging and the development of chronic diseases, with the ultimate goal of identifying interventions to extend healthspan and delay age-related conditions.

40382834,Stability of psychotic symptoms and safety in switching to aripiprazole once-monthly according to prior oral antipsychotic drugs.,,Schizophrenia research,10.1016/j.schres.2025.04.033,"Long-acting injectable aripiprazole has substantiated safety and efficacy in treating schizophrenia. However, interindividual variability in clinical response to aripiprazole, possibly linked to its D2 partial agonism and D2 upregulation due to prior antipsychotics, has been reported. This study assessed whether there would be symptomatic aggravations or adverse events in clinically stable patients with schizophrenia when switching from oral antipsychotics to aripiprazole once-monthly (AOM), considering prior antipsychotics: oral aripiprazole (Group I) or other D2 antagonists (Group II). This was a 20-week, prospective, open-label, multicenter trial. Clinically stable patients with schizophrenia were assigned to two groups based on their oral antipsychotic medication and received AOM every 4 weeks. The primary endpoint was a change from baseline in the total Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) score. Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were monitored. Altogether, 100 patients in Group I and 101 in Group II completed the study. The mean changes (±SD) from baseline in PANSS total score after switching to AOM were - 9.43 ± 9.79 in Group I (p < 0.0001) and - 4.04 ± 8.72 in Group II (p = 0.0102). Compared to Group I, in Group II, more sleep disturbance (p = 0.0243) and psychotic symptoms (p = 0.0042) TEAE emerged after AOM initiation, with both TEAEs resolving during the study. Psychotic symptoms TEAE was associated with faster tapering of the prior oral antipsychotics (p = 0.0269). Initiating AOM did not aggravate symptoms. Furthermore, AOM ameliorated psychotic symptoms without any significant adverse effect, regardless of their prior oral antipsychotics. However, patients previously treated with D2 antagonists may experience transient psychiatric TEAEs that can be minimized with longer cross-titration.",,,kwonjs@snu.ac.kr.
40382532,Silencing hnRNPD inhibits gastric cancer growth by increasing TXNIP-mediated oxidative stress.,,Discover oncology,10.1007/s12672-025-02667-0,"RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) are essential for controlling gene expression, and their dysregulation is a key factor in tumor development and progression. Heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein D (hnRNPD), a member of the hnRNP family of RBPs, is aberrantly expressed in various tumors. However, its role and underlying mechanisms in gastric cancer have not been determined. The expression patterns of hnRNPD in gastric cancer were analyzed using publicly available datasets and clinical specimens. The effects of hnRNPD on gastric cancer cell growth were assessed using the Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) and colony formation assays. Target genes regulated by hnRNPD were identified through RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) and RNA immunoprecipitation sequencing (RIP-seq). Elevated expression of hnRNPD was observed in gastric cancer, and this overexpression was associated with an unfavorable prognosis. Knocking down hnRNPD could suppress the growth of gastric cancer cells and enhance endogenous oxidative stress. Thioredoxin-interacting protein (TXNIP) was identified as a downstream target of hnRNPD. Further analysis confirmed that hnRNPD diminished TXNIP expression by binding to and destabilizing its mRNA. Moreover, silencing TXNIP reversed the decrease in cell growth and the increase in oxidative stress caused by hnRNPD knockdown. Our study highlights hnRNPD as a major contributor to gastric carcinogenesis. The knockdown of hnRNPD hinders gastric cancer growth by directly interacting with TXNIP, promoting its expression, and inducing oxidative stress. These findings suggest that hnRNPD may serve as a valuable target for the treatment of gastric cancer.",,,287849695@qq.com.

Evaluate factors associated with response to filgotinib over time. Patients from SELECTION (NCT02914522) receiving filgotinib 200 mg (FIL200) or 100 mg (FIL100), or placebo were included. Factors associated with partial Mayo Clinic Score (pMCS) were assessed post hoc using a mixed model for repeated measures (MMRM). The prognostic value of week 10 faecal calprotectin (FCP) was assessed versus week 58 outcomes; p values are nominal. The MMRM included 558 patients (FIL200, n = 199; FIL100, n = 172; placebo, n = 187). For filgotinib, factors associated with lower week 58 pMCS versus respective comparators (p < 0.05) included being biologic-naive, low baseline inflammatory burden (endoscopic subscore <3, C-reactive protein ≤3 mg/L), or week 10 histological remission, endoscopic subscore ≤1, rectal bleeding and stool frequency subscores of 0, Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire scores >170, and/or lower FCP concentration. The optimal prognostic week 10 FCP cut-off for a concurrent week 10 Mayo Clinic Score response was <250 µg/g; combined week 10 FCP <250 µg/g and pMCS remission had similar week 58 prognostic value for clinical remission as week 10 endoscopic response. Being biologic-naive, having low baseline inflammatory burden, or strong week 10 filgotinib responses were associated with lower pMCS over 1 year of treatment. FCP <250 µg/g and week 10 pMCS remission may reduce the need for follow-up endoscopy.",Jamoul C; Muller K; Taliadouros V; Oortwijn A,Biostatistics; Galapagos NV; Medical Affairs,edouard.louis@uliege.be.

Despite the potential to transform health care, financial and clinical infrastructure factors have limited their use. With the potential for better survival rates, improved quality of life, and fewer side effects, is it time to prioritize the development of innovative therapies in Africa? Using CAR T-cell therapies as an exemplar, this study examines whether implementing these therapies is feasible and what strategic shifts are required to make them viable across the continent. With proper clinical infrastructure and expertise, introducing these therapies could drive a medical ""leapfrog"" phenomenon in African health care, similar to how the telecommunications and mobile banking sectors have rapidly accelerated the continent's development.",,,cynthia.obiozor@gmail.com.
40376308,CKD-associated pruritus in haemodialysis: a road map for diagnosis and treatment.,,Clinical kidney journal,10.1093/ckj/sfaf096,"Of the wide range of symptoms affecting patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) on haemodialysis, CKD-associated pruritus is one of the most common and burdensome, occurring at moderate-to-severe intensity in 31%-40% of patients, significantly impacting multiple aspects of quality of life, and associated with increased healthcare utilization. Despite the distressing nature of this symptom, clinicians frequently underestimate its prevalence and it is under-reported by patients who may be unaware of the availability of effective treatment options. The identification and management of CKD-associated pruritus should form an essential aspect of patient-centred care; however, patients with CKD may have multiple causes of chronic itch including those of dermatological, systemic, neuropathic and psychogenic origin, and CKD-associated pruritus must be distinguished from these. Together with its highly variable presentation in patients on haemodialysis, the range of potential causes of itch makes differential diagnosis of CKD-associated pruritus challenging. The presence of bilaterally symmetrical and non-dermatomally distributed itching, commonly affecting the back, limbs, chest and head is characteristic of CKD-associated pruritus, although approximately 50% of patients report generalized pruritus. Secondary skin lesions (including excoriation, crusts, impetigo, lichenifications and prurigo also seen in dermatological conditions) may or may not be observed, and xerosis (dry skin) that may exacerbate itching is common. Here, we provide a pragmatic approach to the identification and differential diagnosis of chronic itching in CKD-associated pruritus with the aim of supporting the effective management of this highly distressing symptom in clinical practice.",Lanot A; Aucella F,Department of Nephrology and Dialysis; Normandie Université,

Glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists (GLP1-RAs) are treatments for diabetes and obesity that may also influence psychiatric outcomes. To conduct a meta-analysis of randomized placebo-controlled trials to evaluate psychiatric, cognitive, and QOL outcomes with GLP1-RA treatment. MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, and CENTRAL databases were searched from inception through June 24, 2024. Double-blind placebo-controlled trials comparing GLP1-RA to placebo in adults with overweight/obesity and/or diabetes, reporting on psychiatric, cognition, or QOL outcomes, were included. Data extraction was performed in parallel by 2 reviewers. Random-effects meta-analysis was performed. Effect size measures were log risk ratios (log[RR]) and standardized mean differences (Hedges g). The quality of studies was appraised using the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool (RoB2). Certainty of evidence was assessed via GRADEpro. Main outcomes were risk of psychiatric adverse events (serious and nonserious) and change in mental health symptom severity, health-related quality of life, and cognition. Eighty randomized clinical trials involving 107 860 patients were included in the meta-analysis. The mean (SD) age of participants across studies in the meta-analysis was 60.1 (7.1) years; 43 251 were female (40.1%) and 64 608 male (59.9%).

While MYC proteins have long been considered challenging drug targets due to their intricate structures, recent advances have led to the development of promising inhibitors. This review explores the role of MYC overexpression in promoting radiotherapy resistance in aggressive neuroendocrine malignancies through multiple mechanisms, including increased tumor cell invasion, enhanced DNA damage repair and oxidative stress management, pro-survival autophagy, survival of circulating tumor cells, angiogenesis, awakening from dormancy, and modulation of chronic inflammation and host immunity. Paradoxically, MYC overexpression can also enhance radiosensitivity in certain cancer cells by driving pro-apoptotic pathways, such as reactive oxygen species (ROS)-induced DNA damage that overwhelms cellular repair mechanisms, ultimately leading to cell death. Additionally, we provide a comprehensive summary of direct MYC inhibitors, detailing their current stage of preclinical and clinical development as novel anti-cancer therapeutics.

Antibody-IL-2 fusion proteins capable of preferential tumor localization have shown encouraging signs of activity in clinical trials; however, they typically cause side effects shortly after intravenous administration, which may limit escalation to curative doses. There is an urgent need to engineer IL-2 products with ""activity-on-demand"" able to mask on-target off-tumor IL-2 activity without compromising therapeutic efficacy. To design IL-2 biopharmaceuticals with ""activity-on-demand"", which would be non-toxic on administration but regain activity at the tumor site, we explored the therapeutic potential of the co-administration of signaling inhibitors with matched pharmacokinetic properties. In this work, we used the tumor-homing F8-IL2 fusion protein, specific to a splice variant of fibronectin, and masked off-tumor toxicity by co-administration of upadacitinib, which rapidly clears from circulation. Vascular leak syndrome was monitored by histopathological analysis, the extent of peripheral edema, and cytokine levels. Immune profiling of the tumors and secondary lymphoid organs was performed by flow cytometry. In immunocompetent tumor-bearing mice, the combinatorial treatment significantly improved tolerability without any detectable loss of therapeutic activity, protecting the mice from body weight loss, uncontrolled systemic cytokine release, and severe vascular leak syndrome manifestations, including peripheral edema. F8-IL2 efficiently controlled tumor growth and retained its immunological activity within the neoplastic mass, as evidenced by the massive natural killer and cytotoxic T-cell infiltrates.

The individual patient data (IPD) from ZUMA-1 (n = 101 infused patients) used the 60-month data-cut, while the REAL-TREND cohort data consisted of aggregate data and pseudo-IPD derived from digitized curves. The outcomes were overall survival (OS), complete response (CR) and overall response rate (ORR), as reported in REAL-TREND. The MAIC weights were derived using age ≥ 60, sex, proportion of fourth line or higher (4L+) patients, international prognostic index (IPI; 0-1 vs. 2 vs. 3 vs. 4-5), and refractory to SCT. Sensitivity analyses explored the use of the intention to treat population, alternative variable alignment and use of central review assessed response. Some baseline characteristics were similar across ZUMA-1 and REAL-TREND, such as age and IPI scores, but key differences included proportion of 4L + patients (69% vs. 9%), of ECOG performance score 0-1 (100% vs. 59%), and type of refractoriness. The MAIC models aligned on prior lines and refractoriness, while differences in ECOG performance scores were captured through IPI. The resulting effective sample size for ZUMA-1 was 31.1. The estimated hazard ratio for OS was 0.27 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.15-0.50) and sensitivity analyses led to similar estimates. Strong effects were estimated for both ORR (odds ratio: 20.76; 95% CI: 7.18-60.02) and CR (odds ratio: 15.25; 95% CI: 6.84-33.98). The comparative efficacy of axi-cel relative to historical SoC was similar to that observed in studies restricted to Western settings. By providing outcomes data within a population of Asian-descent, we can provide better economic modeling to support reimbursements and improved access.",Ball G; Ray MD; Li T; Limbrick-Oldfield EH; Popoff E; Kanters S,Kite; RainCity Analytics,

Many radiomic features derived from computed tomography (CT) are sensitive to variations across scanners, reconstruction settings, and acquisition protocols. In this phantom study, eight different CT reconstruction parameters were varied to explore image- and feature-level harmonization approaches to improve tissue classification. Varying reconstructions of an anthropomorphic radiopaque phantom containing three lesion categories (metastasis, hemangioma, and benign cyst) and normal liver tissue were used for evaluating two harmonization methods and their combination: (i) generative adversarial networks (GANs) at the image level; (ii) ComBat at the feature level, and (iii) a combination of (i) and (ii). A total of 93 texture and intensity features were extracted from each tissue class before and after image-level harmonization and were also harmonized at the feature level. Reproducibility and stability were assessed via the Concordance Correlation Coefficient (CCC) and pairwise comparisons using paired stability tests. The ability of features to discriminate between tissue classes was assessed by measuring the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. The global reproducibility and discriminative power were assessed by averaging over the entire dataset and across all tissue types. ComBat improved reproducibility by 31.58% and stability by 5.24%, while GAN increased reproducibility by 8% it reduced stability by 4.33%. Classification analysis revealed that ComBat increased average AUC by 15.19%, whereas GAN decreased AUC by 2.56%. While GAN qualitatively enhances image harmonization, ComBat provides superior statistical improvements in feature stability and classification performance, highlighting the importance of robust feature-level harmonization in radiomics.",,,

The newly developed PREVENT equations offers several advantages for short and long-term cardiovascular risk prediction. To determine how often PREVENT equations identify increased cardiovascular risk among young adults who experience premature myocardial infarction compared with existing risk calculators. The YOUNG-MI registry is a retrospective cohort from two large academic centers, which included individuals who experienced an MI at age ≤ 50 years. Study physicians adjudicated diagnosis of Type 1 MI. Cardiovascular risk was estimated by pooled cohort equations and PREVENT equations based on data available prior to MI or at the time of presentation. The study cohort included 1149 individuals with a median age of 45 years and 19 % women. The median 10-year ASCVD risk calculated by pooled cohort equations and 2023 PREVENT equations was 4.6 % and 2.3 %, respectively. Using the 10-year ASCVD risk estimates from the 2023 PREVENT equations, only 33 (3 %) individuals met the 7.5 % threshold while 93 (8 %) met the 5 % threshold and 333 (29 %) met the 3 % threshold. For 30-year ASCVD risk using PREVENT, 827 (72 %) met a threshold of ≥ 10 %. The PREVENT equations may lead to undertreatment of young adults who experienced an MI.

However, lineage tracing studies have failed to delineate any role of EMT during metastasis. Research is also focused on polyploid giant cancer cells (PGCCs) in solid tumors which appear in response to oncotherapy-related stress for their role in metastasis. But how to explain PGCCs role in metastatic tumors in treatment-naïve patients? Studies done using mouse models and clinical samples suggest that cancer initiates due to dysfunctions of tissue-resident, pluripotent very small embryonic-like stem cells (VSELs). VSELs are the most primitive and pluripotent stem cells that exist at top of cellular hierarchy in multiple tissues. They are normally quiescent and undergo asymmetrical cell divisions to give rise to two cells of different sizes and fates including smaller cells to self-renew and bigger tissue-specific progenitors. Progenitors undergo symmetrical cell divisions and clonal expansion (rapid proliferation, endoduplication with incomplete cytokinesis) to form giant cells that further breakdown and differentiate into tissue-specific cell types. Oncotherapy destroys actively dividing cells, but CSCs survive. We hypothesize that excessive self-renewal and clonal expansion of cancer stem cells (CSCs, dysfunctional VSELs) result in multinucleated giant cells (PGCCs) that accumulate as further differentiation into tissue-specific cell types is blocked in cancerous conditions. PGCCS are being reported by multiple groups whereas CSCs remain elusive due to small size and low abundance and actually contribute to both cancer initiation and metastasis.",Bhartiya D; Sharma N; Tripathi A; Tripathi A,Epigeneres Biotech Pvt Ltd,deepa.bhartiya@epigeneres.com.

While a multi-faceted problem, this deceleration may be influenced by the preferred model systems utilized in translation research. Cardiac cell lines, although easier to handle, lack biological accuracy due to the unnatural modifications required for successful culture and may not recapitulate complex 3-dimensional structural and environmental factors. At the same time, whole animal experimentation provides unwanted complexity during initial scientific development. Alternatively, ex vivo perfusion of isolated rodent hearts provides the needed biological accuracy with decreased organismal complexity. This platform facilitates the evaluation of the isolated heart, without neuro-reflexes and/or humoral contributions, unveiling the direct effects of stimuli in heart function/homeostasis. This manuscript leverages the wide array of perfusion parameters (i.e. perfusate, flow rate, coronary pressures), to demonstrate the capability of ex vivo heart perfusion protocols to accommodate a large range of experimental needs. Through this work, it was determined that the use of physiological perfusion pressures leads to increased left ventricular (LV) pressures but results in a loss of function over time, making it ideal conditions for organ assessment. Conversely, lower-than-physiological perfusion pressures lead to decreased LV pressures but prevent loss of function over time, which is preferable when longer perfusion times are relevant to experimental needs. Similarly, the use of adenosine as a pharmacological intervention was found to decrease both edema formation and inflammatory responses. In contrast, the use of packed red blood cells as oxygen carriers appears to induce a pro-inflammatory response and cause greater cardiac damage, particularly when combined with low perfusion pressures.",,,sntessier@mgh.harvard.edu.

Current treatments, such as vancomycin, are effective but can cause subsequent relapses, further microbiota disruption, and high treatment costs. Probiotics offer a promising microbiota-based therapeutic strategy. Following an in vitro screening for novel lactic acid bacterial (LAB) strains with strong anti-C. difficile ability and good tolerance to digestive challenges, Lactiplantibacillus plantarum GMNL-661 emerged as a potential solution to combat CDI. In a CDI mice model, the appropriate dose of GMNL-661 effectively alleviated CDI, which caused weight loss, gut inflammation, and mucin depletion. GMNL-661 alleviated CDI symptoms through increased gut barrier genes and downregulated IL-1 and IL-18. 16s rDNA analysis of mice stool from CDI and CDI supplemented with GMNL-661 showed distinct microbiota ecology. GMNL-661 dramatically affected the microbiome of CDI, increasing Lactobacillus spp. and Clostridium cluster XVIII while reducing Clostridium and Enterococcus species. Genome analysis of GMNL-661 revealed minimal safety concerns in antibiotic resistance and virulence genes, confirming that it is suitable for inclusion in the food chain.

Rheumatology,10.1016/S2665-9913(25)00022-0,"In the TULIP-1 and TULIP-2 phase 3 trials, anifrolumab treatment was associated with clinical efficacy and clinically meaningful improvements in multiple patient-reported outcomes over 52 weeks in patients with moderate-to-severe systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). At the end of TULIP-1 and TULIP-2 (week 52), eligible patients could reconsent to enter a 3-year long-term extension trial (TULIP-LTE). Here, we investigated changes in patient-reported outcomes during treatment with anifrolumab or placebo for up to 4 years in patients with SLE who were receiving standard therapy. TULIP-LTE was a 3-year randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 long-term extension of the 1-year TULIP-1 and TULIP-2 trials. Patients who were randomly assigned to receive anifrolumab 300 mg (n=257) or placebo (n=112) every 4 weeks in the TULIP-1 and TULIP-2 trials and who continued the same treatment in TULIP-LTE were assessed. Exploratory endpoints were changes from baseline in patient-reported outcomes (Short Form-36 version 2 acute recall [SF-36v2 (acute)], Patient Global Assessment of disease activity, EuroQoL 5 Dimensions-5 Levels [EQ-5D-5L], and Work Productivity and Activity Impairment-Lupus) and health utility indices, Short-Form 6-Dimension (SF-6D), derived from SF-36v2 (acute), and EQ-5D-5L. All analyses were done in the modified intention-to-treat population, which included all randomly assigned patients from TULIP-1 and TULIP-2 who received at least one dose of the same treatment during the long-term extension phase. Least-squares mean patient-reported outcome scores were adjusted using a repeated measures model. No people with lived experience were directly involved in the study design or implementation. This trial was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02794285. Between June 30, 2016, and Oct 12, 2018, 369 patients entered the long-term extension study and were included in this exploratory analysis (257 in the anifrolumab group and 112 in the placebo group). Mean age of patients was 42·8 years (SD 11·5), 340 (92%) of 369 patients were women and 29 (8%) were men, 250 (68%) patients were White and 82 (22%) self-identified as Hispanic or Latino. Patient-reported outcome scores improved from baseline in both groups during the 4-year treatment period. At week 208, improvement from baseline in SF-36v2 (acute) was numerically higher in the anifrolumab group than the placebo group for the bodily pain domain (least-squares mean difference 5·9 [95% CI -0·7 to 12·5]) and the mental health domain (3·7 [-1·2 to 8·6]). Improvements from baseline in SF-6D were generally greater in the anifrolumab group than the placebo group, with numerical differences between groups evident from as early as week 24 (least-squares mean difference 0·013 [-0·007 to 0·032]) and maintained at week 208 (0·016 [-0·010 to 0·042]). Over 4 years of treatment, patients reported improvements in health status and health-related quality of life, including differences favouring anifrolumab compared with placebo. These numerical improvements in patient-reported outcomes occurred alongside improvements in disease activity, reduced glucocorticoid doses, and a tolerable safety profile.

HCC cells frequently undergo macroautophagy, also known as autophagy, which can lead to tumor progression and chemotherapy resistance. Annexin A2 (ANXA2) has been identified as a potential therapeutic target in HCC and is involved in the regulation of autophagic process. Here, we for the first time showed that ANXA2 deacetylation plays a crucial role in donafenib-induced autophagy. Mechanistically, donafenib increased SIRT2 activity via triggering both SIRT2 dephosphorylation and deacetylation by respectively downregulating cyclin E/CDK and p300. Moreover, elevation of SIRT2 activity by donafenib caused ANXA2 deacetylation at K81/K206 sites, leading to a reduction of the binding between ANXA2 and mTOR, which resulted in a decrease of mTOR phosphorylation and activity, and ultimately promoted protective autophagy and donafenib insensitivity in HCC cells. Additionally, ANXA2 deacetylation at K81/K206 sites was positively correlated with poor prognosis in HCC patients. Meanwhile, we found that selective inhibition of SIRT2 increased the sensitivity of donafenib in HCC cells by strengthening ANXA2 acetylation. In summary, this study reveals that donafenib induces protective autophagy and decreases its sensitivity in HCC cells through enhancing SIRT2-mediated ANXA2 deacetylation, which suggest that targeting ANXA2 acetylation/deacetylation may be a promising strategy for improving the sensitivity of donafenib in HCC treatment.",,,haoyingxue@hotmail.com.

This study aims to assess measles population immunity levels in China and investigate factors contributing to age-specific heterogeneities. We conducted a cross-sectional population-based serological study in southern China between June and October 2021. We determined the population mean antibody concentration and seroprevalence by age and over time, along with their associated determinants. Moreover, we estimated the contact-adjusted immunity levels by considering both age-specific immunity levels and population contact rates. Among the 1015 study participants (aged 0-95 years), the overall seroprevalence was estimated at 80.9% (95% confidence interval [CI], 78.3-83.3). When adjusting for the age-specific contact rates, the contact-adjusted immunity was estimated at 66.8% (95% CI, 56.6-75.1). Individuals younger than age 30 years showed significantly lower antibody concentration and seroprevalence (mean log concentration: 5.9, seroprevalence: 73.6% [95% CI, 69.9-77.3]) compared to those older than age 50 years (mean log concentration: 6.8, seroprevalence: 96.8% [95% CI, 94.7-98.9]). In particular, individuals born after the last SIA (2010) showed a significantly faster waning of immunity. Our findings highlight that immunity levels in the general population remain below the 95% threshold, underscoring the need for continued monitoring of immunity dynamics, especially for individuals born in a near-elimination setting and without subsequent SIAs.",,,

SLC16A family members play important roles in tumorigenesis, nonetheless, the specific involvement of SLC16A3 in tumor prognosis and diagnosis in human cancers remains unelucidated. This study dealt with the exploration of SLC16A3 expression in human pan-cancer and its significance regarding disease prognosis. For this investigation, the mRNA expression data of SLC16A3 were acquired from the TCGA and the GTEx datasets. The Kaplan-Meier plots, univariate Cox regression, and the ROC curve were employed for assessing the prognostic and diagnostic significance of SLC16A3 in pan-cancer. Furthermore, the cBioPortal database was used to analyze the SLC16A3 genomic alterations. Moreover, the association of the infiltration of immune cells and immune checkpoint genes with SLC16A3 was analyzed by the TIMER database. Gene Ontology and KEGG pathway analysis were employed to explore the function of SLC16A3 in pan-cancer. The resulting data demonstrated that SLC16A3 mRNA expression was overexpressed in most cancers and its protein expression was also high across diverse cancer types. Moreover, upregulated SLC16A3 expression was linked to poor OS and PFI of certain cancers. Cox regression analysis further indicated that SLC16A3 is a risk factor for patients with PAAD, CESC, LUSC, LUAD, CHOL, LGG, MESO, and OSCC. The ROC curve revealed that SLC16A3 exhibited a high accuracy (AUC > 0.9) in BRCA, CHOL, ESCA, GBM, and KIRC prediction. Moreover, the acquired data indicated that in pan-cancer, the SLC16A3 expression exhibited correlations with immune checkpoint genes and immune cells.

First line therapies for localized GA include topical and intralesional corticosteroids. Systemic corticosteroids have been used for generalized; however, rates of partial and complete resolution are disappointing. Recent advances in understanding the pathophysiology of macrophage activation and granuloma formation have led to Janus Kinase (JAK) inhibition as a therapeutic target for GA. The objectives of our study were to provide insight into the pathophysiology of GA and describe the clinical course and findings in patients with GA on JAK inhibitor therapy. This is a retrospective case series of 9 adults (age ≥ 18 years) with a diagnosis of GA and concomitant use of an oral JAK inhibitor. All patients on oral JAK inhibitor therapy (upadacitinib or abrocitinib) had improvement and/or clearance of their GA lesions within the first three months of therapy. Few adverse events commonly implicated in JAK inhibitor therapy (e.g., URI symptoms, malaise, acne) were reported. This study is limited by small sample size. JAK inhibitor therapy can be used in patients with GA, especially if they failed other treatments. Furthermore, JAK inhibitor therapy resulted in faster clearance time compared to other conventional treatments (e.g., antimicrobials, antimalarials, apremilast, methotrexate, and anti-tumor necrosis factor inhibitors). Depending on extent of GA involvement and patient-provider preferences, oral JAK inhibition therapy can be used off-label.

Severe RIL has been associated with worse prognosis and survival, and recent studies suggested that RIL also affects immunotherapy efficacy. We aimed to develop murine grade 2 (≥20 % decrease in absolute lymphocyte counts (ALC)) RIL models and to examine the effects of RIL on progression-free survival upon radiotherapy-immunotherapy treatment. C57BL6/J mice received heart, large blood vessels (LBV) or thoracic vertebrae irradiation (10 Gy) and ALC were monitored weekly. In tumour-bearing animals, Lewis Lung Carcinoma cells were injected subcutaneously one day prior to RIL induction. When tumours reached 212 ± 45 mm Radiation treatment plans targeting lymphocyte-rich organs were optimized to achieve maximal target coverage while minimal dose to normal tissues. In naïve animals, LBV and vertebrae irradiation led to grade 2 RIL, however heart irradiation induced only grade 1 RIL. In tumour-bearing animals, RIL induction was confirmed by a 16 % and 20 % drop in ALC upon LBV and vertebrae irradiation, respectively. Grade 2 RIL did not negatively influence progression-free survival upon radiotherapy. Radiation combined with L19-IL2 induced a tumour growth delay compared to radiotherapy only (p < 0.0005). LBV or vertebrae irradiation did not affect radiotherapy-immunotherapy outcome, explained by the restored and increased lymphocyte and eosinophil counts upon L19-IL2 administration (p < 0.05).

Most of LFT devices were based on nitrocellulose membrane strips whose industrial upscaling to billions of devices has already been extensively demonstrated. Nevertheless, the assay option in an LFT format is largely restricted to qualitative detection of the target antigens. In this research, we surveyed the potential of UV nanoimprint lithography (UV-NIL) and extrusion coating (EC) for the high-throughput production of disposable capillary-driven, foil-based tests that allow multistep assays to be implemented for quantitative readout to address the inherent lack of on-demand fluid control and sensitivity of paper-based devices. Both manufacturing technologies operate on the principle of imprinting that enables high-volume, continuous structuring of microfluidic patterns in a roll-to-roll (R2R) production scheme. To demonstrate the feasibility of R2R-fabricated foil chips in a point-of-care biosensing application, we adapted a commercial chemiluminescence multiplex test for COVID-19 antibody detection originally developed for a capillary-driven microfluidic chip manufactured with injection molding (IM). In an effort to build a complete ecosystem for the R2R manufacturing of foil chips, we also recruited additional processes to streamline chip production: R2R biofunctionalization and R2R lamination. Compared to conventional fabrication techniques for microfluidic devices, the R2R techniques highlighted in this work offer unparalleled advantages concerning improved scalability, dexterity of seamless handling, and significant cost reduction. Our preliminary evaluation indicated that the foil chips exhibited comparable performance characteristics to the original IM-fabricated devices. This early success in assay translation highlights the promise of implementing biochemical assays on R2R-manufactured foil chips.

We received 830 responses from 17 countries, with an overall response rate of 29%. Most respondents were specialists working in mixed ICUs. Feeding intolerance was assessed by 90% of respondents in their clinical work, though only 36% considered it well defined. Gastric residual volume and vomiting were symptoms most frequently used for defining feeding intolerance. Metoclopramide was the preferred prokinetic agent (54% of respondents), followed by erythromycin (42%). Four out of five considered using combination therapy, primarily a combination of metoclopramide and erythromycin (89%). Concerns about side effects were reported for all agents, with extrapyramidal symptoms and QT prolongation being the most common across agents. The majority (91%) of respondents supported a future randomised trial comparing prokinetic agents to placebo. This international survey found practice variations in the symptoms reportedly used to assess feeding intolerance. Metoclopramide was the preferred prokinetic agent, followed by erythromycin. Most respondents supported a future randomised trial.",Alhazzani W; Wall O; McGrath C,Health Research Centre; Department of Critical Care; Department of Anaesthesiology and Intensive Care,

Oncolytic herpes virus (oHSV) initiates direct tumor debulking by tumor lysis and activates anti-tumor immunity, however, little is known about the role of glioma metabolism in determining oHSV efficacy. Here we identify that oHSV rewires central carbon metabolism increasing glucose utilization towards oxidative phosphorylation and shuttling glutamine towards reductive carboxylation in IDH wildtype glioma. The switch in metabolism results in increased lipid synthesis and cellular ROS. PKC induces ACSL4 in oHSV treated cells leading to lipid peroxidation and ferroptosis. Ferroptosis is critical to launch an anti-tumor immune response which is important for viral efficacy. Mutant IDH (IDHR132H) gliomas are incapable of reductive carboxylation and hence ferroptosis. Pharmacological blockade of IDHR132H induces ferroptosis and anti-tumor immunity. This study provides a rationale to use an IDHR132H inhibitor to treat high grade IDH-mutant glioma patients undergoing oHSV treatment.",,,usahu@augusta.edu.
40267018,Development of Recombinant Follicle-Stimulating Hormone for the Superovulation of Cattle: A Review.,,Veterinary sciences,10.3390/vetsci12030264,"Embryo transfer technology is extensively utilized in cattle breeding, with superovulation serving as its foundation. Superovulation currently relies on the administration of exogenous hormones to stimulate follicular development and maturation in the ovaries, with porcine pituitary-derived follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) being the most commonly used. However, pituitary-derived FSH requires multiple injections, contains luteinizing hormone (LH) and other proteins, and carries a risk of disease transmission. The development of recombinant FSH proteins through protein recombinant technology represents a significant research direction for addressing the aforementioned challenges. Over the past 30 years, extensive studies have been conducted on the development of recombinant bovine, ovine, or porcine FSH. Nevertheless, to date, no commercially recombinant FSH has been widely applied in the superovulation of cattle. This review provides an overview of the molecular design, selection of expression systems, and biological activity of recombinant bovine, ovine, or porcine FSH. This review also summarizes the results of utilizing recombinant FSH in superovulation protocols for cattle. The utilization of recombinant proteins as an alternative to traditionally extracted products in livestock production represents an irreversible trend. The livestock industry is highly sensitive to costs; therefore, it is essential to develop high-quality and cost-effective recombinant FSH products through appropriate molecular design and the use of suitable expression systems.",,,
40266427,TM9SF4 is a potential prognostic biomarker in hepatocellular carcinoma.,,Discover oncology,10.1007/s12672-025-02417-2,"The transmembrane 9 superfamily protein member 4 (TM9SF4) is a transmembrane protein upregulated in multiple cancers; however, its role in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains unknown. The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) and International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC) databases were utilized to investigate the differential expression of TM9SF4 in HCC and tumor tissues. The prognostic and value of TM9SF4 in HCC was evaluated using Kaplan-Meier analysis, Cox regression, and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analyses. The expression pattern and prognostic value of TM9SF4 was further verified using immunohistochemical (IHC) examination of 87 pairs of HCC clinical specimens. A nomogram was constructed by combining TM9SF4 expression and clinicopathological parameters to predict prognosis for individual patient. Additionally, gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was performed to identify key pathways related to TM9SF4. TM9SF4 expression was upregulated in the HCC tissues. High expression of TM9SF4 was significantly associated with advanced T stage, histological grade, and worse survival. Multivariable Cox analysis revealed that TM9SF4 expression was an independent factor for overall survival. The nomogram by incorporating the TM9SF4 and T stage showed good performance in predicting prognosis. Moreover, GSEA analysis revealed that TM9SF4 was functionally involved in pathways associated with the cell cycle. These findings suggest that TM9SF4 is a promising biomarker with prognostic potential and functional significance in HCC.",,,13918911864@163.com.

Currently, many manufacturers are developing bivalent, trivalent, and tetravalent vaccines that target these antigens. Cell-based neutralization assay (CBNA), the gold standard for detecting neutralizing antibodies (NtAbs), which are used as indicators of HFMD vaccine efficacy, has several limitations. We aimed to develop a novel assay for detecting NtAbs against a quadrivalent HFMD vaccine. We developed a four-color pseudovirus-based neutralization assay (PBNA), utilizing fluorescent reporter genes, to rapidly evaluate neutralizing antibodies against EV71, CA16, CA10, and CA6 in multivalent vaccines and compared it with CBNA. PBNA could rapidly and simultaneously detect NtAbs against the four serotypes and required lesser amounts of sera compared to CBNA. A good consistency in determining NtAb titers was observed for PBNA and CBNA.

This Phase IV, open-label, parallel-controlled observational study, required by China's National Medical Products Administration (NMPA), involves 6.5-year-old children who received four doses of sIPV or Salk IPV (wIPV) at 2, 3, 4, and 18 months during the Phase III trial. Participants are recruited in a 2:1 ratio and contribute blood samples for polio-neutralizing antibody (nAb) assays to determine non-inferiority of immune persistence. The study enrolled 483 participants aged 6.5 years in the 5-year Immune Persistence Set (IPS2), with 318 in the sIPV group and 165 in the wIPV group. Additionally, 387 participants (255 sIPV, 132 wIPV) with samples at six-time points were included in the Full Sequence Immune Persistence Set (IPS3). In IPS2, seropositivity rates (SPRs) for nAbs against serotypes 1-3 were over 99% in sIPV and 98% in wIPV. At 6.5 years, geometric mean titers (GMTs) were significantly higher in the sIPV group 543.96, 179.59 and 362.72 compared to the wIPV group 190.75, 81.05 and 203.95 for serotypes 1, 2 and 3, respectively. Participants in IPS3 demonstrated comparable SPRs and GMTs to IPS2, with values of 566.01 vs. 187.41 for serotype I, 177.55 vs. 78.01 for serotype II, and 365.47 vs. 190.31 for serotype III in the sIPV and wIPV groups, respectively.

Proteins are widely recognized as biomarkers for various diseases, but they present a unique challenge due to their vast diversity and concentration range in biological samples. Here, inspired by the nuclear pore complex, we incorporated a layer of disordered polypeptides into the biological nanopore YaxAB. This polypeptide mesh formed an entropic gate, significantly reducing the entry of proteins from a highly concentrated mixture, including blood. The introduction of a specific recognition element within the disordered polypeptides allowed targeted proteins to penetrate through the nanopores, where they were recognized by specific current signatures. This biosensing approach allowed for the recognition of nanomolar proteins directly from blood samples without prior sample preparation. This work paves the way for the next generation of nanopore sensors for the real-time detection of proteins in blood.",,,

Neurology,10.1016/S1474-4422(25)00068-7,"There remains a substantial unmet need for effective and safe treatments for neuropathic pain. The Neuropathic Pain Special Interest Group aimed to update treatment recommendations, published in 2015, on the basis of new evidence from randomised controlled trials, emerging neuromodulation techniques, and advances in evidence synthesis. For this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched Embase, PubMed, the International Clinical Trials Registry, and ClinicalTrials.gov from data inception for neuromodulation trials and from Jan 1, 2013, for pharmacological interventions until Feb 12, 2024. We included double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trials that evaluated pharmacological and neuromodulation treatments administered for at least 3 weeks, or if there was at least 3 weeks of follow-up, and which included at least ten participants per group. Trials included participants of any age with neuropathic pain, defined by the International Association for the Study of Pain. We excluded trials with enriched enrolment randomised withdrawal designs and those with participants with mixed aetiologies (ie, neuropathic and non-neuropathic pain) and conditions such as complex regional pain syndrome, low back pain without radicular pain, fibromyalgia, and idiopathic orofacial pain. We extracted summary data in duplicate from published reports, with discrepancies reconciled by a third independent reviewer on the platform Covidence. The primary efficacy outcome was the proportion of responders (50% or 30% reduction in baseline pain intensity or moderate pain relief). The primary safety outcome was the number of participants who withdrew from the treatment owing to adverse events. We calculated a risk difference for each comparison and did a random-effects meta-analysis. Risk differences were used to calculate the number needed to treat (NNT) and the number needed to harm (NNH) for each treatment. Risk of bias was assessed by use of the Cochrane risk of bias tool 2 and certainty of evidence assessed by use of GRADE. Recommendations were based on evidence of efficacy, adverse events, accessibility, and cost, and feedback from engaged lived experience partners. This study is registered on PROSPERO, CRD42023389375. We identified 313 trials (284 pharmacological and 29 neuromodulation studies) for inclusion in the meta-analysis. Across all studies, 48 789 adult participants were randomly assigned to trial groups (20 611 female and 25 078 male participants, where sex was reported). Estimates for the primary efficacy and safety outcomes were tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) NNT=4·6 (95% CI 3·2-7·7), NNH=17·1 (11·4-33·6; moderate certainty of evidence), α2δ-ligands NNT=8·9 (7·4-11·10), NNH=26·2 (20·4-36·5; moderate certainty of evidence), serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) NNT=7·4 (5·6-10·9), NNH=13·9 (10·9-19·0; moderate certainty of evidence), botulinum toxin (BTX-A) NNT=2·7 (1·8-9·61), NNH=216·3 (23·5-∞; moderate certainty of evidence), capsaicin 8% patches NNT=13·2 (7·6-50·8), NNH=1129·3 (135·7-∞; moderate certainty of evidence), opioids NNT=5·9 (4·1-10·7), NNH=15·4 (10·8-24·0; low certainty of evidence), repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) NNT=4·2 (2·3-28·3), NNH=651·6 (34·7-∞; low certainty of evidence), capsaicin cream NNT=6·1 (3·1-∞), NNH=18·6 (10·6-77·1; very low certainty of evidence), lidocaine 5% plasters NNT=14·5 (7·8-108·2), NNH=178·0 (23·9-∞; very low certainty of evidence). The findings provided the basis for a strong recommendation for use of TCAs, α2δ-ligands, and SNRIs as first-line treatments; a weak recommendation for capsaicin 8% patches, capsaicin cream, and lidocaine 5% plasters as second-line recommendation; and a weak recommendation for BTX-A, rTMS, and opioids as third-line treatments for neuropathic pain. Our results support a revision of the Neuropathic Pain Special Interest Group recommendations for the treatment of neuropathic pain.

The prevailing dogma posits that invasive local recurrence is the source of subsequent metastasis, and thus the goal of DCIS therapy is the prevention of local recurrence. Recently, this paradigm has been called into question by the observation that some women develop metastatic disease in the absence of local recurrence or even following bilateral mastectomies, suggesting early cancer dissemination in some patients. If the presence of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) can be verified on some patients with pure DCIS, then dissemination may be occurring earlier than previously thought, suggesting that these patients might require additional monitoring or treatment. Here, we present a workflow to isolate and characterize CTCs from DCIS patients. Using a high throughput size based inertial focusing microfluidic device, the Labyrinth, we isolated and identified CTCs in 66.6 % (12/18) of DCIS patients with an average of 1.337 CTCs per five mL. Immunofluorescence staining and single cell qPCR of CTCs reveal mesenchymal characteristics of the cells that may contribute to their ability to migrate and metastasize. Preliminary targeted DNA sequencing revealed single nucleotide variations previously found in DCIS samples. Overall, this data supports the hypothesis that cancer dissemination is occurring in a subset of DCIS patients earlier than previously thought. Additionally, the molecular characterization of CTC in DCIS patients may provide important information on their biological characteristics and associated clinical behavior.",,,mwicha@med.umich.edu.

We investigated whether ctDNA measurements could predict survival outcomes during adjuvant targeted therapy or placebo treatment in stage III melanoma, thereby identifying patients at high risk and low risk of recurrence. Analytically validated mutation-specific droplet digital PCR assays were used to measure BRAF Baseline plasma samples were available for 597 of 870 patients (331 male patients and 266 female patients) and samples for assessing the ctDNA positivity rate at landmark follow-up timepoints of 3 months, 6 months, 9 months, and 12 months after treatment initiation were available for 94 of 870 patients. Additionally, samples were available from 118 of 870 patients within a 2-month timeframe before or after clinical or radiographic recurrence. Median follow-up for the biomarker analyses was 60 months (IQR 39-66) in the combination therapy group and 58 months (21-66) for the placebo group. ctDNA was detectable in 79 (13%) of 597 baseline samples. ctDNA positivity rate and mutant copies per mL plasma were significantly higher in patients with higher disease substages. As a binary variable, ctDNA detection was associated with worse recurrence-free survival (placebo group: median 3·71 months [95% CI 2·39-6·89] vs 24·41 months [17·28-43·13]; hazard ratio [HR] 2·91 [95% CI 1·99-4·25], p<0·0001); combination therapy group: median 16·59 months [95% CI 12·02-26·80] vs 68·11 months [50·36-not reached]; HR 2·98 [1·95-4·54], p<0·0001) and overall survival (placebo group: median 33·90 months [13·96-not reached] vs not reached; HR 3·35 [2·01-5·55], p<0·0001); combination therapy group: median 40·31 months [24·90-not reached] vs not reached; HR 4·27 [2·50-7·27], p<0·0001) in the placebo group and combination therapy groups. Baseline ctDNA was more strongly associated with survival outcomes than IFNG gene expression or tumour mutational burden.

Central to its pathogenesis is the dysregulation of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway, which drives fibroblast activation, epithelial-mesenchymal transition, apoptosis resistance, and cellular senescence. Senescent cells contribute to fibrosis through the secretion of pro-inflammatory and profibrotic factors in the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). Current antifibrotic therapies, Nintedanib and Pirfenidone, only slow disease progression and are limited by side effects, highlighting the need for novel treatments. This review focuses on the role of PI3K/Akt signaling in IPF pathogenesis, its intersection with inflammation and fibrosis, and emerging therapeutic approaches targeting molecules along this pathway.",,,

IMscin002 (NCT05171777), a phase 2, randomized, open-label, crossover trial, investigated patient preferences and health care professionals' (HCPs') perceptions of atezolizumab SC versus IV for the treatment of NSCLC; we report the primary results of IMscin002. Patients with programmed death-ligand 1-positive resected NSCLC who had completed adjuvant chemotherapy without evidence of recurrence, and chemotherapy-naive patients with programmed death-ligand 1-high metastatic NSCLC were randomized 1:1 to arm A (atezolizumab SC then atezolizumab IV) or arm B (atezolizumab IV then atezolizumab SC). After cycle 3, patients switched administration routes. After cycle 6, the patients chose the route of administration for the continuation period. The primary end point was patient preference for SC or IV atezolizumab, and the secondary end points were patient- and HCP-reported outcomes and safety. A total of 179 patients were included in this study. Most patients (70.7%; n = 87 of 123) preferred SC atezolizumab over IV, with 79.4% (n = 85 of 107) choosing SC atezolizumab during the continuation period. Among the HCPs, 75.2% (n = 76 of 101) indicated that atezolizumab SC was more convenient than IV, and 77.8% (n = 77 of 99) strongly agreed or agreed that it would allow patients to spend less time in care units. No new or unexpected safety findings were identified, and switching between administration routes was well tolerated and managed. Most patients preferred SC atezolizumab over IV.

Oncolytic virotherapy has emerged as a promising therapeutic for other NETs and thus, we sought to investigate the potential of an engineered oncolytic herpes simplex virus (oHSV), M002, for GEP-NETS. We employed an established long-term passage GEP-NET cell line and a unique, human pediatric patient-derived xenograft GEP-NET line. We found the virus to effectively infect, replicate within, and kill both cell lines in vitro. Similar effects were noted in vivo, with M002 decreasing tumor growth and improving overall survival in mice bearing tumors from both the established cell line and human GEP-NET PDX. Overall, these studies provide an evaluation of an oncolytic HSV in GEP-NETs, highlighting its therapeutic potential and considerations for clinical translation.",,,elizabeth.beierle@childrensal.org.

However, the biology of DNTs is less well characterized, and how DNT therapy distinguishes from conventional γδ T-cell therapy remains unclear. Collectively, this hinders our ability to bolster DNT functionalities in cancer therapy. Here, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing with in vitro and in vivo functional analysis on DNTs. As a significant proportion of DNTs express Vγ9Vδ2 (Vδ2) TCR chain, we compared DNTs with donor-matched conventional Vδ2 T cells expanded with zoledronic acid. Healthy donor-derived allogeneic DNTs and Vδ2 T cells were expanded ex vivo. Single-cell RNA sequencing analysis was performed on both cellular products to identify the transcriptional landscape and inferred cellular interactions within DNTs, followed by comparisons with donor-matched Vδ2 T cells. Unique cellular subsets found only in DNTs were depleted to identify their contributions to the overall efficacy of DNTs against acute myeloid leukemia. The anti-leukemic activity and in vivo persistence of DNTs and Vδ2 T-cells were explored using flow cytometry-based cytotoxicity assays, memory phenotyping, and xenograft models. Despite a shared Vδ2 expression between cellular products, we identified unique cellular compositions in DNTs that contribute to distinct transcriptional and cellular communication patterns relative to the donor-matched Vδ2 T cells, including higher expression of genes identified in chimeric antigen receptor T cells that persist in patients with durable cancer-remission. Vδ2 These results highlight the unique transcriptional, cellular, and functional profile of human DNTs and support the continued clinical investigation of allogeneic DNT therapy. The data also provide a reference gene signature that may help improve the efficacy of other types of allogeneic adoptive cellular therapies.",,,li.zhang@uhnresearch.ca.

Novel immunotherapeutic strategies for this patient population are urgently needed. We tested a novel, fully human anti-CD22/4-1BB CAR T-cell construct, CART22-65s, in parallel phase I studies for pediatric and adult B-ALL. After lymphodepletion, CART22-65s was infused using a 3-day fractionated dosing scheme, allowing for omission of the second and third doses in cases of early cytokine release syndrome (CRS). Twenty-two patients, all with relapse after prior CD19-directed immunotherapy, were enrolled. Of 19 infused patients (pediatric, n=17; adult, n=2), 14 (74%) achieved a complete remission (CR), including 4 of 6 (67%) patients refractory to prior inotuzumab. Five of 14 patients in a CR proceeded to consolidative hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). With a median follow-up of 38 months, the 12-month relapse-free survival rate was 38.4% (95% CI 19.3% to 76.5%) and overall survival rate was 52.6% (95% CI 34.3% to 80.6%). Two patients received additional CART22-65s treatments for subsequent CD22-positive relapses; one achieved another CR. All CRS (n=17, 89%) and neurotoxicity (n=4, 21%) events after initial infusion were grades 1-2. The only grade 3 CRS/neurotoxicity and the only high-grade immune effector cell-associated hemophagocytic lymphohistocytosis-like syndrome occurred in the retreatment setting. In vivo cellular kinetic data revealed robust CART22-65s proliferation by quantitative PCR peaking at a median of 20 days postinfusion, with the cells persisting out to month 42 in one patient who achieved a long-term remission with CART22-65s alone. The favorable safety profile and high remission rates in exceedingly refractory B-ALL support the continued development of CART22-65s but also highlight the need to use the product in combination with HCT or other novel strategies.

40240556,Quantitative MRI detects delayed perfusion and impact of bronchial artery dilatation on pulmonary circulation in patients with cystic fibrosis.,,European radiology,10.1007/s00330-025-11589-y,"MRI detects abnormal lung perfusion in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). However, little is known about the contribution of bronchial arteries to lung perfusion in CF. We hypothesized that delayed perfusion can be detected by dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE-)MRI and that bronchial artery dilatation (BAD) is associated with changes in lung perfusion. Morpho-functional MRI was prospectively acquired in 75 patients with CF (18.7 ± 7.6 years, range 6-39 years). Lungs and perfusion defects were segmented automatically to quantify perfusion defects in percent (QDP). Pulmonary blood flow (PBF), mean transit time (MTT), and perfusion delay were calculated for the whole lung, inside normally perfused and perfusion defect areas. Chest MRI score and BAD were assessed visually. QDP and PBF correlated with MRI global score (r = 0.58 and -0.53, p < 0.001). In normally perfused lung, PBF was higher (161.2 ± 77.9 mL/100 mL/min vs. 57.5 ± 26.4 mL/100 mL/min, p < 0.001), and MTT (5.4 ± 1.7 s vs. 6.9 ± 2.3 s, p < 0.001) and perfusion delay were shorter than in perfusion defect areas (4.6 ± 5.3 s vs. 13.4 ± 16.2 s, p < 0.001). 48 (64.0%) patients showed BAD, had higher QDP (44.6 ± 20.8% vs. 17.3 ± 11.0%, p < 0.001) and lower PBF (91.9 ± 54.8 mL/100 mL/min vs. 178.3 ± 77.4 mL/100 mL/min, p < 0.001) than patients without BAD. MTT was shorter (6.3 ± 1.9 s vs. 8.0 ± 2.6 s, p < 0.001), and perfusion delay was longer (13.8 ± 10.1 s vs. 12.8 ± 23.7 s, p < 0.02) inside perfusion defects of patients with BAD compared to without BAD. Perfusion parameters correlate with lung disease severity, and perfusion defects showed delayed perfusion in patients with CF. BAD was associated with more extensive perfusion defects and reduced PBF. Question Dilated bronchial arteries are a common comorbidity in cystic fibrosis (CF), which can cause hemoptysis, but their quantitative contribution to lung perfusion is little researched. Findings Perfusion defects in percent (QDP) enabled objective assessment of perfusion abnormalities in CF patients, while perfusion delay and arterial correlation showed bronchial artery perfusion contribution. Clinical relevance The usage of quantitative perfusion metrics in CF may help tracking disease progression. By also including the proposed metrics perfusion delay and arterial correlation, bronchial artery inflow could be assessed and used to detect early onset of bronchial artery dilation.",Graeber SY; Stahl M; Mall MA,Department of Pediatric Respiratory Medicine,mark.wielpuetz@med.uni-greifswald.de.

This study created a strategy to assess choroidal thinning through the video analysis of facial skin. Videos capturing the entire facial skin were collected from 48 participants with age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and 12 healthy individuals. These facial videos were analyzed using video-based trans-angiosomes imaging photoplethysmography (TaiPPG) to generate facial imaging biomarkers that were correlated with choroidal thickness (CT) measurements. The CT of all patients was determined using swept-source optical coherence tomography (SS-OCT). The results revealed the relationship between relative blood pulsation amplitude (BPA) in three typical facial angiosomes (cheek, side-forehead, and mid-forehead) and the average macular CT (r=0.48, P<0.001; r=-0.56, P<0.001; r=-0.40, P<0.01). When considering a diagnostic threshold of 200 µm for CT, the newly developed facial video analysis tool effectively distinguished between cases of choroidal thinning and normal cases, yielding areas under the curve of 0.75, 0.79, and 0.69. These findings shed light on the connection between choroidal blood flow and facial skin hemodynamics, which suggests the potential for predicting vascular diseases through widely accessible skin imaging data.",,,

However, comparing biomarker measures without standardization and appreciating their magnitude relative to the disease can be challenging. To address this issue, we propose the CentiMarker approach, similar to Centiloid, which provides a standardized scale between normal (0) and nearly maximum abnormal AD (100) ranges. We applied this scale to cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers in dominantly inherited AD and sporadic AD cohorts. CentiMarkers facilitated the interpretation of disease abnormality, demonstrating comparable changes and distributions of AD biomarkers across disease stages. CentiMarkers make the treatment effect more comparable than their original scales across various biomarkers. The versatility of CentiMarkers makes it a valuable tool for standardized biomarker comparison in AD research, enabling informed cross-study comparisons and contributing to accelerated therapeutic development. Adoption of the CentiMarker scale could enhance biomarker reporting and advance our understanding of AD.

This was shown for antibodies directed against the hCD40 receptor, where cysteine-to-serine exchange mutations caused changes in antibody conformational flexibility. Here we demonstrate that the principles of increasing agonism by restricting antibody conformation through disulfide modification can be translated to the co-stimulatory receptor h4-1BB, another member of the tumour necrosis factor receptor superfamily. Furthermore, we explore structure-guided design of the anti-hCD40 antibody ChiLob7/4 and show that engineering additional disulfides between opposing F(ab') arms can elicit conformational restriction, concomitant with enhanced agonism.

Emerging therapies that stabilize hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha (HIF-1α) show promise in counteracting follicular degradation and supporting hair regrowth. This communication highlights the potential of iron chelators, specifically deferoxamine (DFO) and deferiprone (DFP), to stabilize HIF-1α by reducing iron availability, thereby promoting vascularization, cellular proliferation, and a regenerative environment in the hair follicle niche. Clinical trials with iron chelators demonstrated improvements in hair density, thickness, and elasticity, as well as a reduction in hair loss by up to 66.8% over six months. These findings underscore the therapeutic potential of iron chelators in autoimmune alopecia management. Future research should explore the synergistic use of iron chelators with immune-modulating therapies, positioning them as viable options in the evolving field of alopecia treatment.",Panayi AC; Perozzo FAG,Department of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery; Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery,

However, with the increased availability of newer and more specific biomarkers and molecular techniques, it is timely to revisit the utility of CK7 and CK20 stains under different clinical settings. In the current study, we retrospectively reviewed 612 surgical pathology cases at our institution where CK7 and/or CK20 stains were performed and determined to what degree they contributed to the final diagnosis. In CK7-and-CK20 cases, the stains had a major contribution in 5% of the cases. In CK7-only or CK20-only cases, the percentages of major contribution were 34% and 69% respectively. However, when only cases where CK7/CK20 stains were used to determine tumor site of origin, the contributions become more comparable across all three case types, where CK7/CK20 stains had major contribution in < 10% of cases. Notably, 11% of CK7-and-CK20 cases had no specific or suggestive diagnosis, and 40% of CK7-and-CK20 cases had staining patterns inconsistent with the final diagnosis. Detailed analysis demonstrates that CK7 and CK20 stains, used singly, are most useful in the diagnosis of a limited number of pathologic entities with distinct CK7 or CK20 expression patterns. Our results suggest that the coordinate expression of CK7 and CK20 is generally not helpful in arriving at the final diagnosis. Reducing unnecessary immunohistochemical stains will help mitigate the rising healthcare cost and preserve tissue for molecular testing.",,,jiaoti.huang@duke.edu.

Formulated as a fine stable suspension, 1-155 was delivered intranasally (IN) at 3 mg/kg via IN delivery once daily. It significantly inhibited collagen deposition in the lungs in the bleomycin-challenged mice. Compared to its vehicle control treatment, a significant reduction in a key myofibroblast marker α smooth muscle actin and TG2 was also detected in the 1-155-treated animals. Most importantly, 1-155 treatment significantly improved several key lung function parameters, such as cord compliance, vital capacity, and dynamic compliance, which are comparable to that found for the positive control nintedanib at a much higher dosage of 60 mg/kg twice daily via oral delivery. The 1-155-treated mice showed a trend in improvement of average body weight. For the first time, our study demonstrates the effectiveness of a selective small molecule TG2 inhibitor in reducing pulmonary fibrosis in a pre-clinical model. Importantly, we were able to correlate this effect of 1-155 with the improvement of animal lung function showing the potential of the use of TG2 inhibitors as a therapeutic treatment for fibrotic lung conditions like IPF.",Sriram S,Isterian Biotech,

The primary objective of this study was to provide evidence-based recommendations to policymakers and healthcare organizations to help ensure the successful integration of genetic services into African healthcare systems. To achieve this goal, we conducted a scoping review of peer-reviewed studies published between 2003 and 2023. The studies were sourced from PubMed, Scopus, and Africa-wide information databases. We based their findings on eight relevant research studies conducted between 2016 and 2023, covering a wide range of genetic topics in six African countries, including Cameroon, Kenya, Nigeria, Rwanda, South Africa, and Tanzania. The studies identified several challenges associated with the implementation of genetic services in African healthcare systems. These challenges include a lack of awareness and education about genetic diseases, barriers to genetic testing, resource limitations, ethical dilemmas, and challenges in follow-up and retention. However, the authors also highlighted opportunities and strategies for successful implementation, emphasizing preventive measures through community engagement, advocacy, and supportive networks. Apart from the potential to improve healthcare outcomes, implementing genetic services in Africa presents opportunities and challenges for healthcare and biotech companies. To address gaps in disease awareness, we recommend that healthcare providers should invest in education, collaborate with local institutions, and utilize digital platforms. Furthermore, businesses should explore innovative, cost-effective genetic testing models and create dialog platforms like online forums to positively impact African health care.",,,kkarenke@yahoo.co.uk.

However, uptake of decision aids has been poor, in part because the time required to incorporate these into clinical practice is not well understood. To estimate the time required for a rheumatology clinic to implement a validated decision aid for patients with lupus. Using a cohort of eight implementation sites, study investigators identified the activities required to administer a decision aid. Site coordinators embedded within the clinics timed the duration of each activity. To estimate the effect of viewing the decision aid on the length of the physician-patient interaction, patient visits were timed and the length of visits for patients who viewed the decision aid were compared with visit lengths for three groups of control patients. Estimates of the effect of the decision aid on patient visit lengths ranged from a reduction of 3 min per visit to an increase of 3.88 min per visit, with five out of six estimates suggesting the decision aid is associated with shorter patient visits. Introducing the decision aid to patients took a mean of 4.12 min (median of 2 min). Identifying patients eligible for the decision aid was a weekly or bi-weekly process for most clinics and took an average of 41.43 min. The time required for a rheumatology clinic to implement the decision aid for patients with lupus is low. Our results raise questions about why decision aid take up is low among clinical practices, given the benefits the lupus decision aid offers to patients (reduced decisional conflict and better-informed choice of immunosuppressive medications used for the treatment of lupus kidney disease). More research is needed to identify barriers to decision aid adoption.",,,Jasvinder.md@gmail.com.
40210835,Concordance of BRAF V600E mutation between immunohistochemistry and genomic testing for thyroid cancer.,,International journal of clinical oncology,10.1007/s10147-025-02760-y,"BRAF V600E mutation is a significant therapeutic target for thyroid cancer, including anaplastic thyroid cancer (ATC). Although targeted therapy for this mutation requires genomic testing in Japan, turnaround time (TAT) is often unacceptably long, especially for certain conditions, such as ATC, which is one of the most aggressive cancers. Here, we evaluated concordance between immunohistochemistry (IHC) with a relatively short TAT of a few days and genomic testing in thyroid cancer. Immunohistochemical staining was performed with BRAF (VE1) antibody (Ventana) using the OptiView method on samples already undergoing genomic testing. A pathologist blindly annotated each staining expression with a cut-off of 1% in the cytoplasm. We then calculated the positive percent agreement (PPA), negative percent agreement (NPA), and overall percent agreement (OPA). We identified 62 samples, including 12 of ATC, that underwent genomic testing using different methods: Oncomine Dx Target Test (ODxTT) (n = 32), MEBGEN BRAF 3 Kit (MEBGEN3) (n = 14), FoundationOne CDx (F1CDx) (n = 13), and GenMineTOP (TOP) (n = 1). Annotation results of IHC were positive for 31, negative for 29, and undeterminable for 2 samples due to low tumor content. PPA, NPA, and OPA were 100%, 91.7%, 96.9% for ODxTT; 100%, 100%, 100% for MEBGEN3; 100%, 80.0%, 93.9% for F1CDx; and incalculable, 100%, 100% for TOP, respectively. Discordance was found in the two undeterminable samples only. Concordance between IHC and genomic testing in assessing BRAF V600E was encouragingly high; its reliability and potentially short TAT should benefit patients, especially those with ATC.",,,ssakashi@east.ncc.go.jp.

Digital health,10.1016/j.landig.2025.02.001,"Several COVID-19 vaccines have been licensed. To support the assessment of safety signals, we developed a toolkit to support COVID-19 vaccine monitoring and benefit-risk assessment. We aim to show the application of our toolkit in the EU using thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS) associated with the Vaxzevria (AstraZeneca) vaccine as a use case. In this population-based study, we used a model incorporating data from multiple EU sources such as The European Surveillance System and EudraVigilance, and estimated the benefits of COVID-19 vaccines by comparing the observed COVID-19 confirmed cases, hospitalisations, intensive care unit (ICU) admissions, and deaths across Europe to the expected numbers in the absence of Vaxzevria vaccination. Risks of TTS associated with Vaxzevria were calculated by comparing the observed number of TTS events in individuals who received Vaxzevria to the expected number of events based on background incidence rates. To visualise the results, we developed a toolkit with an interactive web application. 62 598 505 Vaxzevria vaccines (32 763 183 to females and 29 835 322 to males) had been administered in Europe by Feb 10, 2021. Our results showed that a first dose of Vaxzevria provided benefits across all age groups. Based on vaccine effectiveness estimates and reported coverage in Europe, from Dec 13, 2020 to Dec 31, 2021, vaccination with Vaxzevria was estimated to prevent (per 100 000 doses) 12 113 COVID-19 cases, 1140 hospitalisations, 184 ICU admissions, and 261 deaths. Women aged 30-59 years and males aged 20-29 years had the highest frequency of TTS events. The benefits of vaccination outweighed the risks of TTS in all age groups, with the highest benefits and risks observed in individuals aged 60-69 years. Our toolkit and underlying model contextualised the risk of TTS associated with Vaxzevria relative to its benefits. The methodology employed could be applied to other serious adverse events related to COVID-19 or other vaccines. The adaptability and versatility of such toolkits might contribute to strengthening preparedness for future public health emergencies.

However, the evidence that different Rab proteins can bind to common effectors challenges this view. Here, we show that molecular competition between distinct Rab GTPases for a shared protein can link diverse membrane trafficking pathways. Theoretical analysis and experimental data support a role for Zfyve26 as a part of a competitive network that modulates changes in Rab5-Rab11 abundance, activation status, and correlation at the surface of single endocytic structures. By leveraging on the Loop index, a novel metric that couples the GTP-bound fraction and the total amount of Rab GTPase, we infer the saturation of Zfyve26 molecules at the endocytic surface from time-lapse imaging data. Our findings establish that transduction in the endocytic system is governed by stoichiometric constraints determining the trade-off between different trafficking pathways at the surface of a membrane-bound organelle.",Ferro E; Bena CE; Franco I; Gamba A; Pagnani A; Bosia C,Somatic Mutation Mechanisms Unit; Department of Applied Science and Technology,

At lower concentrations, FBNs primarily integrate into the fibrillar fibrin matrix, strengthening it. At high concentrations, colloid-colloid interactions dominate and FBNs primarily form a highly aligned secondary structure that does not strengthen the fibrillar matrix. At intermediate concentrations, both reinforcement of the fibrin matrix and colloid-colloid interactions are observed. Our characterization of this colloidal-fibrillar system provides insight into new avenues for wound healing biomaterial development.

Relugolix, a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) receptor antagonist, is the only oral ADT, with limited real-world data on therapy persistence and adherence. This retrospective study evaluates persistence and adherence of relugolix, degarelix, and GnRH agonists (leuprolide, goserelin, triptorelin, histrelin) using data from the IBM MarketScan Research Database (Jan 2017 - Dec 2022). The IBM MarketScan Research Database (1 January 2017 - 31 December 2022) was used for enrollment history and claims. ADT adherence was measured by the proportion of days covered (PDC) at 3, 6, and 12 months, calculated as days on ADT divided by period duration. Kaplan-Meier analysis assessed treatment persistence by measuring time to treatment discontinuation. Relugolix had higher adherence (PDC ≥ 80%) at 12 months (60.8%) compared to degarelix (13.0%) and GnRH agonists (46.3%). Median time to discontinuation was also longer for relugolix (13.5 months) than degarelix (3.1 months) and GnRH agonists (8.8 months). Persistence and adherence rates were higher in metastatic prostate cancer. Findings support relugolix use as an oral treatment due to its favorable persistence and long-term adherence profiles. Prostate cancer is the second most common cancer among men in the US. Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), a key treatment for advanced prostate cancer, lowers testosterone levels, a hormone that helps prostate cancer grow.  ADT includes injectable gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) receptor agonists like leuprolide, which initially raise testosterone before lowering it, and antagonists like degarelix, (injectable) and relugolix (oral), which rapidly lower testosterone. A large clinical trial (phase III) showed relugolix rapidly and consistently lowered testosterone, with similar side effects to leuprolide but fewer major cardiovascular events (nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, and death from any cause).There is limited published real-world data, including healthcare information like medical records and insurance claims, on how well patients stay on treatment (persistence) and take their medication as prescribed (adherence) for different forms of ADT, especially oral relugolix.Data from the IBM MarketScan Research Database (January 2017 to December 2022) was used to compare persistence and adherence among patients taking oral relugolix, injectable degarelix, and injectable GnRH receptor agonists.Patients taking relugolix had a higher rate of adherence to their treatment (60.8%) after 12 months versus those receiving injectable degarelix (13.0%) and other injectables, GnRH receptor agonists (46.3%). Patients on relugolix also stayed on their treatment longer (13.5 months) compared to those on injectable degarelix (3.1 months) and GnRH receptor agonists (8.8 months).

Outcomes of patients with WHO grade 1 tumors with loss of chromosome 1p were comparable to those of patients with WHO grade 2 tumors (median PFS, 4.48 [95% CI, 4.09-5.18] years). Combined loss of chromosome 1p and gain of chromosome 1q were associated with outcomes that were highly concordant with WHO grade 3 tumors, regardless of initial grade (median PFS: grade 1, 2.23 [95% CI, 1.28-∞] years; grade 2, 1.90 [95% CI, 1.23-2.25] years; grade 3, 2.27 [95% CI, 1.68-3.05] years). These findings highlight a role for cytogenetic profiling in the next iteration of CNS WHO grading, with a specific focus on chromosome 1p loss and 1q gain, suggesting that chromosome 1p loss, in addition to 22q loss, should be added as a criterion for a CNS WHO grade of 2 and addition of 1q gain as a criterion for a CNS WHO grade of 3.",Ehret F; Capper D; Tsang DS,Radiation Medicine Program; Charité - Universitätsmedizin Berlin; German Cancer Consortium,

40170297,Both Proteins/Peptides and Non-Proteins/Peptides in Larval Oral Secretions of a Chewing Herbivore Function as Elicitors That Induce Plant Defenses.,,"Plant, cell & environment",10.1111/pce.15523,"Herbivore elicitors, most of which identified thus far are from the oral secretions (OS) of herbivores, are important in herbivore-induced plant defense. However, whether and how larval OS of the striped stem borer (SSB), Chilo suppressalis, a devastating pest on rice, induce plant defenses remains largely unknown. We found that treating plants with SSB OS enhanced levels of phosphorylated OsMPK3/4/6, JA, JA-Ile, ethylene, and ABA in rice, which subsequently induced the production of defense compounds, such as trypsin protease inhibitors, and decreased the growth of SSB larvae. Digestion by proteinase K decreased the induction activity of SSB OS on rice defense, but it still activated OsMPK6, JA, ABA, and ethylene pathways, and enhanced plant SSB resistance. Treating plants with SSB OS fractions that did not contain fatty acid-amino acid conjugates (FACs) activated OsMPK3/4/6, JA, ABA, and ethylene pathways, whereas treating plants with other OS fractions containing FACs did not. Bioassays revealed that impairing the JA or ABA signaling pathway in rice decreased plant SSB resistance. These results demonstrate that both proteins/peptides and non-proteins/peptides-but not FACs-in SSB OS play a central role in inducing rice defenses by activating signaling pathways mediated by JA, ABA, and ethylene.",Lin S,Hangzhou Lead Biotech Company Limited,

We explore the complexity and importance of the intestinal barrier function and how disruptions of the intestinal barrier and dysbiosis work in concert to promote the onset and progression of MASLD. The Review focuses on specific bacterial, viral, and fungal communities that impact the trajectory of MASLD and how specific metabolites (including ethanol, bile acids, short chain fatty acids, and other metabolites) contribute to disease pathogenesis. Finally, we underscore how knowledge of the interaction between gut microbes and the intestinal barrier may be leveraged for MASLD microbial-based therapeutics.

Long-term perfusion of MVNs is often required for the maturation of organ phenotypes and disease pathologies and to model the transport of cells and drugs entering organs. In our microphysiological system, we observe that flow can recover perfusion in regressed MVNs and maintain perfusable MVNs for at least 51 days. Throughout the 51 days, however, the MVNs are continuously remodeling to align with the direction of bulk flow and only appear to attain morphological homeostasis with the use of maintenance medium without growth factors. We observed that the flow resistance of the MVNs decreases over time, and using a computational model, we show that stable vessels have higher flow rates and velocities compared to regressing vessels. Cytokine analysis suggests that static conditions generate an inflammatory state, and that continuous flow reduces inflammation over an extended period. Finally, through bulk RNA sequencing we identify that both the endothelial and fibroblast cells are actively engaged in vascular and matrix remodeling due to flow and that these effects persist for at least 2 weeks. This MPS can be applied to study hemodynamically driven processes, such as metastatic dissemination or drug distribution, or to model long-term diseases previously not captured by MPS, such as chronic inflammation or aging-associated diseases.",,,

Early detection is crucial, yet traditional methods struggle with AF's transient nature. This study investigates how augmenting ECG data with heart rate variability (HRV) and demographic data (age and sex) can improve AF detection. We analysed 35 634 12-lead ECG recordings from three public databases (China Physiological Signal Challenge-Extra, PTB-XL and Georgia), each with physician-validated AF labels. A range of convolutional neural network models, including AlexNet, VGG-16, ResNet and transformers, were tested for AF prediction, enriched with HRV and demographic data to explore the effectiveness of the multimodal approach. Each data modality (ECG, HRV and demographic) was assessed for its contribution to model performance using fivefold cross-validation. Performance improvements were evaluated across key metrics, and saliency maps were generated to provide further insights into model behaviour and identify critical features in AF detection. Integrating HRV and demographic data with ECG substantially improved performance. AlexNet and VGG-16 outperformed more complex models, achieving AUROC of 0.9617 (95% CI 0.95 to 0.97) and 0.9668 (95% CI 0.96 to 0.97), respectively. Adding HRV data showed the most significant improvement in sensitivity, with AlexNet increasing from 0.9117 to 0.9225 and VGG-16 from 0.9216 to 0.9225. Combining both HRV and demographic data led to further improvements, with AlexNet achieving a sensitivity of 0.9225 (up from 0.9192 with HRV) and VGG-16 reaching 0.9113 (up from 0.9097 with HRV). The combination of HRV and demographic data resulted in the highest gains in sensitivity and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. Saliency maps confirmed the models identified key AF features, such as the absence of the P-wave, validating the multimodal approach. AlexNet and VGG-16 excelled in AF detection, with HRV data improving sensitivity, and demographic data providing additional benefits. These results highlight the potential of multimodal approaches, pending further clinical validation.",,,gupta85vibha19085@gmail.com.

Estrogen regulates multiple aspects of the nervous system including development, survival, and axonal outgrowth of DRG neurons. While previous studies have established estrogen's neuroprotective role in these neurons, the specific ER subtypes and downstream signaling pathways mediating these effects remain poorly defined. The objective of our study was to investigate the effects of 17 beta-estradiol (E2) on mitochondrial function and axonal regeneration of cultured DRG neurons and explore the pathways by which E2 acts. We observed that E2 treatment upregulated the levels of phosphorylated AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). E2 also increased the levels of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ coactivator-1α (PGC-1α) and activating transcription factor 3 (ATF3), which are proteins involved in mitochondrial biogenesis and axonal regeneration. The Seahorse assay showed that E2 elevated basal respiration in cultured DRG neurons. Additionally, E2 treatment for 24 h significantly increased total neurite outgrowth of DRG neurons.

To assess the efficacy and safety of ferric carboxymaltose in patients with heart failure and iron deficiency. This multicenter, randomized clinical trial enrolled 1105 patients with heart failure (defined as having a left ventricular ejection fraction of ≤45%) and iron deficiency (serum ferritin level <100 ng/mL; or if transferrin saturation was <20%, a serum ferritin level between 100 ng/mL and 299 ng/mL) at 70 clinic sites in 6 European countries from March 2017 to November 2023. The median follow-up was 16.6 months (IQR, 7.9-29.9 months). Administration of ferric carboxymaltose (n = 558) initially given at an intravenous dose of up to 2000 mg that was followed by 500 mg every 4 months (unless stopping criteria were met) vs a saline placebo (n = 547). The primary end point events were (1) time to cardiovascular death or first heart failure hospitalization, (2) total heart failure hospitalizations, and (3) time to cardiovascular death or first heart failure hospitalization in patients with a transferrin saturation less than 20%. All end point events were measured through follow-up. The end points would be considered statistically significant if they fulfilled at least 1 of the following conditions: (1) P ≤ .05 for all 3 of the end point comparisons, (2) P ≤ .025 for 2 of the end point comparisons, or (3) P ≤ .0167 for any of the 3 end point comparisons (Hochberg procedure). Of the 1105 participants (mean age, 70 years [SD, 12 years]; 33% were women), cardiovascular death or first heart failure hospitalization (first primary outcome) occurred in 141 in the ferric carboxymaltose group vs 166 in the placebo group (hazard ratio, 0.79 [95% CI, 0.63-0.99]; P = .04). The second primary outcome (total heart failure hospitalizations) occurred 264 times in the ferric carboxymaltose group vs 320 times in the placebo group (rate ratio, 0.80 [95% CI, 0.60-1.06]; P = .12). The third primary outcome (cardiovascular death or first heart failure hospitalization in patients with a transferrin saturation <20%) occurred in 103 patients in the ferric carboxymaltose group vs 128 patients in the placebo group (hazard ratio, 0.79 [95% CI, 0.61-1.02], P = .07). A similar amount of patients had at least 1 serious adverse event in the ferric carboxymaltose group (269; 48.2%) vs in the placebo group (273; 49.9%) (P = .61).

This foundation provides for robust control of error rates during hypothesis testing and correct coverage probability during confidence interval estimation of accuracy parameters, in well defined populations for transparent generalisability. The intention-to-diagnose principle requires distinguishing between various non-positive non-negative (NPNN) test results, such as equivocal and invalid results, and appropriate handling of these distinct results during statistical analyses. Pragmatic application accuracy, pragmatic scientific accuracy, and explanatory scientific accuracy are three major research foci in studies of diagnostic test accuracy. Selection of appropriate analysis sets and appropriate handling of NPNN results depend on the specific focus. Selection has important implications regarding preservation of the foundation for statistical inference, generalisability, and comparability with results from other studies. We recommended analyses for diagnostic accuracy studies that include the estimation of accuracy parameters associated with each research foci. A free online tool is available to estimate these accuracy parameters. As with dedicated commitment to the intention-to-treat principle in clinical trials, commitment to application of the intention-to-diagnose principle will lead to studies with high integrity, a comprehensive understanding of the scientific and administration characteristics of the diagnostic test, clarity of interpretation and generalisability, and better clinical decision making.",Petrides V; Meier K; Galicia NP,Foundation Medicine; Silver Spring; Abbott,sevans@bsc.gwu.edu.

These patients face high hospitalization risks, impacting clinical outcomes and health care resources. The Effect of Sotagliflozin on Cardiovascular Events in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Post Worsening Heart Failure (SOLOIST-WHF) trial showed that sotagliflozin, a sodium-glucose cotransporter inhibitor, reduced rehospitalizations in patients with HF and diabetes mellitus. Although clinically beneficial, the economic impact of sotagliflozin from a payer perspective remains unclear, warranting further pharmacoeconomic analysis to guide managed care decisions. To quantify the budget impact of sotagliflozin for US payers over a 5-year time horizon. A payer-perspective budget impact model was developed to assess the financial impact of incorporating sotagliflozin for the treatment of patients recently hospitalized for HF with comorbid type 2 diabetes (T2D) over 5 years to US payer health plans. The study used a population reflecting the SOLOIST-WHF clinical trial, with economic parameters adjusted by payer mix (all payer, commercial, Medicare, and Medicaid). Health care resource utilization included hospitalization, emergency department (ED) visit, and adverse events' care. Economic outcomes examined the medical and pharmacy budget impact for payers at the per-user, per member per month (PMPM), and total plan costs levels. For a hypothetical 1-million-member all-payer plan, 1,516 patients hospitalized for HF with comorbid T2D would be eligible for sotagliflozin. For all-payer plans, annual per-user costs increased by $4,996 because of higher pharmacy costs ($8,260) but were partially offset by lower medical costs (-$2,608) because of reduced rehospitalization and ED visits from sotagliflozin. PMPM total budget impact of sotagliflozin would be $0.08 PMPM in year 1 and $0.38 in year 5, corresponding with total plan cost of $75,736 in year 1 and $378,681 by year 5. Commercial payer PMPM costs were lower ($0.02 in year 1; $0.11 in year 5), and higher for Medicare ($0.23 PMPM in year 1, increasing to 1.13 PMPM in year 5). Breakeven rebate rates ranged between 31.5% and 79.4%.

It also induces changes in regulatory mechanisms of the gut, which is the largest peripheral immune organ. The gut-liver axis is important for health and disease, and alterations in the intestinal immune system contribute to alcohol-associated liver disease (ALD). Understanding these changes might help discover new targets for drugs and therapeutic approaches.

Eligible manuscripts included studies and reviews that discussed the effects of ethanol on immune cells in the intestine. A total of 506 publications were found in the databases on November 20, 2023. After excluding duplicates and research not covering ALD (415 articles), 91 studies were reviewed. Also included were manuscripts covering specific immune cells in the context of ALD. Balancing immune tolerance vs. initiating an immune response challenges the intestinal immune system. Alcohol induces disruption of the intestinal barrier, which is accompanied by a thicker mucus layer and reduced anti-microbial peptides. This leads to longer attachment of bacteria to epithelial cells and consequently greater translocation into the circulation. Bacterial translocation activates the immune system, reducing the activity of regulatory T cells and inducing T helper 17 response via a variety of pathways. The role of innate immune cells, especially Type 3 innate lymphoid cells, and of specific B- and T-cell subsets in ALD remains elusive. Gut dysbiosis, translocation of viable bacteria and bacterial products into the circulation, and changes in the intestinal barrier have been linked to immune deficiency and infections in patients with cirrhosis. Modifying the intestinal immune system could reduce intestinal inflammation and alcohol-induced liver injury.

A critical component of C. acnes biofilms is poly-N-acetylglucosamine (PNAG), an exopolysaccharide that facilitates both biofilm stability and biocide resistance. This study evaluated the efficacy of the PNAG-degrading enzyme dispersin B in enhancing the susceptibility of C. acnes biofilms to benzoyl peroxide (BP), a common anti-acne agent. Dual-species biofilms of C. acnes and Staphylococcus epidermidis, which has been shown to promote C. acnes biofilm growth under aerobic conditions, were cultivated in glass tubes and treated with dispersin B (5-80 µg/mL), BP (0.1-2.5%), or a combination of both. Dispersin B or BP alone reduced C. acnes colony-forming units (CFUs) by 1-2 log units. However, sequential treatment with dispersin B followed by BP achieved a synergistic effect, yielding a >6-log reduction in CFUs. Remarkably, concentrations as low as 5 µg/mL dispersin B combined with 0.5% BP efficiently eradicated C. acnes from the dual-species biofilms. These findings highlight the protective role of PNAG against BP and demonstrate the potential of dispersin B as an adjunctive therapy to enhance the efficacy of BP in acne treatment.",Muzaleva A; Sailer M; Huizinga RB,Kane Biotech,

This trend is also evident in Latin America, where life expectancy is improving, though at varying rates across countries and regions. Partnering with the Neurosciences Group of Antioquia (GNA), we launched a Colombian study on resilience in families with autosomal dominant Alzheimer's disease and the oldest-old population. Over the past 2 years, the project has expanded to include participants from Peru, Chile, and Costa Rica. This research led to the first symposium on Brain Resilience and Healthy Longevity, held in Medellín, Colombia, in August 2024. The article summarizes key discussions from the symposium, highlighting the most promising opportunities for brain resilience and prevention research in the region and offering recommendations for future research to promote healthy aging and dementia-free communities. Uncovering the genetic and physiological drivers of cognitive resilience, neurodegeneration resistance, and healthy longevity is essential for maintaining brain function as we age. ""Superagers"" and cognitively resilient individuals from Latin American families with Alzheimer's disease offer valuable insights into brain protection mechanisms. Studying the interplay of socio-environmental and genetic factors in the oldest-old is key to understanding healthy longevity and improving dementia prevention.

Preclinical studies suggest that combining these drugs with avelumab (anti-PD-L1 antibody) can potentially synergize this effect. In addition, tissue abscopal effects of radiation therapy may improve antigen presentation, complementing PD-L1 blockade. We conducted a single institution, open-label, multi-arm, non-randomized, phase 1/2 clinical trial of avelumab in combination with ivuxolimab, with or without utomilumab, and radiation therapy in patients with advanced solid tumors. Herein, we present a subgroup analysis in patients with gastrointestinal (GI) tumors (pancreatic, colon, gastric, and hepatocellular). The primary objectives of this study were to assess safety, tolerability, and dose-limiting toxicities. The secondary objectives were to evaluate efficacy including response rate, progression free survival (PFS), as determined by immune-related Response Criteria in Solid Tumors (irRECIST) and overall survival (OS). Thirty-one patients with pancreatic (n = 21), colorectal (n = 8), hepatocellular (n = 1), and gastric (n = 1) cancers were included in this study.

40137785,Neuropsychological Performance: How Mental Health Drives Attentional Function in University-Level Football Athletes.,,"Sports (Basel, Switzerland)",10.3390/sports13030061,"This preliminary study investigates the potential relationship between electrophysiological profiles measured by quantitative electroencephalography (QEEG) and attentional performance in 34 university American football players. QEEG data revealed patterns associated with burnout, chronic pain, and insomnia among the athletes. Attentional performance was generally average, but players exhibited faster reaction times in the alertness task without warning, fewer errors in the sustained attention task, and lower scores in the divided attention task, favoring visual information over auditory information. Significant negative correlations emerged between QEEG profiles associated with burnout, ADHD, depression, and anxiety and specific attentional subcomponents. These findings suggest a link between mental health-related brain activity and attentional performance. In a clinical context, they emphasize the need for early detection and intervention in mental health problems. This might improve cognitive performance and well-being in athletes. However, due to the small sample size and the lack of a control group, these results are considered preliminary, and further research is required to confirm and expand on these associations.",Branco Lopes A,Spectre Biotech,

However, there is a little scientific unanimity whether these properties are due to the procyanidin content or to the length of their polymers. The main reason for this doubt is the technical difficulties related to their separation. Therefore, a preparative separation of grape seed extract was carried out using an integrated ultra/diafiltration procedure with membranes of 300, 30, 5, and 1 kDa molecular mass cut-offs, reverse osmosis and solid-phase extraction to obtain fractions of very high (>300 kDa), high (300-30 kDa), intermediate (30-5 kDa), low molecular mass (5-1 kDa), very-low-mass polar molecules and ions (<1 kDa), and very-low-mass dipole molecules (<1 kDa). Process parameters, mass transfer across the membranes and the quality of separation of each fraction are described and discussed in depth. A high degree of purification was achieved for the higher-molecular-mass fractions (>300, 300-30, and 30-5 kDa), as well as the big majority of procyanidin polymers and oligomers from very-low-molecular-mass species. All fractions were characterized for their procyanidin content by normal phase high-performance liquid chromatography coupled to a photodiode array detector (NP-HPLC-PAD).

Here, we developed a method that enables the monitoring of RNA-protein interactions through a reporter system in bacteria with high temporal resolution. For this, we used a Real-Time Protein Expression Assay (RT-PEA) technology for real-time monitoring of a fluorescent reporter protein, while having bacteria growing on solid media. Experimental results were analyzed by fitting a three-variable Gompertz growth model. To validate the method, the interactions between a set of RNA sequences and the RNA-binding protein (RBP) Musashi-1 (MSI1) were evaluated, as well as the allosteric modulation of the interaction by a small molecule (oleic acid). This new approach proved to be suitable to quantitatively characterize RNA-RBP interactions, thereby expanding the toolbox to study molecular interactions in living bacteria, including allosteric modulation, with special relevance for systems that are not suitable to be studied in liquid media.",Pérez-Ropero G; Pérez-Ràfols A; Andersson K; Buijs J,Ridgeview Instruments AB; Giotto Biotech SRL,

PDE4 provides spatial and temporal precision to cAMP signalling, particularly under β-adrenergic stimulation, through its compartmentalised activity in subcellular nanodomains, including the sarcoplasmic reticulum, plasma membrane and nuclear envelope. This review highlights the cardiac PDE4 isoforms PDE4A, PDE4B and PDE4D, focusing on their distinct localisation and contributions to cardiac physiology and pathophysiology, particularly in heart failure and arrhythmias. Although PDE4 plays a smaller role in overall cAMP hydrolysis in human hearts than in rodents, its compartmentalised function remains critical. Recent therapeutic advances have shifted from pan-PDE4 inhibitors to isoform-specific approaches to enhance efficacy while minimising systemic toxicity. We discuss the potential of selective PDE4 modulators, gene therapies and combination strategies in restoring cAMP compartmentation and preventing maladaptive cardiac remodelling. By integrating rodent and human studies, this review underscores the translational challenges and therapeutic opportunities surrounding PDE4, positioning it as both a key regulator of cardiac signalling and a promising target for heart failure therapies.",,,

If probiotics can secrete the recombinant insulins that may help suppress DM development, then it would likely have very few adverse side effects. To produce insulin analogs in bacteria, recombinant insulin (insulin-CBT1) should be the single-chain insulin (SCI) similar to proinsulin. However, insulin-CBT1 should allow the protein to activate insulin receptors directly without the need for proteolytic cleavage. In this study, we evaluated the effect of the flexible linker peptide on the physical and structural characteristics of insulin-CBT1 compared with commercial insulin (c-insulin). In the results, the linker peptide had marked effects on polarity and structure by increasing the α-helix content (19.3%→25.6%). Furthermore, insulin-CBT1 induced MIN6 proliferation 1.75-fold more than c-insulin, whereas differentiation and glucose uptake rates by 3T3-L1 were 39% and 15% lower, respectively. The biological anti-diabetes properties of insulin-CBT1 were well evaluated compared with c-insulin. Furthermore, we first suggest a special method for oral administration of insulin-CBT 1 without damage to the digestive tract. We developed an insulin-CBT1 delivery system using ",,,

This study sought to describe the metabolic changes seen with fludeoxyglucose-18-positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) following neoadjuvant immunotherapy in patients with melanoma and explore associations with pathological response and recurrence-free survival (RFS). Data from patients with macroscopic stage III nodal melanoma treated with neoadjuvant checkpoint inhibitor therapy were pooled from five melanoma centers. All patients underwent baseline and preoperative FDG-PET and CT assessments, and all had surgery. Pathological response was determined using the International Neoadjuvant Melanoma Consortium criteria, radiological response using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria, and FDG-PET response using European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) criteria. The primary endpoint was to explore the associations of metabolic and radiological responses with pathological response; secondary endpoints were RFS outcomes stratified by each response category. 115 patients were included, 69% male, median age 59 years (27-92), 43% BRAF mutant, and median follow-up was 22.2 months (95% CI 13.7 to 26.4). 40 patients received anti-PD-1 monotherapy, 20 patients received pembrolizumab combined with lenvatinib, and 55 patients received ipilimumab and nivolumab. The major pathological response (MPR) rate was 62%, and the pathological complete response rate was 51%. RECIST response underestimated pathological response; patients achieving RECIST stable disease (38%) had a 50% chance of achieving MPR. The FDG-PET metabolic response rate was 73%, with most achieving an MPR (80%), especially in patients with a complete metabolic response (CMR, 96% MPR). A small proportion of patients (10%) had stable metabolic disease on FDG-PET, and all these patients were non-MPR. Patients with progressive metabolic disease were also in the majority non-MPR (79%). Patients with MPR, complete response/partial response on CT, and CMR/partial metabolic response on FDG-PET had a favorable 24-month RFS (95.6%, 97.3%, and 93.7%, respectively), with FDG-PET able to identify a greater proportion of patients with favorable progression-free survival (PFS) than pathology or CT (73%, 62%, and 43%, respectively).

In this 12-center study, a 19-item survey exploring preferred management strategy for symptomatic older adults (≥75 years) with or without known CAD, and major patient and clinical factors driving this decision making was administered to clinicians. There were 96 respondents (70.8 % cardiologists, 20.9 % primary care physicians/geriatricians). Among patients without known CAD, 59 (61.4 %) respondents favored early referral to testing, 6 (6.3 %) opted for initial GDMT and 23 (24.0 %) preferred both. For patients with known CAD, 27 (28.1 %) prioritized initial GDMT optimization, 37 (38.6 %) would refer for early testing and 19.8 % both. Key factors influencing initial preference for GDMT optimization were unoptimized anti-anginal medications, patient preference, increased complication risk, frailty, cognitive impairment and comorbidities. Key factors influencing preference for initial imaging were increasing symptom severity, already optimized GDMT, and electrocardiogram changes. When imaging revealed ischemia, clinicians reported weighing symptom severity, ischemic burden, current medications, comorbidities, frailty, and procedural risks before referring for invasive cardiac angiography.

Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) has emerged as a promising biomarker for assessing molecular residual disease (MRD) in various malignancies. However, there are limited studies evaluating the utility of ctDNA for predicting recurrence risk in patients with ESCC. We prospectively enrolled patients with locally advanced ESCC who were scheduled to receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) followed by surgery. This report retrospectively analyzed ctDNA with a personalized, tumor-informed 16-plex mPCR-NGS assay at multiple time points: pre-NAC, post-NAC but before surgery, postoperatively, and longitudinally during follow-up. A total of 28 patients who underwent curative surgery, and had successful whole-exome sequencing analysis of tumor tissue samples were included in this report. At the pre-NAC time point, ctDNA was detected in 50% of patients with stage I and 100% of those with stages II, III, and IV. Post-NAC but before surgery, ctDNA was detected in 33.3% of patients. The recurrence rate was 77.8% in ctDNA-positive patients compared to 27.8% in ctDNA-negative patients, with significantly worse recurrence-free survival (RFS) for ctDNA-positive patients vs. ctDNA-negative patients (HR: 4.56, P =0.01). In patients analyzed during the MRD window (2-16 weeks post-surgery), the recurrence rate was 100% in ctDNA-positive patients compared to 30.4% in ctDNA-negative patients, with significantly worse RFS (HR: 30.99, P <0.0001). Similarly, during surveillance (>16 weeks post-surgery), detectable ctDNA was significantly associated with poor RFS (HR: 27.34, P =0.003).

Corneal conjunctivalization, neovascularization, and persistent inflammation are hallmarks of LSCD. Ocular exposure to SM and NM results in an acute and delayed phase of corneal disruption, culminating in LSCD. Available therapies for mustard keratopathy (e.g., topical corticosteroids) often have adverse side effects, and generally are ineffective in preventing the development of LSCD. We developed a novel, optically transparent HDL nanoparticle (NP) with an organic core (oc) molecular scaffold. This unique oc-HDL NP: (i) markedly improved corneal haze during the acute and delayed phases in vivo; (ii) significantly reduced the inflammatory response; and (iii) blunted conjunctivalization and corneal neovascularization during the delayed phase.

Least-squares mean change from baseline in PROs at week 17 was assessed using a constrained longitudinal data analysis model. Time to deterioration in physical functioning (prespecified) and role functioning (post hoc), as assessed by the EORTC QLQ-C30, were also evaluated in the PRO analysis population. This trial is ongoing, closed to recruitment, and registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04195750. Between March 10, 2020, and Jan 19, 2022, 996 participants were screened for eligibility and 746 participants were randomly assigned to belzutifan (n=374) or everolimus (n=372). The PRO full analysis set population included 366 participants in the belzutifan group and 354 in the everolimus group. Median time from randomisation to the database cutoff date (June 13, 2023) was 25·7 months (IQR 21·7-30·4). Completion rates for FKSI-DRS and QLQ-C30 were higher than 94% at baseline and higher than 55% at week 17 in each group. Change from baseline to week 17 in FKSI-DRS score (difference in least-squares mean between groups 1·5 [95% CI 0·7 to 2·2]) and QLQ-C30 global health status-quality of life (QOL) score (6·4 [3·2 to 9·6]) suggested stability with belzutifan versus worsening with everolimus. Change from baseline to week 17 was similar between groups for QLQ-C30 physical functioning (difference in least-squares mean 2·5 [95% CI -0·6 to 5·5]) and QLQ-C30 role functioning (4·2 [0·1 to 8·4]) subscale scores. Time to deterioration was similar between the belzutifan and everolimus groups for EORTC physical functioning (median 19·3 months [95% CI 11·1 to not reached] in the belzutifan group vs 13·8 months [10·6 to not reached] in the everolimus group; hazard ratio 0·93 [95% CI 0·72 to 1·20]) and role functioning (median 12·0 months [9·2 to not reached] vs 10·2 months [4·7 to 14·4]; 0·88 [0·69 to 1·11]). Belzutifan for advanced renal cell carcinoma was associated with improved disease-specific symptoms and QOL compared with everolimus. Taken together with the efficacy and safety data from LITESPARK-005, belzutifan could offer a clinical benefit without compromising the QOL of patients in this setting.

AL was formulated as an inactive prodrug of aripiprazole using LinkeRx Treatment of schizophrenia with continuous antipsychotic medication has been shown to improve symptoms, daily functioning, and quality of life. One important option for antipsychotic treatment is a long-acting injectable medication. Antipsychotic injections can be administered weeks or months apart in place of daily oral medication. Aripiprazole lauroxil is a long-acting injectable antipsychotic for adults with schizophrenia that has several important features; it provides continuous, stable medication after monthly, every-6-week, or every-2-month injections, and multiple dose options are available (see video abstract). In addition, patients can start treatment with aripiprazole lauroxil using either a 1-day or 21-day initiation regimen with their first dose. The 1-day initiation regimen allows people with schizophrenia to start treatment during a doctor’s office visit or during a brief stay in the hospital. In short-term studies, aripiprazole lauroxil significantly reduced symptoms of acute schizophrenia. In longer-term studies, side effects were similar to those expected when using oral aripiprazole, and symptoms improved over extended durations of treatment lasting up to 3.5 years. Aripiprazole lauroxil’s safety and efficacy profile and multiple dosing and initiation options make it a treatment option for schizophrenia in inpatient and outpatient settings.",Dunbar M; Hopkinson C; McGrory JA; Rege B; McDonnell D,Alkermes Pharma Ireland Ltd; Alkermes,

The authors analyzed individual participant-level data from 1052 patients with mCSPC who were randomized in the TITAN trial (apalutamide vs. placebo, both with androgen-deprivation therapy). Outcomes included radiographic progression-free survival (PFS), second PFS (PFS2), and overall survival (OS). Multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression models, with and without restricted cubic splines, were used to determine the association between apalutamide benefit and bone metastasis count or visceral metastasis. Subgroup treatment effects were quantified based on inverse probability of treatment weighting-adjusted hazard ratios (HRs). Analysis using restricted cubic splines indicated that apalutamide provided less benefit for PFS2 and OS in patients with fewer bone metastases. The authors also found evidence of a heterogeneous effect of apalutamide on PFS2 and OS between patients with two or less bone metastases and those with three or more bone metastases. In patients who had two or less bone metastases, there was no evidence of a benefit from apalutamide for radiographic PFS (HR, 0.65; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.35-1.22), PFS2 (HR, 1.18; 95% CI, 0.66-2.12), or OS (HR, 1.05; 95% CI, 0.60-1.83). No evidence of an association was noted between visceral metastasis and apalutamide benefit. The addition of apalutamide to androgen-deprivation therapy may provide less benefit in patients with mCSPC who have fewer bone metastases. Counting baseline bone metastases may help identify optimal candidates for apalutamide treatment of mCSPC. NCT02489318 PLAIN LANGUAGE SUMMARY: In an analysis of individual participant data from a trial (the TITAN trial) in patients with metastatic (spreading) castration-sensitive prostate cancer, treatment intensification based on the addition new drugs to standard androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT) was analyzed and compared with the effects in patients who received only standard ADT. Compared with ADT alone, the survival benefit of adding the new drug apalutamide to standard ADT varied according to the number of bone metastases, but no association was observed between the spread of cancer to soft tissues and organs and a survival benefit from adding apalutamide. The results indicate that counting the number of bone metastases may help identify which patients with metastatic castration-sensitive prostate cancer are optimal candidates for treatment intensification with the addition of apalutamide to standard ADT.",,,

The best approach to identify patients with such tumors is unclear in prostate cancer. This study included 1,016 men diagnosed with primary prostate cancer during prospective follow-up of the Health Professionals Follow-up Study and Physicians' Health Study. The highest-grade/index lesions from radical prostatectomy (95%) or transurethral resections of the prostate were mounted on tissue microarrays. Scoring of immunohistochemistry for the MMR proteins MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, and PMS2 required a nontumor internal positive control for designating deficiency. Validation was done on full sections and with PCR-based quantification of microsatellite repeats. Tumor stage was predominantly pathologically localized with a full distribution of Gleason scores. MMR tumor scoring could be performed with available internal positive control tissue in 75% to 90% of cases, depending on the MMR protein. Of the 903 tumors evaluable for MSH2 protein loss, 4 tumors had loss of MSH2 (prevalence, 0.4%; 95% confidence interval, 0.2%-1.1%), and 3 of 708 evaluable tumors had concomitant loss of MSH6 (prevalence, 0.4%; 95% confidence interval, 0.1%-1.2%). No tumor had loss of MLH1 or PMS2. The four MMR-deficient cases had higher Gleason scores, and three had non-zero microsatellite repeats. In this nationwide prospective study, MMR deficiency was rare in primary, surgically treated prostate cancer. The low prevalence and the need for an internal positive control for this assay are feasibility concerns for unselected routine immunohistochemistry-based screening for MMR deficiency on limited tissue specimens, such as prostate biopsies.",,,

When and whether a second agent, such as vasopressin, should be added is unknown. To derive and validate a reinforcement learning model to determine the optimal initiation rule for vasopressin in adult, critically ill patients receiving norepinephrine for septic shock. Reinforcement learning was used to generate the optimal rule for vasopressin initiation to improve short-term and hospital outcomes, using electronic health record data from 3608 patients who met the Sepsis-3 shock criteria at 5 California hospitals from 2012 to 2023. The rule was evaluated in 628 patients from the California dataset and 3 external datasets comprising 10 217 patients from 227 US hospitals, using weighted importance sampling and pooled logistic regression with inverse probability weighting. Clinical, laboratory, and treatment variables grouped hourly for 120 hours in the electronic health record. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. The derivation cohort (n = 3608) included 2075 men (57%) and had a median (IQR) age of 63 (56-70) years and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score at shock onset of 5 (3-7 [range, 0-24, with higher scores associated with greater mortality]). The validation cohorts (n = 10 217) were 56% male (n = 5743) with a median (IQR) age of 67 (57-75) years and a SOFA score of 6 (4-9). In validation data, the model suggested vasopressin initiation in more patients (87% vs 31%), earlier relative to shock onset (median [IQR], 4 [1-8] vs 5 [1-14] hours), and at lower norepinephrine doses (median [IQR], 0.20 [0.08-0.45] vs 0.37 [0.17-0.69] µg/kg/min) compared with clinicians' actions. The rule was associated with a larger expected reward in validation data compared with clinician actions (weighted importance sampling difference, 31 [95% CI, 15-52]). The adjusted odds of hospital mortality were lower if vasopressin initiation was similar to the rule compared with different (odds ratio, 0.81 [95% CI, 0.73-0.91]), a finding consistent across external validation sets. In adult patients with septic shock receiving norepinephrine, the use of vasopressin was variable. A reinforcement learning model developed and validated in several observational datasets recommended more frequent and earlier use of vasopressin than average care patterns and was associated with reduced mortality.",Kalimouttou A; Pirracchio R,Inserm UMR 1153,

Now, recent achievements suggest that nanopores might be able to sequence proteins soon. In this Perspective, we analyze the different approaches that have been proposed to measure proteins and peptides using nanopores. We predict that, more likely than not, nanopores will be capable of identifying full-length proteins at the single-molecule level and with single-amino acid resolution, paving the way to single-molecule protein sequencing. This would allow several applications in proteomics that are at present challenging, including measuring the heterogeneity of post-translational modifications, quantifying low-abundance proteins and characterizing protein splicing.",,,giovanni.maglia@rug.nl.
40096169,"The elevated expression of ORF75, a KSHV lytic gene, in Kaposi sarcoma lesions is driven by a GC-rich DNA cis element in its promoter region.",2025-04-09,PLoS pathogens,10.1371/journal.ppat.1012984,"The spindle cells of Kaposi sarcoma (KS) lesions primarily express Kaposi sarcoma herpesvirus (KSHV) latent genes with minimal expression of lytic genes. However, recent transcriptome analyses of KS lesions have shown high expression of KSHV open reading frame (ORF) 75, which is considered a late lytic gene based on analyses in primary effusion lymphoma (PEL) lines. ORF75 encodes a pseudo-amidotransferase that is part of the viral tegument, acts as a suppressor of innate immunity, and is essential for viral lytic replication. We assessed a representative KS lesion by RNAscope and found that ORF75 RNA was expressed in the majority of latency-associated nuclear antigen (LANA)-expressing cells. Luciferase fusion reporter constructs of the ORF75 promoter were analyzed for factors potentially driving its expression in KS. The ORF75 promoter construct showed high basal transcriptional activity in vitro in endothelial cells, mediated by a proximal consensus specificity protein 1 (Sp1) (GGGGCGGGGC) element along with two distal CCAAT boxes. Sp proteins formed complexes with the proximal consensus Sp1 element to activate ORF75 promoter transcription. We also found evidence that a repressive factor or factors in B cells, but not endothelial or epithelial cells, interacted with more distal elements in the ORF75 promoter region to repress constitutive ORF75 expression in B cells. Alternate forms of Sp1 were found to accumulate during latency and showed substantial enrichment during viral lytic replication in PEL cells and infected endothelial cells, but their functional significance is unclear. We also found that ORF75 can in turn upregulate its own expression and that of other KSHV genes. Thus, while ORF75 acts primarily as a lytic gene in PEL cell lines, Sp proteins induce substantial constitutive ORF75 transcription in infected endothelial cells and this can account for its high expression in KS lesions.",,,

These analyses involved the largest number of pancreas samples collected to date. The aim of the current work was to examine the presence of enterovirus RNA in pancreas and lymphoid tissues of organ donors with and without type 1 diabetes. We analysed pancreas, spleen, pancreatic lymph nodes and duodenum samples from the following groups: (1) donors with type 1 diabetes (n=71) with (n=35) or without (n=36) insulin-containing islets; (2) donors with single or double islet autoantibody positivity without diabetes (n=22); and (3) autoantibody-negative donors without diabetes (control donors) (n=74). Five research laboratories participated in this collaborative effort using approaches for unbiased discovery of RNA viruses (two RNA-Seq platforms), targeted detection of Enterovirus A-D species using RT-PCR, and tests for virus growth in cell culture. Direct RNA-Seq did not detect virus signal in pancreas samples, whereas RT-PCR detected enterovirus RNA confirmed by sequencing in low amounts in pancreas samples in three of the five donor groups: donors with type 1 diabetes with insulin-containing islets, 16% (5/32) being positive; donors with single islet autoantibody positivity, 53% (8/15) being positive; and non-diabetic donors, 8% (4/49) being positive. Detection of enterovirus RNA was significantly more frequent in single islet autoantibody-positive donors compared with donors with type 1 diabetes with insulin-deficient islets (p<0.001) and control (non-diabetic) donors (p=0.004). In some donors, pancreatic lymph nodes were also positive. RT-PCR detected enterovirus RNA also in the spleen of a small number of donors and virus enrichment in susceptible cell lines before RT-PCR resulted in much higher rate in spleen positivity, particularly in donors with type 1 diabetes. Interestingly, the enterovirus strains detected did not cause a typical lytic infection, possibly reflecting their persistence-prone nature. This was the largest coordinated effort to examine the presence of enterovirus RNA in the pancreas of organ donors with type 1 diabetes, using a multitude of assays. These findings are consistent with the notion that donors with type 1 diabetes and donors with islet autoantibodies may carry a low-grade enterovirus infection in the pancreas and lymphoid tissues.",Plagnol V; ,; Genomics PLC,jutta.laiho@tuni.fi.

The viroid was detected in asymptomatic stock plants and in rooted vegetative cuttings, as well as in recirculated nutrient solution sampled from propagation tables and nozzles. Plant-to-plant spread through root infection in hydroponic cultivation was demonstrated. The viroid survived for 7 days and 4 weeks, respectively, in crushed leaf extracts (sap) or dried leaves/roots at room temperature. Following stem inoculation with infectious sap, HLVd was detected in root tissues within 2-3 weeks and in the foliage within 4-6 weeks. Plants grown under a 12:12 h photoperiod to induce inflorescence development showed more rapid spread of HLVd compared to 24 h lighting. The viroid was subsequently detected in inflorescence tissues, in trichome glands, in dried cannabis flowers and in crude resinous oil extracts. Anthers and pollen from infected male plants and seeds from infected female plants contained HLVd, giving rise to up to 100% infected seedlings. Artificially inoculated tomato and tobacco plants supported viroid replication in roots and leaves. Infected cannabis leaf and root tissues treated with UV-C for 3-5 min or temperatures of 70-90 °C for 30 min contained amplifiable HLVd-RNA. Infectious plant extract treated with 5-10% bleach (0.825% NaOCl) or 1000 ppm hypochlorous acid yielded no RT-PCR bands, suggesting the RNA was degraded.

It is unclear whether prior adjuvant anti-PD-1 therapy is associated with altered response to subsequent ICI treatment in the metastatic setting. Using data from the European Melanoma Registry (EUMelaReg), we analyzed the efficiency of first-line (1L) ICI in non-resectable or metastatic melanoma after failure from prior adjuvant anti-PD-1 treatment. Both single-agent anti-PD-1 and combined anti-PD-1/CTLA-4 (Ipi/Nivo) 1L regimes were included in the analysis. We identified 389 patients receiving 1L ICI with prior adjuvant anti-PD-1 treatment. The control population was selected from a pool of 3390 PD-1-naive cases by 1:1 matching for the type of 1L ICI and various prognostic factors.

We used wild-type (WT), FcγR-deficient, and human FcγRIIB transgenic (Tg) mice with either a functional intracellular domain (hFcγRIIB Tg) or lacking immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif (ITIM) signalling capacity (NoTIM). Targeting mouse FcγRII and human FcγRIIB with antibodies significantly augmented humoral immune responses against experimental antigens and enhanced tumour clearance in vivo. Surprisingly, mAbs without a functional Fc (N297Q; referred to as Fc-null) lacked efficacy. Similarly, blocking FcγRII in mice lacking activating FcγRs failed to enhance immune responses. Conversely, blocking both signalling-competent and signalling-defective (NoTIM) FcγRIIB in Tg mice with a WT, but not Fc-null, FcγRIIB mAb equally enhanced immunity. These data indicate the redundancy of inhibitory signalling in potentiating immune responses in vivo. Collectively, our data suggest that mAb-targeting of FcγRIIB stabilizes mAb Fc and enhances immune responses via Fc-mediated crosslinking of activating FcγRs, irrespective of the inhibitory function of FcγRIIB. These findings support a strategy to boost immune responses in immunization protocols.",,,

Randomised clinical trials (RCTs) are essential for trustworthy comparisons of intervention effects, but conventional RCTs are costly, cumbersome, inflexible, and often turn out inconclusive. Adaptive platform trials may mitigate these issues and have higher probabilities of obtaining conclusive results faster and at lower costs per participant. The Intensive Care Platform Trial (INCEPT) is an investigator-initiated, pragmatic, randomised, embedded, multifactorial, international, adaptive platform trial including adults acutely admitted to ICUs. INCEPT will assess comparable groups of interventions (primarily commonly used interventions with clinical uncertainty and practice variation) nested in domains. Interventions may be either open-label or masked. New domains will continuously be added to the platform. INCEPT assesses multiple core outcomes selected following substantial stakeholder involvement: mortality, days alive without life support/out of hospital/free of delirium, health-related quality of life, cognitive function, and safety outcomes. Each domain will use one of these core outcomes as the primary outcome. INCEPT primarily uses Bayesian statistical methods with neutral, minimally informative or sceptical priors, adjustment for important prognostic baseline variables, and calculation of absolute and relative differences in the intention-to-treat populations. Domains and intervention arms may be stopped for superiority/inferiority, practical equivalence, or futility according to pre-specified adaptation rules evaluated using statistical simulation or at pre-specified maximum sample sizes. Domains may use response-adaptive randomisation, meaning that more participants will be allocated to interventions with higher probabilities of being superior. INCEPT provides an efficient, pragmatic, and flexible platform for comparing the effects of many interventions used in adult ICU patients. The adaptive design enables the trial to use accumulating data to improve the treatment of future participants. INCEPT will provide high-certainty, conclusive evidence for many interventions, directly inform clinical practice, and thus improve patient-important outcomes.",Schjørring OL; Rasmussen BS; Mathiesen O; Poulsen LM; Strøm T; Keus F; Brøchner AC; Itenov TS; Cronhjort M; Laake JH; Hästbacka J; Pfortmueller CA; Siegemund M; Sigurdsson MI,Collaboration for Research in Intensive Care (CRIC),

The lack of an effective immunosuppressive regimen, combined with single-cell transplantations, results in suboptimal outcomes, such as poor engraftment and compromised therapeutic efficacy. This study aimed to confirm the increased retention of hiPSC-CMs microtissues (CMTs) over single-cell grafts. To ensure the long-term survival of CMTs for potential cardiac applications, CMTs were transplanted in a porcine model of MI using a triple immunosuppression protocol designed to limit immune cell infiltration. Acute evaluation of spherical hiPSC-CMs aggregates and dissociated aggregates followed by the development of a triple immunosuppression protocol were performed in healthy animals. Long-term survival of CMTs was later examined in pigs that underwent a transient coronary occlusion. Two weeks post-MI, the immunosuppression treatment was initiated and on day 28 the animals were transplanted with CMTs and followed for four more weeks. Acutely, CMTs showed superior retention compared to their dissociated counterparts. The immunosuppression regimen led to no organ damage and stable levels of circulating drugs once optimal dose was achieved. Two weeks post-xenotransplantation in healthy pigs, histology revealed that immunosuppressed animals displayed a significant decrease in total cellular infiltrates, particularly in CD3",Halloin C,Cell Therapy Process Development,aina.cervera@gmail.com.

Myeloid-derived suppressor cells promote a hostile tumor microenvironment and are associated with worse clinical outcomes in PROC. We evaluated the safety and preliminary efficacy of PY159, an agonist antibody to Triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells-1 (TREM1) that reprograms immunosuppressive intratumoral myeloid cells, and PY314, an antagonist antibody to Triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells-2 (TREM2) that depletes tumor-associated macrophages, as single agents and in combination with pembrolizumab in subjects with PROC. PY159 and PY314 were individually evaluated in patients with PROC. Patients were treated with monotherapy (PY159 3 mg/kg or PY314 10 mg/kg), based on the recommended dose for expansion derived from the phase 1a studies. At the time of first progression, patients could continue study drug and crossover to combination therapy with pembrolizumab (200 mg) every 3 weeks at the discretion of the investigator. Disease assessment by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumor version 1.1 was performed every 6 weeks. 17 patients were enrolled in the PY159 study (median age 67, range 22-77; median prior therapies 6, range 2-18) and 16 patients in PY314 (median age 65.5, range 49-81; median prior therapies 4, range 2-10). 7 patients in PY159 and 8 patients in PY314 crossed over to combination therapy. Safety events included the following: treatment-related adverse events occurred in 15 patients (88.2%) in PY159 and 9 patients (56.3%) in PY314. Infusion-related reactions occurred in 6 patients (35.3%) in PY159 and 3 patients (18.8%) in PY314.

The HAWK (NCT02207530), CONDOR (NCT02319044), and EAGLE (NCT02369874) studies evaluated R/M HNSCC treatment with durvalumab or durvalumab-tremelimumab. Tumor tissue samples pooled from HAWK/CONDOR (n = 153) and plasma cell-free DNA samples from EAGLE (n = 285) were analyzed to identify somatic alterations and association with survival. The mutational landscape was similar in tissue and plasma. Compared with the wild type, TP53 mutations were associated with significantly shorter overall survival (OS; HR; 95% confidence interval) with standard of care (SoC; EAGLE: 2.12; 1.20-3.78) and ICIs (HAWK/CONDOR: 1.49; 1.05-2.12 and EAGLE: 1.44; 0.99-2.10). In EAGLE, patients with TP53 mutations had significantly longer OS with durvalumab-tremelimumab versus SoC (P = 0.045). KMT2D mutations were associated with a trend toward longer OS (HR; 95% confidence interval) versus the wild type in HAWK/CONDOR (0.81; 0.56-1.19) and a trend toward longer OS with ICIs versus SoC in EAGLE. For both mutations, a European Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 1 was associated with worsened OS, and PD-L1 positivity was associated with improved OS. This is the first large-scale study to show the mutational landscape of R/M HNSCC and its association with clinical outcomes in patients treated with ICIs or SoC.

Data on patients' needs and treatment goals depending on the skin phenotype and disease burden are limited. This study aimed to analyse the impact of distinct phenotypes of chronic atopic pruritus on disease burden and treatment goals. Another objective was to investigate whether the disease burden influences the treatment goals. Patient-reported outcomes of 1,086 adult patients (n = 529 with atopic dermatitis, n = 557 with chronic pruritus on non-lesional skin with atopic skin diathesis) were analysed age- and gender-matched (mean age 49.7 ± 19.0 years; n = 605 female [55.7%]), comparing pruritus intensity (Numeric Rating Scale), quality of life (Dermatology Life Quality Index, ItchyQol), anxiety and depression (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale), and patient needs (Patient Needs Questionnaire of the Patient Benefit Index-Pruritus). Although the disease burden was significantly higher in patients with atopic dermatitis (prolonged disease duration, increased quality of life impairment, higher pruritus intensity), the treat-ment goals of both phenotypes matched in 92.6%. The most important needs were to no longer experience itching, find a clear diagnosis and therapy, and have confidence in the therapy.",,,svenja.mueller@ukmuenster.de.

40077603,L-Arabinose Alleviates Functional Constipation in Mice by Regulating Gut Microbiota and Metabolites.,,"Foods (Basel, Switzerland)",10.3390/foods14050900,"Functional constipation ranks among the most common disorders impacting human health, which is manifested by difficulty in defecation and a complex etiology. L-Arabinose, a pentose found naturally in fruit rinds and cereal husks, has been reported to regulate glycolipid metabolism, improve glucose homeostasis, and exhibit anti-inflammatory effects. However, the effect and precise mechanism of L-Arabinose on functional constipation remain unclear. In this study, the effect of L-Arabinose in alleviating functional constipation induced by diphenoxylate was evaluated. The model group consisted of functional constipation mice that did not receive any intervention. The positive drug group was treated with 2.0 g/kg lactulose, while the intervention group was given 0.5 g/kg, 0.75 g/kg, 1.0 g/kg, and 2.0 g/kg L-Arabinose, respectively. The data suggested that 20 days of L-Arabinose intervention could shorten the first black stool defecation time, increase fecal water content, and enhance the rate of small intestinal propulsion in mice with functional constipation induced by diphenoxylate. Additionally, L-Arabinose reversed the protein expression of functional constipation-related intestinal factors in the colon, characterized by a decrease in the expression of water channel proteins AQP3 and AQP4, as well as an increase in the expression of tight-junction proteins ZO-1, Claudin-1 and Occludin. Furthermore, L-Arabinose modulated the levels of hormones (MTL, Gas) and neurotransmitters (5-HT, VIP) related to the digestive systems of mice with constipation, resulting in elevated levels of 5-HT, MTL, and Gas and decreasing levels of VIP. Histopathological analysis also revealed that L-Arabinose intervention improved the intestinal inflammatory response. Furthermore, 16S rRNA sequencing and metabolomics of the intestinal microbiota demonstrated that L-Arabinose treatment improved both the intestinal microbiota composition and the metabolite levels. This study suggests that L-Arabinose can serve as a potential functional ingredient to promote intestinal health, enhance gastrointestinal motility and barrier function, regulate osmotic pressure, restore neurotransmitter levels, and effectively relieve functional constipation.",Hu C; Ji W,Healtang Biotech Co.,

We systematically evaluate the repeatability and reproducibility of handcrafted radiomics features (HRFs) from OCT scans of benign nevi and examine the impact of bin width (BW) selection on HRF stability. The effect of using stable features on a radiomics classification model was also assessed. In this prospective study, 20 volunteers underwent test-retest OCT imaging of 40 benign nevi, resulting in 80 scans. The repeatability and reproducibility of HRFs extracted from manually delineated regions of interest (ROIs) were assessed using concordance correlation coefficients (CCCs) across BWs ranging from 5 to 50. A unique set of stable HRFs was identified at each BW after removing highly correlated features to eliminate redundancy. These robust features were incorporated into a multiclass radiomics classifier trained to distinguish benign nevi, basal cell carcinoma (BCC), and Bowen's disease. Six stable HRFs were identified across all BWs, with a BW of 25 emerging as the optimal choice, balancing repeatability and the ability to capture meaningful textural details. Additionally, intermediate BWs (20-25) yielded 53 reproducible features. A classifier trained with six stable features achieved a 90% accuracy and AUCs of 0.96 and 0.94 for BCC and Bowen's disease, respectively, compared to a 76% accuracy and AUCs of 0.86 and 0.80 for a conventional feature selection approach. This study highlights the critical role of BW selection in enhancing HRF stability and provides a methodological framework for optimizing preprocessing in OCT radiomics. By demonstrating the integration of stable HRFs into diagnostic models, we establish OCT radiomics as a promising tool to aid non-invasive diagnosis in dermatology.",,,

While serological assays for the measurement of specific antibody levels are available, these are not quantitative in the biochemical sense. Yet, understanding humoral immune responses quantitatively on the systemic level would need a universal, complete, quantitative, comparable measurement method of antigen specific serum antibodies of selected immunoglobulin classes. Here we describe a fluorescent, dual-titration immunoassay, which provides the biochemical parameters that are both necessary and sufficient to quantitatively characterize the humoral immune response. For validation of theory, we used recombinant receptor binding domain of SARS-CoV-2 as antigen on microspot arrays and varied the concentration of both the antigen and the serum antibodies from infected persons to obtain a measurement matrix of binding data. Both titration curves were simultaneously fitted using an algorithm based on the generalized logistic function and adapted for analyzing biochemical variables of binding. We obtained equilibrium affinity constants and concentrations for distinct antibody classes. These variables reflect the quality and the effective quantity of serum antibodies, respectively.

PS is irreversibly externalized during apoptosis, where it serves as a signal for elimination by efferocytosis. PS is also reversibly and transiently externalized during cell activation such as platelet and immune cell activation. These events associated with physiological PS externalization are tightly controlled by the regulated activation of flippases and scramblases. Indeed, improper regulation of PS externalization results in thrombotic diseases such as Scott Syndrome, a defect in coagulation and thrombin production, and in the case of efferocytosis, can result in autoimmunity such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) when PS-mediated apoptosis and efferocytosis fails. The physiological regulation of PS is also perturbed in cancer and during viral infection, whereby PS becomes persistently exposed on the surface of such stressed and diseased cells, which can lead to chronic thrombosis and chronic immune evasion. In this review, we summarize evidence for the dysregulation of PS with a main focus on cancer biology and the pathogenic mechanisms for immune evasion and signaling by PS, as well as the discussion of new therapeutic strategies aimed to target externalized PS. We posit that chronic PS externalization is a universal and agnostic marker for diseased tissues, and in cancer, likely reflects a cell intrinsic form of immune escape. The continued development of new therapeutic strategies for targeting PS also provides rationale for their co-utility as adjuvants and with immune checkpoint therapeutics.",De Lorenzo MS,Department of Cell Biology and Molecular Medicine,birgera@njms.rutgers.

40057374,Toward the use of nanopore RNA sequencing technologies in the clinic: challenges and opportunities.,2025-03-08,Nucleic acids research,10.1093/nar/gkaf128,"RNA molecules have garnered increased attention as potential clinical biomarkers in recent years. While short-read sequencing and quantitative polymerase chain reaction have been the primary methods for quantifying RNA abundance, they typically fail to capture critical post-transcriptional regulatory elements, such as RNA modifications, which are often dysregulated in disease contexts. A promising cutting-edge technique sequencing method that addresses this gap is direct RNA sequencing, offered by Oxford Nanopore Technologies, which can simultaneously capture both RNA abundance and modification information. The rapid advancements in this platform, along with growing evidence of dysregulated RNA species in biofluids, presents a compelling clinical opportunity. In this review, we discuss the challenges and the emerging opportunities for the adoption of nanopore RNA sequencing technologies in the clinic, highlighting their potential to revolutionize personalized medicine and disease monitoring.",,,

Novel immune targets and technical advances are driving a rapid exploration of new treatment strategies incorporating immune agents in cancer clinical practice. Immunotherapies perturb a complex system of interactions among genomically unstable tumor cells, diverse cells within the tumor microenvironment including the systemic adaptive and innate immune cells. The drive to develop increasingly effective immunotherapy regimens is tempered by the risk of immune-related adverse events. Evidence-based biomarkers that measure the potential for therapeutic response and/or toxicity are critical to guide optimal patient care and contextualize the results of immunotherapy clinical trials. Responding to the lack of guidance on biomarker testing in early-phase immunotherapy clinical trials, we propose a definition and listing of essential biomarkers recommended for inclusion in all such protocols. These recommendations are based on consensus provided by the Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer (SITC) Clinical Immuno-Oncology Network (SCION) faculty with input from the SITC Pathology and Biomarker Committees and the Journal for ImmunoTherapy of Cancer readership. A consensus-based selection of essential biomarkers was conducted using a Delphi survey of SCION faculty. Regular updates to these recommendations are planned. The inaugural list of essential biomarkers includes complete blood count with differential to generate a neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio or systemic immune-inflammation index, serum lactate dehydrogenase and albumin, programmed death-ligand 1 immunohistochemistry, microsatellite stability assessment, and tumor mutational burden. Inclusion of these biomarkers across early-phase immunotherapy clinical trials will capture variation among trials, provide deeper insight into the novel and established therapies, and support improved patient selection and stratification for later-phase clinical trials.",Collyar D; Vos W; Diaz-Padilla I; Garrett-Mayer E; Grandi P; Simons VH; Takimoto CH,American Society of Clinical Oncology; GSK Oncology Research Unit; Adze Biotech Inc; IGM Biosciences; Prostate Net; Radiomics.bio; Patient Advocates In Research (PAIR),trc3@queensu.ca.

Analyzing the causes of this replant disease from the perspective of rhizosphere microecology is therefore essential. In this study, we examined rhizosphere soils from apple trees subjected to continuous cropping. The mechanisms underlying ARD were elucidated through high-throughput sequencing of the soil microbiome, co-occurrence network analysis using NetShift, and correlation analyses. Core bacterial microbes were isolated, and their roles in altering the microecological environment were verified through reinoculation experiments. The results indicated that the disease indices for apple seedlings cultivated increased in continuously cropped soils. Bacterial diversity decreased in continuously cropped apple orchards for 10 years (R10) and 15 years (R15), but the relative abundance of Pseudomonas increased. In contrast, fungal diversity increased, with the relative abundance of Fusarium also increasing. As a dominant genus, Pseudomonas exhibited significant network variation after 10 years of consecutive cultivation, suggesting that this microorganism may play a key role in the occurrence of ARD. Moreover, the correlation analysis revealed, for the first time, that Pseudomonas is negatively correlated with bacterial diversity but positively correlated with the relative abundance of Fusarium, indicating a close relationship between Pseudomonas and Fusarium in continuously cropped soil. Four key Pseudomonas amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) strains were isolated from the continuously cropped rhizosphere soil of apple trees, and reinoculation experiments verified that introducing Pseudomonas exacerbated the occurrence of replant diseases in both strawberry and apple, with significantly higher disease indices compared to single Fusarium inoculation.

Genomic and precision medicine,10.1161/CIRCGEN.124.004933,"Therapies targeting the LPL (lipoprotein lipase) pathway are under development for cardiometabolic disease. Insights into their efficacy-both alone and in combination with existing lipid-lowering therapies-modes of action, and safety of these agents are essential to inform clinical development. Using Mendelian randomization, we aimed to (1) evaluate efficacy, (2) explore shared mechanisms, (3) assess additive effects with approved lipid-lowering drugs, and (4) identify secondary indications and potential adverse effects. We selected triglyceride-lowering genetic variants located in the genes encoding ANGPTL3 (angiopoietin-like 3), ANGPTL4 (angiopoietin-like 4), APOC3 (apolipoprotein C3), and LPL and conducted drug target Mendelian randomization on primary outcomes including coronary artery disease and type 2 diabetes, and secondary outcomes, including apolipoprotein B, waist-to-hip ratio, body mass index, and 233 metabolic biomarkers. We conducted interaction Mendelian randomization analyses in 488 139 UK Biobank participants to test the effect of combination therapy targeting the LPL and LDLR (low-density lipoprotein receptor) pathways. Finally, we investigated potential secondary indications and adverse effects by leveraging genetic association data on 1204 disease end points. Genetically predicted triglyceride lowering through the perturbation of LPL pathway activation targets ANGPTL4, APOC3, and LPL was associated with a lower risk of coronary artery disease and type 2 diabetes and lower apolipoprotein B. Genetically predicted triglyceride lowering through ANGPTL4 was associated with a lower waist-to-hip ratio, suggestive of a favorable body fat distribution. There was no evidence of a multiplicative interaction between genetically proxied perturbation of ANGPTL4, APOC3, and LPL and that of HMGCR (HMG-CoA reductase) and PCSK9 (proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9) on coronary artery disease and type 2 diabetes, consistent with additive effects. Finally, associations of genetically predicted LPL pathway targeting were supportive of the broad safety of these targets. Our findings provide genetic evidence supporting the efficacy and safety of LPL pathway activation therapies for the prevention of coronary artery disease and type 2 diabetes, alone or in combination with statins or PCSK9 inhibitors.",Gagnon E; Gill D; Chabot D; Thériault S; Burgess S; Arsenault BJ,Sequoia Genetics; MRC Biostatistics Unit (S.

This prospective study aimed to investigate the relationship between CYP2D6 genetic polymorphisms and endoxifen plasma concentrations among Chinese patients with breast cancer treated with tamoxifen. From August 2015 to June 2018, 110 patients with breast cancer were enrolled. CYP2D6 variant alleles and endoxifen plasma concentration were determined using Sanger sequencing and high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry, respectively. The most frequent allele of CYP2D6 was *10 (56.4%). The most frequent genotype of CYP2D6 was *10/*10 (33%), *1/*10(28.2%) and *2/*10(14.5%). Sixty-four patients (58.2%) were Normal Metabolizers (NM), while 46 (41.8%) were Intermediate Metabolizers (IM). All patients except two had endoxifen concentrations above the threshold of 5.9ng/ml. The median endoxifen plasma concentrations for patients with CYP2D6 genotypes *1/*2 and *1/10 were higher compared to other genotypes (p = 0.012). The median endoxifen plasma concentration was higher in NM than in IM (18ng/ml vs. 13ng/ml, p = 0.0077). Patients with CYP2D6*10(T/T) had lower endoxifen concentrations than those with *10(C/T) and *10(C/C) but the difference was not significant. There were no significant differences in adverse events between patients in the NM and IM groups or between patients with the CYP2D6*10 (T/T) genotype and non-*10 (T/T) genotype. Only CYP2D6 IMs and NMs were identified in this study. Almost all patients had the endoxifen concentrations above the threshold. The endoxifen plasma concentration was lower in CYP2D6 IMs than in NMs, but these variants did not compromise the adverse effects of tamoxifen in Asian patients with breast cancer.

To limit their mutagenic potential, benign cells restrict LINE-1 expression through molecular mechanisms such as DNA methylation and histone modification, but these mechanisms are usually impaired in cancer. Clear cell ovarian carcinoma (CCOC) represents 5-10% of ovarian cancers and is thought to arise from endometriosis. Women with advanced CCOC face poor prognoses, highlighting the importance of understanding early disease pathogenesis. In our study, 33 of 40 cases (over 82%) of CCOC tumors express ORF1p, a LINE-1-encoded protein. We found that LINE-1 de-repression is an early event in CCOC, as ORF1p is enhanced during the transition from typical to atypical endometriosis and persists in invasive cancer. Finally, using single-molecule array (Simoa) assays, we detected ORF1p in patient blood, suggesting it as a potential minimally invasive biomarker for this disease.",,,rdrapkin@pennmedicine.upenn.edu.

Oncology,10.1016/S1470-2045(24)00648-X,"Access to many cancer medicines on WHO's Essential Medicines List (EML) is restricted because of price, especially in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs). Other cancer medicines that have been shown to improve survival, such as immune checkpoint inhibitors for lung cancer, are not included on the EML because approved doses and schedules exceed affordable prices in LMICs. Multiple strategies are therefore needed to reduce medicine costs or circumvent these problems, such as optimising doses and schedules. Cancer medicines are approved by regulatory agencies, such as the US Food and Drug Administration and the European Medicines Agency, following rigorous clinical trials. However, these approvals can involve dosing regimens and treatment schedules that, although effective in showing statistically significant benefits in trials, can be higher in intensity, frequency, or duration than is necessary to achieve meaningful improved survival. In clinical practice, these regimens can lead to concerns about balancing optimal therapeutic outcomes with the risk of side-effects, patient quality of life, and long-term health effects. Various types of evidence can, and should, be used to explore and show near-equivalence of beneficial outcomes from reduced-intensity treatments, including randomised clinical trials, dose-finding phase 1 and 2 studies, and pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic studies. The positive effects of proving that lower doses or less intensive schedules retain therapeutic activity include reduced toxicity and large price reductions, leading to better cost-effectiveness and greater access to treatments that improve survival. Beyond regulatory approvals, identification of regimens that have similar outcomes with reduced doses and less intense schedules should be a priority for clinicians and policy makers in the selection process to identify effective medicines at national and global levels.",Moja L,Health Products Policy and Standards,mojal@who.int.

Inconsistent measurement and reporting are a barrier to specific targets, resource allocation, and interventions. In this Article we report current estimates of overweight and obesity across childhood and adolescence, progress over time, and forecasts to inform specific actions. Using established methodology from the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2021, we modelled overweight and obesity across childhood and adolescence from 1990 to 2021, and then forecasted to 2050. Primary data for our models included 1321 unique measured and self-reported anthropometric data sources from 180 countries and territories from survey microdata, reports, and published literature. These data were used to estimate age-standardised global, regional, and national overweight prevalence and obesity prevalence (separately) for children and young adolescents (aged 5-14 years, typically in school and cared for by child health services) and older adolescents (aged 15-24 years, increasingly out of school and cared for by adult services) by sex for 204 countries and territories from 1990 to 2021. Prevalence estimates from 1990 to 2021 were generated using spatiotemporal Gaussian process regression models, which leveraged temporal and spatial correlation in epidemiological trends to ensure comparability of results across time and geography. Prevalence forecasts from 2022 to 2050 were generated using a generalised ensemble modelling approach assuming continuation of current trends. For every age-sex-location population across time (1990-2050), we estimated obesity (vs overweight) predominance using the log ratio of obesity percentage to overweight percentage. Between 1990 and 2021, the combined prevalence of overweight and obesity in children and adolescents doubled, and that of obesity alone tripled. By 2021, 93·1 million (95% uncertainty interval 89·6-96·6) individuals aged 5-14 years and 80·6 million (78·2-83·3) aged 15-24 years had obesity. At the super-region level in 2021, the prevalence of overweight and of obesity was highest in north Africa and the Middle East (eg, United Arab Emirates and Kuwait), and the greatest increase from 1990 to 2021 was seen in southeast Asia, east Asia, and Oceania (eg, Taiwan [province of China], Maldives, and China). By 2021, for females in both age groups, many countries in Australasia (eg, Australia) and in high-income North America (eg, Canada) had already transitioned to obesity predominance, as had males and females in a number of countries in north Africa and the Middle East (eg, United Arab Emirates and Qatar) and Oceania (eg, Cook Islands and American Samoa). From 2022 to 2050, global increases in overweight (not obesity) prevalence are forecasted to stabilise, yet the increase in the absolute proportion of the global population with obesity is forecasted to be greater than between 1990 and 2021, with substantial increases forecast between 2022 and 2030, which continue between 2031 and 2050. By 2050, super-region obesity prevalence is forecasted to remain highest in north Africa and the Middle East (eg, United Arab Emirates and Kuwait), and forecasted increases in obesity are still expected to be largest across southeast Asia, east Asia, and Oceania (eg, Timor-Leste and North Korea), but also in south Asia (eg, Nepal and Bangladesh). Compared with those aged 15-24 years, in most super-regions (except Latin America and the Caribbean and the high-income super-region) a greater proportion of those aged 5-14 years are forecasted to have obesity than overweight by 2050. Globally, 15·6% (12·7-17·2) of those aged 5-14 years are forecasted to have obesity by 2050 (186 million [141-221]), compared with 14·2% (11·4-15·7) of those aged 15-24 years (175 million [136-203]). We forecasted that by 2050, there will be more young males (aged 5-14 years) living with obesity (16·5% [13·3-18·3]) than overweight (12·9% [12·2-13·6]); while for females (aged 5-24 years) and older males (aged 15-24 years), overweight will remain more prevalent than obesity. At a regional level, the following populations are forecast to have transitioned to obesity (vs overweight) predominance before 2041-50: children and adolescents (males and females aged 5-24 years) in north Africa and the Middle East and Tropical Latin America; males aged 5-14 years in east Asia, central and southern sub-Saharan Africa, and central Latin America; females aged 5-14 years in Australasia; females aged 15-24 years in Australasia, high-income North America, and southern sub-Saharan Africa; and males aged 15-24 years in high-income North America. Both overweight and obesity increased substantially in every world region between 1990 and 2021, suggesting that current approaches to curbing increases in overweight and obesity have failed a generation of children and adolescents. Beyond 2021, overweight during childhood and adolescence is forecast to stabilise due to further increases in the population who have obesity. Increases in obesity are expected to continue for all populations in all world regions. Because substantial change is forecasted to occur between 2022 and 2030, immediate actions are needed to address this public health crisis.

Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) are essential members of the TME, the exosomes and miRNAs they secrete are crucial in tumor regulation. Our previous study showed that GRP78-induced macrophages infinitely tend to be M2-type TAMs. In this study, the exosomes of M0 and GRP78-induced macrophage were collected and co-incubated with colorectal cancer (CRC) cells. The results implied that macrophage exosomes induced by GRP78 (GRP78-exos) significantly promoted stemness and chemoresistance in CRC in vitro and in vivo. Further, the top 5 miRNAs upregulated in GRP78-exos were obtained from miRNA sequencing data. The qRT-PCR validation revealed that miR-769-5p was the most observably upregulated and could be directly transferred into CRC cells via GRP78-exos. Mechanistically, the study indicated that miR-769-5p targeted MAPK1 to regulate the cell cycle-related proteins RB1, cyclin D1, and cyclin E1. This contributes to CRC cells entering a quiescent state, which leads to the development of chemoresistance. Moreover, miR-769-5p is also expressed higher in the tissues of 5-FU-resistant CRC patients. In summary, the findings indicate a novel function of miR-769-5p as a potential marker for the diagnosis and treatment of chemotherapy resistance in CRC.",,,zlc@sxu.edu.cn.

By enhancing the uptake of hydrophilic antitumor drugs, it boosts their cytotoxic effects and has proven effective in both human and veterinary medicine through electrochemotherapy. However, this treatment requires loco-regional or even general anesthesia, as electrical pulses cause muscle contractions and pain. Several clinical studies have demonstrated that application of high frequency pulses (above 5000 Hz) and short pulse duration (under 11 μs) causes much less discomfort to patients. In order to reduce the pain associated with contractions while maintaining the effectiveness of the treatment, we have developed new protocols using a high-frequency generator that delivers electric field pulses at a pulse repetition rate up to 2 MHz, associated to a multipolar electrode. In vitro tests on colorectal cancer cells were performed to assess the efficiency of cisplatin and bleomycin in inducing cell death. The efficiency obtained after one single treatment on both cell suspensions and on 3D multicellular spheroid models were similar to the ones obtained using ESOPE (European standard operating procedures for electrochemotherapy) protocol, which is currently used in clinics. In addition, as tumor cells die in an immunogenic cell death (ICD) mode and can release danger associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), major hallmarks of ICD were evaluated following the treatment by quantifying the apoptotic cell death, caspases 3/7 activation and key DAMPs. Subsequently, pilot studies on small number of conscious cats and horses under mild sedation confirmed that these protocols did not cause any noticeable muscle contractions and resulted in either partial or complete responses.

Two cohorts of infants with febrile urinary tract infection were included. Renal involvement was defined by DMSA scans and molecular disease determinants by gene expression analysis and proteomic screens, at diagnosis and after 6 mo. Innate immune hyper-activation, systemically and locally in the urinary tract, was defined as a cytokine storm. Neutrophil degranulation and renal toxicity genes were strongly regulated, with overexpression in the APN group (first DMSA+). Adaptive immune attenuation in the APN group further supported the notion of an immune imbalance. DNA exome genotyping identified APN and febrile urinary tract infection as genetically distinct and scarring associated genes, but the activation of renal toxicity genes during acute infection was unrelated to the development of renal scarring. The results define APN as a hyper-inflammatory disorder with the characteristics of a cytokine storm combined with adaptive immune attenuation. The findings are consistent with innate immune dysfunctions and neutrophil disorders identified as determinants of APN susceptibility in genetic models.",Lee B,Singapore Immunology Network,catharina.svanborg@med.lu.se.

However, many patients do not achieve complete remission with these treatments, develop resistance, and eventually experience disease relapse. New immunomodulatory treatments, such as T cell-based therapies, show promise in treating various types of blood cancers, including B cell malignancies. However, their effectiveness is often limited by the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment and altered function of patient-derived T cells. Ibrutinib, a Bruton tyrosine kinase inhibitor, has been shown to restore immune balance and function in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Ibrutinib is being studied as adjuvant or combinatorial therapy with chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells or T cell-engaging bispecific antibodies for the treatment of B cell malignancies. Current evidence suggests that ibrutinib could be beneficial when used before, during, or after CAR T cell administration, potentially providing higher complete response rates and reduced toxicity. In conclusion, existing evidence strongly supports the combined use of ibrutinib and T cell therapies. However, additional clinical trials are needed to further validate the effectiveness of this treatment strategy in patients with various B cell malignancies.",Bokun A,Janssen Biotech,abokun@its.jnj.com.

We present the results of a North American study evaluating BE and meta-analysis of literature. A prospective, blinded, multicenter study was conducted in North America. Voided urine was collected from NMIBC patients prior to cystoscopic surveillance. BE testing was performed centrally. For the meta-analysis, a PUBMED search was performed to identify all published peer-reviewed clinical studies of BE for NMIBC surveillance. In this study, 674 patients were enrolled of which 449 were included. Overall sensitivity was 67% (95%CI 58%-74%), specificity was 84% (80%-88%), PPV was 65% (57%-73%) and NPV was 85% (81%-89%). For high-grade (HG) recurrence, sensitivity was 77% (65%-85%) and NPV was 95% (92%-97%).In patients with negative cystoscopy and cytology at the first study visit, risk of subsequent recurrence in 12 months was 5.3 (2.7-10.3) times higher in patients with positive BE vs. negative BE (p < 0.0001). In patients with negative cystoscopy and equivocal cytology, BE was positive in 75-89% of those with later HG recurrence, with PPV of 42% (15%-72%)-63% (38%-84%).The meta-analysis included 7 studies and 1564 patients. Overall sensitivity was 82% (66-92%), HG sensitivity was 91% (82-95%), specificity was 85% (80-88%), PPV was 60% (55-64%) and HG NPV was 98% (97-99%). The consistently strong performance of BE indicate that a positive test could improve timely disease recurrence detection and a negative test could rule-out HG disease.

We employed a cross-disciplinary approach to identify potential treatments for metabolic dysfunction associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) using humans as a model organism. We identified 212 putative causal genes associated with MASLD using data from a large multi-ancestry genetic association study, of which 158 (74.5%) are novel. From this set we identified 57 genes that encode for druggable protein targets, and where the effects of increasing genetically predicted gene expression on MASLD risk align with the function of that drug on the protein target. These potential targets were then evaluated for evidence of efficacy using Mendelian randomization, pathway analysis, and protein structural modeling.

Such prognostic tools are lacking in psychiatry, where assessments typically emphasize immediate suicidality while neglecting long-term mortality risks, and their clinical use is debated. We evaluated the recently developed machine learning model MIRACLE-FEP, initially developed for first-episode psychosis, in predicting all-cause mortality in patients with first-episode bipolar disorder (FEBD), hypothesizing that it would provide accurate risk prediction and guide pharmacotherapy decisions. We utilized national register-based cohorts of FEBD patients from Sweden (N = 31,013, followed 2006-2021) and Finland (N = 13,956, followed 1996-2018). We assessed the MIRACLE-FEP model's performance in predicting all-cause mortality using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC), calibration, and decision curve analysis. Additionally, we conducted a pharmacoepidemiologic analysis to examine the relationship between predicted mortality risk and pharmacotherapy effectiveness. MIRACLE-FEP achieved an AUROC = 0.77 (95%CI = 0.73-0.80) for 2-year mortality prediction in Sweden and 0.71 (95%CI = 0.67-0.75) in Finland. For 10-year all-cause mortality prediction, the model demonstrated an AUROC of 0.71 in both cohorts. The model demonstrated relatively good calibration and indicated potential clinical utility in decision curve analysis. Among patients with predicted risk exceeding the observed two-year mortality rate in FEBD, the lowest mortality risk was observed with polytherapy regimens (compared to non-use of antipsychotics or mood stabilizers), including quetiapine and lamotrigine (HR = 0.42, 95%CI = 0.23-0.80) or mood stabilizer polytherapy (HR = 0.47, 95%CI = 0.27-0.82). Conversely, in patients with predicted risk below this threshold, complex pharmacotherapy was not associated with a significant reduction in mortality risk. MIRACLE-FEP offers a promising approach to predicting long-term mortality risk and could guide proactive treatment decisions, such as targeting combination pharmacotherapy, in FEBD.

Among these, GP IIb/IIIa is the primary fibrinogen receptor and is essential for platelet aggregation. Its deficiency or dysfunction impairs platelet aggregation, leading to Glanzmann thrombasthenia, a rare autosomal recessive bleeding disorder. In contrast, platelet GP IV (CD36) has a limited role in primary hemostasis. While also rare, CD36 deficiency has a disproportionately higher prevalence in individuals of East Asian, African, and Arabian descent. Patients with platelet GP deficiencies can develop antibodies against the missing GPs, leading to immune-mediated platelet transfusion refractoriness (PTR). Consequently, they are unresponsive to platelet transfusions when mostly needed. Here we present the case of an Egyptian male with a lifelong history of an incompletely characterized bleeding disorder who presented for pre-surgical evaluation. We diagnosed the patient with Type I Glanzmann thrombasthenia. Further evaluation revealed anti-CD36 antibodies, leading to the discovery of a concurrent platelet CD36 deficiency. The dual GP deficiency significantly complicated his management, as finding crossmatch-compatible platelets was challenging due to the rarity of CD36-deficient blood donors in the United States. Awareness of coexisting platelet disorders and their ramifications is limited, mostly because these are stochastically rare (~1 in 100 million for the present case). This case highlights the importance of thoroughly evaluating platelet glycoprotein deficiencies, particularly in individuals with severe bleeding disorders and from ethnic backgrounds with a predisposition to specific platelet disorders. Such an approach can prevent future platelet antibody formation or reduce bleeding risk with pre-existing antibodies.",Curtis BR; Sullivan MJ; Trapp-Stamborski V,Platelet and Neutrophil Immunology and Hematology Genetics Labs,

Until recently GIP had not been developed as a therapeutic and thus has been overshadowed by the other incretin, glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1), which is the basis for several successful drugs to treat diabetes and obesity. However, there has been a rekindling of interest in GIP biology in recent years, in great part due to pharmacology demonstrating that both GIPR agonism and antagonism may be beneficial in treating obesity and diabetes. This apparent paradox has reinvigorated the field, led to new lines of investigation, and deeper understanding of GIP. In this review, we provide a detailed overview on the multifaceted nature of GIP biology and discuss the therapeutic implications of GIPR signal modification on various diseases. Following its classification as an incretin hormone, GIP has emerged as a pleiotropic hormone with a variety of metabolic effects outside the endocrine pancreas. The numerous beneficial effects of GIPR signal modification render the peptide an interesting candidate for the development of pharmacotherapies to treat obesity, diabetes, drug-induced nausea and both bone and neurodegenerative disorders.",Coghlan MP; Finan B; Gimeno RE; Hölscher C; Mabilleau G; Samms RJ; Sloop KW,Neurodegeneration Research Group; Lilly Research Laboratories; Univ Angers,timo.mueller@helmholtz-muenchen.de.

We developed a computational target discovery platform to enable examination of both cancer and immune cells so as to identify pathways that restrain tumor progression and potentiate anti-tumor immunity. Immune-related CRISPR screen analyzer of functional targets (ICRAFT) integrates immune-related CRISPR screen datasets, single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data, and pre-treatment RNA-seq data from clinical trials, enabling a systems-level approach to therapeutic target discovery. Using ICRAFT, we identified numerous targets that enhance both cancer cell susceptibility to immune attack and T cell activation, including tumor necrosis factor (TNF) alpha-induced protein 3 (TNFAIP3), protein tyrosine phosphatase non-receptor type 2 (PTPN2), and suppressor of cytokine signaling 1 (SOCS1). In cancer cells, Tnfaip3 (A20) deletion activated the TNF-nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-κB) pathway, promoting chemokine expression and T cell recruitment to the tumor. T cell-mediated elimination of Tnaifp3-null cancer cells was primarily driven by TNF-induced apoptosis. Inactivation of Tnfaip3 in T cells enhanced anti-tumor efficacy.

40019616,The Cardiovascular Safety of Tumour Necrosis Factor Inhibitors in Arthritic Conditions: A Structured Review with Recommendations.,,Rheumatology and therapy,10.1007/s40744-025-00753-x,"There is accumulating evidence that inflammation is a key driver of atherosclerosis development and thrombotic complications. This pathophysiological mechanism explains, at least in part, the increased cardiovascular risk of patients with immune-mediated arthritis. Experimental and clinical studies have shown that tumour necrosis factor (TNF) plays a pathological role in both vascular and joint diseases, suggesting that TNF inhibitors (TNFis) may limit cardiovascular events in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), psoriatic arthritis (PsA) or spondyloarthritis (SpA). This review summarizes studies exploring the effects of TNFis on cardiovascular outcomes in patients with RA, PsA or SpA. Clinical studies suggest that TNFis reduce vascular inflammation and may improve (or prevent worsening of) endothelial dysfunction and arterial stiffness. There is evidence that TNFis reduce the incidence of cardiovascular events in patients with inflammatory arthritis compared with non-biological treatments, particularly in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Fewer studies have compared the effects of different classes of biological therapy on outcomes, but found no significant difference in the risk of cardiovascular events between patients taking TNFis and other biological therapy. In contrast, patients at high cardiovascular risk may derive greater benefit from a TNFi than from a Janus kinase inhibitor (JAKi). The cardiovascular impact of JAKis is still under debate, with a recent safety warning. Targeted control of inflammation is a key strategy to reduce the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events in patients with inflammatory arthritis. Cardiovascular evaluation and risk stratification, using a multidisciplinary approach involving rheumatology and cardiology teams, are recommended to guide optimal immunomodulatory treatment. Inflammation in blood vessel walls can lead to serious cardiovascular conditions, such as heart attacks, strokes or sudden death. Excess inflammation in autoimmune arthritic conditions like rheumatoid arthritis (RA), psoriatic arthritis (PsA) and spondyloarthritis (SpA) places people with these conditions at high risk of developing cardiovascular disease (CVD). Treatments for inflammatory arthritis suppress inflammation, so they may also reduce the risk of CVD. Potent anti-inflammatory drugs called biologicals (injected into the blood vessels [intravenous] or beneath the skin [subcutaneous]) are used when conventional drugs cannot control symptoms. This review evaluates research into the effects of biologicals called tumour necrosis factor inhibitors (TNFis) on CVD in people with RA, PsA or SpA. TNFis suppress some of the changes to the structure and function of blood vessels that can lead to CVD. TNFis also reduce the incidence of cardiovascular events in people with inflammatory arthritis compared with non-biological treatments, particularly in people with RA. Less is known about whether TNFis reduce the risk of CVD compared with other types of biological treatment or Janus kinase inhibitors (JAKis), but people at high cardiovascular risk may derive greater benefit from a TNFi than a JAKi. Assessing and managing cardiovascular risk is important when caring for people with inflammatory arthritis. Effective control of inflammation relieves arthritic symptoms and reduces the CVD risk. People with inflammatory arthritis and CVD may also need treatment for other cardiovascular risk factors (e.g. high blood pressure or cholesterol), requiring effective communication between different healthcare providers (e.g. rheumatologists and cardiologists).",Avouac J; Habauzit C; Benkhalifa S,Celltrion Healthcare France S.A.S.; Service de Rhumatologie,jerome.avouac@aphp.fr.

While immune checkpoint inhibitor therapies have transformed outcomes in many tumor types, particularly when used neoadjuvantly or as a first-line treatment, including in melanoma brain metastases, they have shown limited efficacy in patients with resected or recurrent GBM. The lack of efficacy has been attributed to the scarcity of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment and low tumor mutation burden typical of GBM tumors, plus exclusion of large molecules from the brain parenchyma. We hypothesized that upfront neoadjuvant combination immunotherapy, administered with disease in situ, could induce a stronger immune response than treatment given after resection or after recurrence. Here, we present a case of newly diagnosed IDH-wild-type, MGMT promoter unmethylated GBM, treated with a single dose of neoadjuvant triplet immunotherapy (anti-programmed cell death protein 1 plus anti-cytotoxic T-lymphocyte protein 4 plus anti-lymphocyte-activation gene 3) followed by maximal safe resection 12 days later. The anti-programmed cell death protein 1 drug was bound to TILs in the resected GBM and there was marked TIL infiltration and activation compared with the baseline biopsy. After 17 months, there is no definitive sign of recurrence. If used first line, before safe maximal resection, checkpoint inhibitors are capable of immune activation in GBM and may induce a response. A clinical trial of first-line neoadjuvant combination checkpoint inhibitor therapy in newly diagnosed GBM is planned (GIANT; trial registration no.

The primary efficacy outcomes were symptomatic COVID-19 caused by any variant or symptomatic COVID-19 caused by non-Phe456Leu-containing variants within 181 days of dosing, assessed in the SARS-CoV-2-negative set, comprising all participants without a positive RT-PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 at baseline and who received at least one trial intervention dose. Safety outcomes for adverse events were assessed 90 days following the first dose and for serious adverse events throughout the study in the safety analysis set (ie, all participants who received at least one injection of sipavibart or comparator). This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT05648110. Participants were screened from March 31 to Oct 27, 2023; 3349 participants (56·8% female) were randomly assigned: 1674 to the sipavibart group (five no first dose; 1669 sipavibart) and 1675 to the comparator group (nine no first dose; 1105 tixagevimab-cilgavimab and 561 placebo). Within 181 days of dosing, 122 (7·4%) of 1649 participants in the sipavibart group and 178 (10·9%) of 1631 participants in the comparator group had symptomatic COVID-19 due to any variant (relative risk reduction [RRR] 34·9% [97·5% CI 15·0 to 50·1]; p=0·0006), 54 (3·3%) participants in the sipavibart group and 90 (5·5%) participants in the comparator group had symptomatic COVID-19 due to non-Phe456Leu-containing variants (RRR 42·9% [95% CI 19·9 to 59·3]; p=0·0012), and 47 (2·9%) participants in the sipavibart group and 64 (3·9%) participants in the comparator group had symptomatic COVID-19 due to Phe456Leu-containing variants (30·4% [-1·8 to 52·5]). Adverse events occurred in 833 (49·9%) of 1671 participants in the sipavibart group and 857 (51·5%) of 1663 participants in the comparator group within 3 months of the first dose. One COVID-19-related death occurred in the comparator group. Serious adverse events considered related to trial intervention occurred in two (0·1%) of 1671 participants in the sipavibart group and seven (0·4%) of 1663 participants in the comparator group (none fatal). No serious cardiovascular or thrombotic events were considered to be related to sipavibart. The primary analysis showed efficacy and safety of sipavibart in preventing symptomatic COVID-19 in participants who are immunocompromised when susceptible (ie, non-Phe456Leu-containing) variants dominated, although no efficacy was shown against resistant (ie, Phe456Leu-containing) variants that dominate as of November, 2024.

The isolation and processing protocols for SVF have evolved substantially, particularly after its classification as an Advanced Therapy Medicinal Product (ATMP), which mandates adherence to Good Manufacturing Practices to ensure sterility and product quality. Despite the progress, few studies over the last decade have focused on the standardization of SVF processing. Recent advances, driven by the potential of SVF and its derived products such as Adipose-derived Stem Cells, have prompted the development of improved isolation strategies aimed at enhancing their therapeutic and regenerative efficacy. Notable progress includes the advent of automated processing systems, which reduce technical errors, minimize variability, and improve reproducibility across laboratories.

However, the precise molecular mechanisms underlying this positive effect have remained elusive. In this study, we used an azoxymethane-induced mouse model of colon carcinogenesis to identify aspirin-associated molecular alterations that could account for its cancer-preventive effect. Transcriptomic analysis of aspirin-treated mice showed a strong reduction in c-Myc protein levels and effects on the Myc-dependent transcriptional program in colonic cells. Proto-oncogene c-Myc cooperates with AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) to control cellular energetics. Here, we show that salicylate, the active metabolite of aspirin, reduces c-Myc protein expression levels through multiple mechanisms that are both AMPK dependent and independent. This effect is cell-type dependent and occurs at both the transcriptional and post-translational levels. Salicylate-induced AMPK activation leads to the phosphorylation of c-Myc at Thr400, as well as its destabilization and degradation. Our results reveal a complex, multilayered, negative effect of salicylate on c-Myc protein abundance and suggest that chronic depletion of c-Myc can counteract the neoplastic transformation of colorectal epithelium, underpinning the preventive effect of aspirin on colorectal cancer.",,,

Initially approved for late line MM (>4 prior lines), these were recently approved for use in MM with 1-2 prior lines of therapy in April 2024. As their use outside of the pivotal clinical trials continues to expand, it is important to critically evaluate the safety and efficacy of these therapies. Further, it is important to identify patients that would be most likely to benefit from the use of CAR T in earlier lines of therapy. Cilta-cel was initially studied in the phase-I LEGEND-2 study, followed by CARTITUDE-1 and CARTITUDE-4 trials, demonstrating remarkable efficacy. A recent large real-world study also demonstrated similar efficacy, in a mostly pivotal trial ineligible patient population. Based on these impressive results, cilta-cel is currently being studied in trials for newly diagnosed as well as smoldering multiple myeloma. Cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and immune effector cell associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS) are known toxicities of cilta-cel (and other CAR Ts), however movement and cognitive disorders (delayed neurotoxicity) and second primary malignancies are an evolving concern. In this article we discuss safety and efficacy data from existing cilta-cel studies. We propose that all patients with MM who have received ≥4 prior lines of therapy should be considered for CAR T. Earlier line use of CAR T should be restricted to patients with a high-risk disease phenotype (eg, functional high-risk disease). This disease phenotype has historically shown poor outcomes with standard triplet regimens and would be most likely to benefit from earlier use of CAR T: considering the availability of other safe and highly effective therapies, and potential high-risk toxicities of CAR T.",Goel U; Zanwar S,Department of Internal Medicine; Division of Hematology,

The resulting SVD-based tau and Aβ scores as well as the APOE ε4 genotype, were entered as predictors in a voxelwise general linear model for statistical assessment of their effect on FDG. We found cortical regions where a reduced glucose metabolism was maximally correlated with distributed patterns of tau, accounting for the effect of Aβ and APOE ε4 genotype.

Previous genomic evidence identified four ACs potentially linked to depression risk. We carried forward these ACs and tested the association of their circulating levels with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) diagnosis, overall depression severity and specific symptom profiles. The sample from the Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety included participants with current (n = 1035) or remitted (n = 739) MDD and healthy controls (n = 800). Plasma levels of four ACs (short-chain: acetylcarnitine C2 and propionylcarnitine C3; medium-chain: octanoylcarnitine C8 and decanoylcarnitine C10) were measured. Overall depression severity as well as atypical/energy-related (AES), anhedonic and melancholic symptom profiles were derived from the Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology. As compared to healthy controls, subjects with current or remitted MDD presented similarly lower mean C2 levels (Cohen's d = 0.2, p ≤ 1e-4). Higher overall depression severity was significantly associated with higher C3 levels (ß = 0.06, SE = 0.02, p = 1.21e-3). No associations were found for C8 and C10.

Results were confirmed in analyses pooling data with an additional internal replication sample from the same subjects measured at 6-year follow-up (totaling 4141 observations).

Participants with preclinical AD (community-based only) were more likely to fulfill SCD-plus features. The presence of self-reported memory decline, associated concern/worry, and a higher number of fulfilled features were all associated with high Aβ levels. Only the latter was associated with abnormal tau. Simultaneous endorsement of multiple SCD-plus features is a robust indicator of abnormal AD biomarkers in CU older adults, whereas isolated SCD features seem only sensitive to elevated Aβ, supporting their value as early behavioral markers of preclinical AD. About two-tenths of our sample had abnormal amyloid beta (Aβ) levels with evidence of subjective cognitive decline (SCD). Preclinical AD subsamples (community-based) had a higher percentage of participants meeting SCD-plus features. Self-reported memory decline and concern/worry were the sole features associated with high Aβ, but not tau, burden. A higher number of fulfilled SCD-plus features are linked to high Aβ and tau burden. Use of multiple SCD-plus features may help identify early stages of biological AD.",Chételat G; Butterbrod E; ; ; ; ,Department of Clinical; ; Normandie Univ,

RG6292 is an anti-CD25 antibody that preferentially depletes Tregs while preserving effector T-cell functions in preclinical models. The safety, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and antitumor efficacy of selective Treg depletion by RG6292 administered as monotherapy or in combination with atezolizumab were evaluated in two phase I studies. Adult patients with advanced solid tumors were administered intravenous RG6292, given every 3 weeks alone (study 1: NCT04158583, n = 76) or with 1,200 mg atezolizumab every 3 weeks (study 2: NCT04642365, n = 49). Both studies included dose escalation and expansion parts to determine the maximum tolerated dose and recommended phase II dose. RG6292 was well tolerated. Pruritus and rash were the most frequent adverse events and were manageable with supportive treatment. Serum RG6292 levels increased dose proportionally, independent of the atezolizumab combination. RG6292 induced a sustained dose-dependent depletion of peripheral Tregs with no apparent effect on other immune cells. Evidence of intratumoral Treg reduction (≥50% vs. baseline) was observed at RG6292 doses of 35 to 100 mg. The maximum tolerated dose was 165 mg every 3 weeks, and the recommended phase II dose was proposed as 70 mg every 3 weeks. Objective responses were limited to three partial responses in patients receiving RG6292 combined with atezolizumab. RG6292 induced a dose-dependent peripheral blood and measurable intratumoral Treg depletion in concordance with the proposed mode of action; however, clinical efficacy as a single agent or combined with atezolizumab was insufficient to warrant further exploration in this population. RG6292 (vopikitug) targets CD25 (IL-2Rα) and mediates regulatory T-cell depletion while not interfering with IL-2 signaling. Peripheral and intratumoral Treg depletion was shown in two phase I studies.

However, a significant percentage of patients experience pouch failure, leading to morbidity. This retrospective case-control study identified histopathological features of the TAC specimen associated with pouch failure and investigated the molecular mechanisms of this susceptibility using single-cell spatial transcriptomics. We analyzed a cohort of 417 patients who underwent IPAA between 2000-2010 at the University of Chicago Medical Center for up to 18 years. Histological examination of TAC specimens focused on disease activity, depth of inflammation, and specific features, including granulomas and deep ulcers. A subset of patients was profiled using single-cell spatial transcriptomics to map gene expression and immune cell interactions in relation to the risk of pouch failure. The 18-year pouch failure risk was 23%, with post-procedure diagnosis of CD as a major risk factor (HR = 4.3, 95% CI: 2.3-8.1) as well as high-risk histologic features, including deep chronic inflammation (HR = 21, 95% CI: 11-41) and severe disease activity (HR = 14, 95% CI: 5.7-32) in TAC specimens. Spatial transcriptomics showed immune infiltration of T and myeloid cells, reduced myocyte-glial interactions, and cytokine signaling pathways such as IL-10, IL-1β, and type I/II interferons, associated with an increased risk of pouch failure. Histological features and spatial molecular profiling are predictive of IPAA failure. These findings support the use of histologic evaluation and targeted molecular analysis of the TAC specimen to identify high-risk patients and improve IPAA outcomes.",,,

Here, a vascular microphysiological system (MPS) is introduced as a testbed to investigate the combinational effect of thermal and fluid perturbations (i.e., wall shear stress) on human endothelial barrier function. Two methods of organ storage are compared: isochoric supercooling (ISC) preservation, which prevents ice formation at subzero temperatures; and, the standard clinical protocol of static cold storage (SCS) at 4 °C. Integrating electrical impedance measurements on chip allow real-time monitoring and quantification of barrier function during preservation and reperfusion protocols. Isochoric supercooling preservation enables longer periods of preservation with superior recovery of barrier function during reperfusion, and has lower metabolic activities compared to static cold storage. Genomic analysis reveals injury and recovery mechanisms at the molecular level for the different preservation and reperfusion conditions. The multifunctional vascular microphysiological system provides a physiologically relevant in vitro model recapitulating ischemia-reperfusion injury to the endothelium.

The high transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2, a lack of population immunity, and the prevalence of severe clinical outcomes created a need for the rapid development of effective therapeutic countermeasures. Sybodies, or synthetic nanobodies, are a novel and unique class of synthetic antigen-binding fragments ideal for large-scale production. We created a neutralizing sybody directed against the receptor-binding domain (RBD) epitope of the Spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 and conjugated it to remdesivir to create nanobody-drug-conjugate (NDC). We used a mouse model of infection to determine the capacity of the NDC to reduce disease severity and mortality. K18-hACE2 mice treated with NDC prior to, simultaneously with, and/or post-SARS-CoV-2 infection had reduced weight loss, mortality, lung pathology, and viral RNA in their lungs. This protection was found to be dependent on the protein structure of the sybody.

The aim of this study is to assess optimal itch response onset and long-term maintenance using treat-to-target criteria in dupilumab-treated patients. This post hoc analysis assessed patients ≥ 18 years with moderate-to-severe AD in two phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies. Patients received dupilumab 300 mg every 2 weeks or placebo with concomitant topical corticosteroids (TCS) for 52 weeks (CHRONOS); or dupilumab monotherapy 300 mg every week/every 2 weeks/every 4 weeks/every 8 weeks or placebo for 36 weeks after achieving Eczema Area and Severity Index improvement of 75% or Investigator's Global Assessment 0/1 with dupilumab in SOLO1/2 (SOLO-CONTINUE). Optimal itch response was defined as Peak Pruritus Numeric Rating Scale ≤ 4. Patients receiving dupilumab + TCS achieved optimal itch response faster and in higher proportion than those receiving placebo + TCS (P < 0.0001) and maintained optimal response longer (median [Q1-Q3] 40 [11-50] vs 3 [0-23] weeks; P < 0.0001). Patients achieving optimal itch response with dupilumab monotherapy who continued treatment maintained response longer compared with those transitioned to placebo, although duration decreased with less frequent dosing (P < 0.0001 for all dupilumab regimens vs placebo). Optimal itch response was achieved rapidly and maintained long term in adult patients treated with dupilumab with or without concomitant TCS therapy. NCT02395133 and NCT02260986. Atopic dermatitis (AD), the most common skin disorder, presents mainly with skin lesions that can be intensely itchy. Itch deeply impacts patients with AD and their quality of life; scratching due to itching can also worsen the lesions. An increasing number of “systemic therapies” (working through the whole body as opposed to, for example, treatments applied on the skin) have recently been approved for the treatment of AD. To help physicians decide between systemic treatment options, a guidance called “treat-to-target concept” defines specific treatment goals to be reached within a certain time, including specific improvements in itch. In this work, we analyzed itch improvement in patients with moderate-to-severe AD treated with the systemic therapy dupilumab. Patients treated with dupilumab achieved the intended itch improvement significantly faster compared to those receiving placebo (a saline solution without active treatment). Most importantly, patients treated with dupilumab maintained this improvement significantly longer than those receiving placebo. When patients who had achieved improvement in AD signs and symptoms (including itch) were assigned to continue dupilumab (in the same dose or less frequently) or placebo, those patients continuing dupilumab maintained itch improvement significantly longer than those switched to placebo, although the duration of improvement decreased in those receiving dupilumab less frequently. It should be noted that these analyses were decided upon and performed only after the data became available (“post hoc analyses”), which is a limitation. In conclusion, patients with AD treated with dupilumab achieved improvement of their itch rapidly, and this improvement was maintained long term.",Chen Z; Hagen S; Bastian M,Regeneron GmbH; Sanofi; Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc.,Mike.Bastian@sanofi.com.

However, the 'stroke paradox' refers to the observation that stroke patients who smoke often have higher survival rates and better outcomes compared to non-smokers. In this sense, several studies have demonstrated that nicotine (3-[(2S)-1-methylpyrrolidin-2-yl]pyridine) exerts neuroprotective effects. Despite this, the molecular underpinnings of this phenomenon remain unclear. AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is known to play a complex and controversial role in ischemic stroke, with recent evidence suggesting that AMPK inhibition has neuroprotective effects in acute ischemic injury. Nicotine has been shown to influence AMPK signaling in the brain, suppressing appetite and promoting brown fat thermogenesis via hypothalamic AMPK inhibition. Therefore, we hypothesized that the neuroprotective effect of nicotine in ischemia is due to its inhibitory action on AMPK. The aim of this study has been to investigate whether i) AMPK is involved in nicotine's neuroprotective effects on cerebral ischemia and ii) small extracellular vesicle (sEV)-mediated genetic inhibition of AMPK could replicate this effect in rodent models. Male adult mice or rats subjected to transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO) were compared with Sham and/or untreated controls groups. The stroke-induced lesion was evaluated by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Nicotine (2 mg/kg/12 h) and the AMPK activator AICAR (500 mg/kg/day) were given subcutaneously upon reperfusion until the end of the follow-up period to tMCAO rats. Control sEVs or sEVs loaded with a plasmid encoding a dominant negative isoform of AMPKα2 (AMPKα2-DN) were administered intravenously twice after reperfusion to tMCAO mice. Molecular pathways were analyzed by western blotting. Bederson and open-field tests were applied to evaluate behavioral parameters. Our MRI findings indicated that nicotine treatment reduced brain ischemic injury and improved neurological recovery, as demonstrated by Bederson test, through the inhibition of brain AMPK in ischemic rats. The AMPK activator AICAR reversed the effect of nicotine on injury size and neurological improvement, indicating that the neuroprotective action was dependent on AMPK inhibition. In addition, treatment with AMPKα2-DN sEVs reduced brain lesion and improved neurological recovery. Our findings demonstrate that the regulation of brain AMPK provides an adequate neuroprotective target for cerebral ischemia, and that the sEV-mediated regulation of this kinase could be a potential clinical strategy against ischemic stroke. Further work, involving scalability in sEV production, immunogenicity, safety and efficacy will be demanding to develop effective and secure therapeutic strategies utilizing sEVs in clinical settings against ischemic stroke.",,,tomas.sobrino.moreiras@sergas.es.

We did a prespecified secondary analysis of the SCORED trial, which was a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomised clinical trial enrolling patients (aged ≥18 years) with type 2 diabetes, chronic kidney disease (estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] 25-60 mL/min per 1·73 m 10 584 patients were enrolled and randomly assigned to sotagliflozin (n=5292 [50·0%]) or placebo (n=5292 [50·0%]) between Dec 8, 2017 and Jan 20, 2020 (median age 69 years [IQR 63-74]; 4754 [44·9%] female patients and 5830 [55·1%] male patients). 5144 (48·6%) patients had a history of cardiovascular disease, of whom 2108 (19·9% of the total population) had a history of myocardial infarction, 946 (8·9%) had a history of stroke, and 2375 (22·4%) had a history of coronary revascularisation. Patients in the sotagliflozin group had a significantly lower rate of total MACE than those in the placebo group (4·8 events per 100 person-years vs 6·3 events per 100 person-years; hazard ratio [HR] 0·77 [95% CI 0·65-0·91]; p=0·0020). Interaction analyses suggested a consistent effect of sotagliflozin on total MACE among stratified subgroups without evidence of heterogeneity. Additionally, sotagliflozin significantly reduced the rate of myocardial infarction (1·8 events per 100 person-years vs 2·7 events per 100 person-years; HR 0·68 [0·52-0·89]; p=0·0041) and stroke (1·2 events per 100 person-years vs 1·8 events per 100 person-years; HR 0·66 [0·48-0·91]; p=0·012) compared with placebo. Sotagliflozin reduced MACE, with independent reductions in myocardial infarction and stroke, among patients with type 2 diabetes, chronic kidney disease, and additional cardiovascular risk. The ischaemic benefit on both myocardial infarction and stroke has not been previously observed with other SGLT inhibitors and warrants investigation of combined SGLT1 and SGLT2 inhibition as a possible underlying mechanism.

Moreover, concerns regarding scalability led to the concurrent development of a high-throughput human in vitro senescence cartilage organoid model. Osteochondral explants and cells for the cartilage organoid model were isolated from patients undergoing joint replacement surgery due to OA. To induce senescence, explants and organoids were subjected to radiation and/or mechanical loading. Samples were harvested; gene expression of relevant senescent and cartilage genes was measured using RT-qPCR, and protein expression was evaluated using histology. A general senescence phenotype was induced by the perturbations, as shown by senescence-associated β-galactosidase staining. In-depth gene expression analysis revealed that hyperphysiological mechanical loading upregulated gene expression of IL8 and SERPINE1, representing aspects of a senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) profile. Irradiation upregulated CDKN1A, encoding p21, and downregulated LMNB1, representing a cell cycle arrest profile with the absence of a SASP response. Combining the two perturbations showed upregulation of CDKN1A, IL8, and SERPINE and downregulation of LMNB1, representing a complementary senescence model. The high-throughput human in vitro cartilage organoid senescence model showed similar effects to the irradiation explant model. In this study, we present a variety of senescence models of human aged chondrocytes that allows for rapid initial screening of anti-senescence compounds in high-throughput, as well as in-depth, characterization of post-mitotic aged chondrocytes prone to OA pathophysiology. This research advances the development of essential therapeutics for OA.",,,

TLR9 agonists, such as lefitolimod (MGN1703), significantly increased Th1 response in preclinical models and have demonstrated efficacy in early clinical trials. This trial assessed the safety and preliminary efficacy of the combination of lefitolimod and ipilimumab in patients with advanced solid tumors. This was a single-center, open-label, investigator-initiated phase I trial conducted at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center. Patients received leftolimod either subcutaneously (at escalating doses of 15-120 mg) or intratumorally (at the maximum feasible dose) in combination with ipilimumab (3 mg/kg). Paired biopsy samples were collected before the start of treatment and after two treatment cycles and analyzed by flow cytometry. We enrolled a total of 28 patients in this study with a median age of 56 years (range 19-75) in the escalation cohort and 60 years (range 34 -92) in the expansion cohort. The median number of prior lines of therapy was 4 (range 0-12). Eleven patients had at least one treatment-related adverse event (TRAE). The most common TRAEs were skin rash ( The combination of lefitolimod (administered subcutaneously or intratumorally) and ipilimumab was safe and well tolerated but demonstrated modest antitumor activity in patients with advanced cancers.

Jeffrey ex Lu & Zhang, a popular herb in traditional Chinese materials, has been broadly employed in food and medicine homology. According to TCM, S. grosvenorii is an essential medicine for clearing the throat and relieving the lungs (Qingyanlifei). However, the bioactive effects of S. grosvenorii on pharyngitis targets remain unclear. To determine the active compounds, prospective targets, and the associated molecular mechanisms of S. grosvenorii acts healing pharyngitis. The present study integrated network pharmacology, bioinformatics, molecular docking strategies, and in vitro verification for analysis. The active components and potential targets of S. grosvenorii and pharyngitis-related disease targets were sourced from open databases available to the public using network pharmacology approach. The key active components, anti-pharyngitis core targets and pathways were predicted to be obtained by PPI network, GO and KEGG pathway enrichment and bioinformatics analysis. Afterward, molecular docking was executed to estimate the binding interactions of the active constituents with the primary targets. Finally, the key targets predicted via network pharmacology were retrieved from the HPA database, WGCNA, and in vitro trials were performed to further substantiate the outcomes. A total of 23 bioactive components in S. grosvenorii and 568 herb targets were screened, producing 82 mutual targets in combination with 756 disease targets. GO enrichment analysis incorporated 1708 BP, 49 CC, and 91 MF. KEGG enrichment analysis indicated that the anti-inflammatory effect of mogroside where possessed through a variety of different pathways, including PI3K/AKT and TLR4/NFκB/MyD88 signaling pathway. Probably, the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway has a key impact in S. grosvenorii against pharyngitis.

Coeliac disease is caused by an acquired immune response to proline- and glutamine-rich gluten peptides, which bottleneck proteolysis and provide substrates for immune recognition. Enzyme therapies aim to eliminate gluten immunogenic peptides as an adjunct to gluten-free diet. To investigate overlooked aspects of enzyme development given difficulties in translating preclinical efficacy into clinical benefit. We assessed mode-of-action, target organ and drug delivery in the context of digestive physiology and motility for gluten-digesting enzymes on the market or in development until 1 December 2024. Most enzymes were gastric endopeptidases specific for proline or glutamine residues. Gastric enzymes may achieve poor enzyme-substrate exposure due to limited mixing and rapid emptying of water-soluble particles. Moreover, endopeptidases cleave proteins/peptides into shorter peptides but do not systematically cleave protein into absorbable fractions. Natural digestive physiology provides thorough mixing at the intestinal brush border, which produces exopeptidases necessary to fully digest proline-rich peptides. Despite reduced activity in patients with coeliac disease, exopeptidases remain underexplored as therapeutic agents. Given limited substrate scope and end-to-end digestion, exopeptidases are ineffective as single agents, requiring functional combinations. Furthermore, vulnerability to gastric acid requires stabilisation or formulation for rapid enteric release. Enzymes should be stabilised throughout the gastrointestinal tract including the small intestine. Exopeptidases perform a critical function by systematically generating absorbable fractions, warranting future investigation as therapeutic agents. Sensitive and translational biomarkers are needed to better assess enzyme efficacy in real-meal conditions.",Bonner ER; Tschollar W; Mourabit S,AMYRA Biotech AG,

Atopic dermatitis is part of a spectrum of atopic conditions that can also include several non-cutaneous organs such as respiratory (eg, allergic rhinitis and asthma) and gastrointestinal (eg, food allergy) systems. For decades, long-term disease control and maintenance were particularly challenging given that treatment options were limited to broad topical and systemic immunosuppressive agents. However, better insights into the pathophysiology of this condition over the past decade have led to the development and approval of safe and efficacious novel targeted treatment approaches.

Genetic testing is valuable for the diagnosis, prognosis, and clinical management of ADPKD. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) techniques can overcome the limitations of traditional Sanger sequencing for the genetic diagnosis of ADPKD. This study included 18 Iranian ADPKD families. Long-range PCR and Sanger sequencing were used to analyze PKD1 and PKD2. Subsequently, NGS-based gene panel testing and whole-exome sequencing (WES) were also performed in selected families. Pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants were identified in 13/18 families (72.2%), including 9 in PKD1 and 4 in PKD2. Five novel variants were discovered (c.10016C > A, c.2096_2097 + 4del, c.12138 + 5G > C in PKD1; c.2359-8_2373del, c.180_181delGC in PKD2). Additionally, WES revealed a pathogenic PKD1 frameshift deletion (c.11376delG) in one genetically unresolved family, likely missed by initial Sanger sequencing due to allelic dropout. This study expands the mutational spectrum of PKD1/PKD2 with five novel variants. The findings demonstrate the advantages of NGS over conventional Sanger sequencing methods. The genetically unresolved cases suggest the potential involvement of variants within non-coding regions, large copy number variations, or novel genes in ADPKD pathogenesis. Whole-genome sequencing is warranted to investigate these unresolved cases further.",,,m.entezam@gmail.com.

Safety data focused on serious adverse events (SAEs), all adverse events (AEs) leading to permanent treatment discontinuation irrespective of seriousness, and prespecified AEs of special interest irrespective of seriousness. Tests of treatment differences were determined by two-sided p values. The proportion of patients with SAEs was lower with semaglutide versus placebo (33.4% vs. 36.4%; p < 0.001), primarily driven by cardiac disorders (11.5% vs. 13.5%; p < 0.001). The proportion of patients with AEs leading to discontinuation was higher with semaglutide versus placebo (16.6% vs. 8.2%; p < 0.001), a difference driven by gastrointestinal disorders (10.0% vs. 2.0%); however, proportions due to SAEs leading to discontinuation were similar (3.6% vs. 4.1%). Suicide/self-injury SAEs were low and balanced between groups (0.11% in both groups). Gallbladder-related disorders were more frequent with semaglutide versus placebo (2.8% vs. 2.3%; p = 0.04), mainly driven by cholelithiasis (1.4% vs. 1.1%), whereas proportions of cholecystitis were similar between groups (0.6% vs. 0.6%).

Approvals of multiple covalent Bruton's tyrosine kinas inhibitors (cBTKis) as well as the B-cell lymphoma-2 inhibitor (BCL2i) venetoclax targeting these pathways have revolutionized the treatment of CLL and small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL). The superiority of these treatments over chemoimmunotherapy has been proven in phase III studies in both treatment-naïve and relapsed refractory settings, leading to the majority of patients with CLL being treated sequentially with cBTKis and the BCL2i venetoclax as their first- and second-line therapies. While most patients with CLL respond for many years to these sequenced treatments, they are unfortunately not curative. There remains an unmet need for effective treatment options for patients who progressed after treatment with both cBTKis and BCL2i, also referred to as double refractory patients. Treatment options for double refractory CLL has improved recently with the approval of the non-covalent BTK inhibitor (ncBTKi) pirtobrutinib as well as the CD19 targeted chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR T-cell) therapy lisocabtagene maraleucel (liso-cel). These recently approved treatment options for patients with CLL with at least two prior lines of therapy have fortunately demonstrated efficacy for double refractory CLL. Additionally, there are several novel treatment options in clinical development, including bi-specific antibodies, second-generation BCL2is, new ncBTKis, and BTK degraders. Understanding resistance mechanisms to existing cBTKis and venetoclax can potentially inform us of the best utilization of available treatment options for double refractory CLL and provide a personalized approach for these patients.

Exercise-induced circulating extracellular vesicles (EX-EVs) have been suggested to play essential roles in mediating organ crosstalk, but corresponding molecular mechanisms remain unclear. To assess and compare the systemic effects of CAT and HIIT, five healthy male volunteers were assigned to HIIT and CAT, with a 7-day interval between sessions. Plasma EVs were collected at rest or immediately after each training section, prior to proteomics and miRNA profile analysis. We found that the differentially expressed (DE) miRNAs in EX-EVs were largely involved in the regulation of transcriptional factors, while most of the DE proteins in EX-EVs were identified as non-secreted proteins. Both CAT and HIIT play common roles in neuronal signal transduction, autophagy, and cell fate regulation. Specifically, CAT showed distinct roles in cognitive function and substrate metabolism, while HIIT was more associated with organ growth, cardiac muscle function, and insulin signaling pathways. Interestingly, the miR-379 cluster within EX-EVs was specifically regulated by HIIT, involving several biological functions, including neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction. Furthermore, EX-EVs likely originate from various tissues, including metabolic tissues, the immune system, and the nervous system. Our study provides molecular insights into the effects of CAT and HIIT, shedding light on the roles of EX-EVs in mediating organ crosstalk and health promotion.",,,

Neurodegeneration begins however several years before clinical onset of motor, cognitive or autonomic symptoms. The isolated form of REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD), a parasomnia with dream enactment behaviors and excessive muscle activity during REM sleep, is an early stage synucleinopathy. The neurophysiological hallmark of RBD is REM sleep without atonia (RWSA), i.e. the loss of physiological muscle atonia during REM sleep. RBD pathophysiology is not fully clarified yet, but clinical and basic science suggest that ɑ-syn pathology begins in the lower brainstem where REM atonia circuits are located, including the sublaterodorsal tegmental/subcoeruleus nucleus and the ventral medulla, then propagates rostrally to brain regions such as the substantia nigra, limbic system, cortex. Genetically, there is only a partial overlap between RBD, PD and DLB, and individuals with iRBD may represent a specific subpopulation. A genome-wide association study identified five loci, which all seem to revolve around the GBA1 pathway. iRBD patients often show subtle motor, cognitive, autonomic and/or sensory signs, neuroimaging alterations as well as biofluid and tissue markers of neurodegeneration (in particular pathologic α-synuclein aggregates), which can be useful for risk stratification. Patients with iRBD represent thus the ideal population for neuroprotective/neuromodulating trials. This review provides insights into these aspects, highlighting and substantiating the central role of iRBD in treatment development strategies for synucleinopathies.",Arnaldi D,Clinical Neurophysiology,ziv.gan-or@mcgill.ca.

Pharmacological inhibitors of cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK) 4 and 6 (CDK4/6i) inhibit breast cancer growth by inducing a senescent-like state. However, the long-term treatment efficacy remains limited by the development of drug resistance, so clearance of senescent-like cancer cells may extend the durability of treatment. However, we show here that while CDK4/6i-treated breast cancer cells exhibit various senescence-associated phenotypes, they remain insensitive to common senolytic compounds. By searching for novel vulnerabilities, we identify a significantly increased lysosomal mass and altered lysosomal structure across various breast cancer cell types upon exposure to CDK4/6i in preclinical systems and clinical specimens. We demonstrate that these CDK4/6i-induced lysosomal alterations render breast cancer cells sensitive to lysosomotropic agents, such as L-leucyl-L-leucine methyl ester (LLOMe) and salinomycin. Importantly, sequential treatment with CDK4/6i and lysosomotropic agents effectively reduces the growth of both hormone receptor-positive (HR",Bravaccini S; Zanoni M; Gianni C; De Giorgi U,"IRCCS Istituto Romagnolo per lo Studio dei Tumori (IRST) ""Dino Amadori""",b.wang01@umcg.nl.

Their contribution is beneficial for any research project. Although the inclusion of PRPs in rheumatology research is increasingly recommended, its practical implementation, particularly in translational research, remains limited . Enhancing PRP engagement requires a clear understanding of the necessary steps. This study aims to show steps to achieve successful collaboration between PRPs and researchers in clinical and transitional research in rheumatology. We established a PRP network by following five main steps: setting up infrastructure, recruitment, training, PRP involvement at an early stage, and ongoing support. We adhered to overall principles of openness, feedback, and regular evaluations to create a respectful and collaborative environment. The initiative was qualitatively assessed via an online questionnaire developed by each six researchers and PRPs. Communicating our initiative at laboratory open days and to patient associations has enabled to create a network of 66 PRPs. A match-making tool was introduced to allocate interested PRPs with a project request. This led to PRP involvement in 15 projects, including 9 in translational research. Two PRP-coordinators provided support including glossaries and educational courses . Our initiative outlines five essential steps for establishing PRP collaboration in rheumatology research, including translational research.

39928855,17(R)-Resolvin D1 protects against sickle cell-related inflammatory cardiomyopathy in humanized mice.,2025-04-24,Blood,10.1182/blood.2024024768,"Cardiovascular disease has been recognized as the main cause of death in adults with sickle cell disease (SCD). Although the exact mechanism linking SCD to cardiomyopathy remains elusive, a possible role of subclinical acute transient myocardial ischemia during acute sickle cell-related vaso-occlusive crises (VOCs) has been suggested. We approached SCD cardiomyopathy by integrated omics using humanized SS mice exposed to hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R; 10 hours hypoxia followed by 3 hours reoxygenation) stress, mimicking acute VOCs. In sickle cell (SS) mice exposed to H/R, a neutrophil-driven cardiac hypertrophic response is initiated by cardiac proinflammatory pathways, intersecting proteins and micro RNA involved in profibrotic signaling. This response may be facilitated by local unresolved inflammation. We then examined the effect of 17(R)-resolvin D1 (17R-RvD1), a member of the specialized proresolving lipid mediator superfamily, administration on H/R-activated profibrotic and proangiogenic pathways. In SS mice, we found that 17R-RvD1 (1) modulates miRNAome; (2) prevents the activation of NF-κB p65; (3) protects against the H/R-induced activation of both platelet derived growth factor receptor and transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1/Smad2-3 canonical pathways; (4) reduces the expression of hypoxia-inducible factor-dependent proangiogenic signaling; and (5) decreases the H/R-induced proapoptotic cell signature. The protective role of 17R-RvD1 against H/R-induced maladaptive heart remodeling was supported by the reduction of galectin-3, procollagen C-proteinase enhancer-1, and endothelin-1 expression and perivascular fibrosis in SS mice at 3 days after H/R stress compared with vehicle-treated SS animals. Collectively, our data support the novel role of unresolved inflammation in pathologic heart remodeling in SCD mice in response to H/R stress. Our study provides new evidence for protective effects of 17R-RvD1 against SCD-related cardiovascular disease.",Monti M; Cozzolino F; Gremese E,Division of Clinical Immunology; Dipartimento Scienze Chimiche,

Altered sialylation is involved in tumor development, affecting immune microenvironment dynamics. In the study, through systematic bioinformatics analysis and experimental verification, we demonstrated that ST3Gal5 expression was elevated in tumor tissues of KIRC patients, correlating with poor prognosis, and ST3Gal1 was downregulated and associated with a better prognosis. Immunohistochemistry analysis confirmed the expression patterns of ST3Gal1 and ST3Gal5 in 30 KIRC patients. Furthermore, KIRC patients were stratified into two clusters based on ST3Gal1 and ST3Gal5 levels using consensus clustering to investigate their roles in KIRC tumorigenesis, immune characteristics and treatment sensitivity. KIRC patients in Cluster 2, characterized by increased ST3Gal5 and downregulated ST3Gal1 expression, exhibited increased expression of immune checkpoints, immune cell infiltration, immune escape scores, and worse prognosis. Knockdown of ST3Gal5 in KIRC cell lines (786-O and 769-P) resulted in reduced tumor proliferation, migration, and invasion in vivo and in vitro. Together, the dysregulation of sialyltransferases (ST3Gal1 and ST3Gal5) in KIRC influences tumorigenesis and immune responses. These findings underscore the potential of ST3Gal1 and ST3Gal5 as prognostic factors and immunotherapy targets for KIRC.",,,chenqiwei@dmu.edu.cn.

We proposed a classification and grading system for dural incisions based on the type and degree of suture, and based on the system, a standardized operation process for ADS (absorbable dural sealant) was developed. Then, we conducted a retrospective study. We divided the included patients into 3 groups. Normalized group follows the ADS standard use process proposed by us, while Empirical group does not meet or only partially meets the ADS standard use process, or uses ADS based on its own experience, and Non-sealant group were patients who did not use ADS. And perioperative infection was used as the primary assessment metric to verify the effectiveness of ADS in blocking the dural membrane, and to try to propose a standardized use plan. A retrospective collection of 383 patients' clinical data was conducted between October 2019 and April 2023 in the Department of Neurosurgery of Qilu Hospital of Shandong University. Of them, 128 belonged to the non-sealant group, 126 to the normalized group, and 129 to the empirical group.

As the first global registry for adults with severe asthma, ISAR enabled individual registries to standardize and pool their data, creating a comprehensive, harmonized dataset with sufficient statistical power to address key research questions and knowledge gaps. Today, ISAR is the largest repository of real-world data on severe asthma, curating data on nearly 35,000 patients from 28 countries worldwide, and has become a leading contributor to severe asthma research. Research using ISAR data has provided valuable insights on the characteristics of severe asthma, its burdens and risk factors, real-world treatment effectiveness, and barriers to specialist care, which are collectively informing improved asthma management. Besides changing clinical thinking via research, ISAR aims to advance real-world practice through initiatives that improve registry data quality and severe asthma care. In 2024, ISAR refined essential research variables to enhance data quality and launched a web-based data acquisition and reporting system (QISAR), which integrates data collection with clinical consultations and enables longitudinal data tracking at patient, center, and population levels. Quality improvement priorities include collecting standardized data during consultations and tracking and optimizing patient journeys via QISAR and integrating primary/secondary care pathways to expedite specialist severe asthma management and facilitate clinical trial recruitment.

However, PCSK9 inhibitors such as alirocumab lower both lipoprotein(a) and LDL-C without effect on NOD. In a post hoc analysis of the ODYSSEY OUTCOMES trial (NCT01663402), we examined the joint prediction of NOD by baseline lipoprotein(a), LDL-C, and insulin (or HOMA-insulin resistance [HOMA-IR]) and their changes with alirocumab treatment. Analyses included 8,107 patients with recent acute coronary syndrome on optimized statin therapy, without diabetes at baseline, assigned to alirocumab or placebo with median follow-up 2.4 years. Splines were estimated from logistic regression models. Lower baseline lipoprotein(a) and higher baseline insulin or HOMA-IR independently predicted 782 cases of NOD; baseline LDL-C did not predict NOD. Alirocumab reduced lipoprotein(a) and LDL-C without affecting insulin or NOD risk (odds ratio [OR] vs. placebo 0.998; 95% CI 0.860-1.158). However, in logistic regression, decreased lipoprotein(a) and LDL-C on alirocumab were independent, opposite predictors of NOD.

NKCEs offer a significant advancement over conventional monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) by enhancing Antibody-Dependent Cellular Cytotoxicity (ADCC). They achieve this by stably and selectively binding to both NK cell activating receptors and tumor-associated antigens (TAAs). Unlike traditional mAbs, which depend on the relatively transient interaction between their Fc region and CD16a, NKCEs establish more robust connections with a range of activating receptors (e.g., CD16a, NKG2D, NKp30, NKp46, NKG2C) and inhibitory receptors (e.g., Siglec-7) on NK cells, thereby increasing cancer cell killing efficacy and specificity. This review article critically examines the strategies for engineering bi-, tri-, and multi-specific NKCEs for cancer immunotherapy, providing an in-depth analysis of the latest advancements in NKCE platform technologies currently under development by pharmaceutical and biotech companies and discussing the preclinical and clinical progress of these products. While NKCEs show great promise, the review underscores the need for continued research to optimize their therapeutic efficacy and to overcome obstacles related to NK cell functionality in cancer patients.

Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK) is involved in innate immunity, and BTK inhibitors block cytokine release. We assessed the next-generation BTK inhibitor zanubrutinib in SARS-CoV-2-infected patients with respiratory distress. Cohort 1 had a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled design; cohort 2 had a single-arm design. Adults with SARS-CoV-2 requiring hospitalization (without mechanical ventilation) were randomized in cohort 1. Those on mechanical ventilation ≤24 hours were enrolled in cohort 2. Patients were randomized 1:1 to zanubrutinib 320 mg once daily or placebo (cohort 1), or received zanubrutinib 320 mg once daily (cohort 2). Co-primary endpoints were respiratory failure-free survival rate and time to return to breathing room air at 28 days. Corollary studies to assess zanubrutinib's impact on immune response were performed. Sixty-three patients in cohort 1 received zanubrutinib (n=30) or placebo (n=33), with median treatment duration of 8.5 and 7.0 days, respectively. The median treatment duration in cohort 2 (n=4) was 13 days; all discontinued treatment early. In cohort 1, respiratory failure-free survival and the estimated rates of not returning to breathing room air by day 28 were not significantly different between treatments. Importantly, serological response to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was not impacted by zanubrutinib. Lower levels of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, interleukin (IL)-10, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, IL-4, and IL-13 were observed in zanubrutinib-treated patients. Moreover, single-cell transcriptome analysis showed significant downregulation of inflammatory mediators (IL-6, IL-8, macrophage colony-stimulating factor, macrophage inflammatory protein-1α, IL-1β) and signaling pathways (JAK1, STAT3, TYK2), and activation of gamma-delta T cells in zanubrutinib-treated patients. Marked reduction in inflammatory signaling with preserved SARS-CoV-2 serological response was observed in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 respiratory distress receiving zanubrutinib. Despite these immunological findings, zanubrutinib did not show improvement over placebo in clinical recovery from respiratory distress. Concurrent administration of steroids and antiviral therapy to most patients may have contributed to these results. Investigation of zanubrutinib may be warranted in other settings where cytokine release and immune cell exhaustion are important. https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04382586, identifier NCT04382586.",Gathe JC; Farber CM; Holmgren E; Kim P; Shi C; Lin H; Ramakrishnan V; Ou Y; Olszewski S; Tankersley C; Zimmerman T,Therapeutic Concepts; Atlantic Health System; BeiGene USA,

Thus, novel treatment options such as swallowed topical tacrolimus, particularly for refractory cases, are urgently needed. We retrospectively analyzed patients with LyE enrolled in the Swiss eosinophilic esophagitis database that received treatment with a swallowed tacrolimus syrup (1 mg bid). We compared clinical (visual analogue scale [VAS] 0-10), endoscopic (VAS, Endoscopic Reference Score [EREFS]), and histological (peak lymphocyte count) disease activity before versus after treatment. Out of 17 LyE patients, we identified a total of 7 patients undergoing tacrolimus treatment (4 males, median age 71.3 years, IQR: 61.3-76.5, median diagnostic delay of 51.0 months, IQR: 24.5-62.0). Six patients had been previously treated with PPI, five with topical and/or systemic steroids. All patients were treated with topical tacrolimus corresponding to 1 mg bid (for a median of 13 weeks, IQR: 11-15). All patients had clinically, and histologically active disease at baseline. Topical tacrolimus treatment resulted in histological remission (<30 lymphocytes/hpf) in 3/7 patients (42.9%), while 4/7 patients achieved symptomatic remission (VAS for dysphagia ≤2, 57.1%). Overall, clinical (VAS 5 vs. 2,  Topical tacrolimus appears to be a potential treatment option for severe LyE, particularly after failure of PPI and/or topical steroids.

Methods & clinical development,10.1016/j.omtm.2024.101399,"The multi-administration of recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV) is limited largely by immunological barriers. Herein, a novel strategy, named rAAV pseudo-lipid nanoparticle combined with triamcinolone acetonide (LNP-rAAV + TAC), has been described in mice. We showed successful but low efficient triple trafficking by LNP-rAAV2 carrying EGFP, human factor IX (hFIX), and luciferase (luc), due to its encapsulation characteristic. Additionally, sustained TAC treatment, which dose-dependently downregulated the anti-rAAV2 antibodies, permitted rAAV2 re-administration at dosages of ≥45 mg/kg/3 days. Furthermore, to improve the efficiency and safety, LNP-rAAV + TAC was evaluated, using LNP-rAAV2 carrying EGFP, hFIX, and luc co-treating with 45 mg/kg/3 days TAC before and after treatment with LNP-rAAV2 injections. Notable neutralizing antibody reductions of 37.8-fold and 12.7-fold were observed by the combinatorial strategy compared with the independent LNP encapsulation and TAC treatment approaches.

Cardiac PDE2-transgenic mice are protected against contractile dysfunction and arrhythmias in heart failure but whether an acute elevation of PDE2 could be of therapeutic value remains elusive. This hypothesis was tested using cardiac PDE2 gene transfer in preclinical models of heart failure. C57BL/6 male mice were injected with serotype 9 adeno-associated viruses encoding for PDE2A. This led to a ≈10-fold rise of PDE2A protein levels that affected neither cardiac structure nor function in healthy mice. Two weeks after inoculation with serotype 9 adeno-associated viruses, mice were implanted with minipumps delivering either NaCl, isoproterenol (60 mg/kg per day), or isoproterenol and phenylephrine (30 mg/kg per day each) for 2 weeks. In mice injected with serotype 9 adeno-associated viruses encoding for LUC (luciferase), isoproterenol or isoproterenol+phenylephrine infusion induced left ventricular hypertrophy, decreased ejection fraction unveiled by echocardiography, and promoted fibrosis and apoptosis assessed by Masson's trichrome and Tunel, respectively. Furthermore, inotropic responses to isoproterenol of ventricular cardiomyocytes isolated from isoproterenol+phenylephrine-LUC mice loaded with 1 μmol/L Fura-2AM and stimulated at 1 Hz to record calcium transients and sarcomere shortening were dampened. Spontaneous calcium waves at the cellular level were promoted as well as ventricular arrhythmias evoked in vivo by catheter-mediated ventricular pacing after isoproterenol (1.5 mg/kg) and atropine (1 mg/kg) injection. However, increased PDE2A blunted these adverse outcomes evoked by sympathomimetic amines. Cardiac gene therapy with PDE2A limits left ventricle remodeling, dysfunction, and arrhythmias evoked by catecholamines, providing evidence that increasing PDE2A activity acutely could prevent progression toward heart failure.",Kamel R; Bourcier A; Margaria JP; Jin V; Varin A; Hivonnait A; Mercier-Nomé F; Mika D; Charpentier F; Algalarrondo V; Fischmeister R; Vandecasteele G; Leroy J,Université Paris-Saclay; Nantes Université,

We present a post hoc analysis of efficacy according to primary tumor location. KEYNOTE-716 (NCT03553836) is a randomized, multicenter, double-blind, phase III study. Patients aged ≥ 12 years with newly diagnosed, resected stage IIB or IIC melanoma (sentinel node-negative) were randomly assigned (1:1) to pembrolizumab 200 mg every 3 weeks (2 mg/kg up to 200 mg for pediatric patients) or placebo. This post hoc analysis evaluated RFS and DMFS by primary tumor location of the head/neck, trunk, or extremities. Overall, 976 patients were assigned to pembrolizumab (n = 487) or placebo (n = 489). Median follow-up was 39.4 months (range 26.0-51.4). The hazard ratios {HRs (95% confidence interval [CI])} for RFS were 0.60 (0.38-0.93) for the head/neck subgroup, 0.57 (0.38-0.84) for the trunk subgroup, and 0.69 (0.47-1.02) for the extremities subgroup.

RFS and DMFS consistently favored adjuvant pembrolizumab over placebo in most subgroups analyzed in this post hoc analysis from the KEYNOTE-716 trial.

Whether joints at different anatomical locations might respond differentially to TNFi remains unknown. The aim of the study was to investigate potential variations in the responsiveness to a first tumour necrosis factor inhibitor (TNFi) among joints at distinct locations in patients with psoriatic arthritis (PsA) treated in routine clinical care. Bionaive PsA patients from nine European countries were included in this observational cohort study if ≥ 1 joint was swollen at the initiation of a first TNFi as monotherapy or added to methotrexate. Only the 28-joint count was available without imaging data confirming the presence of synovitis. The primary outcome was time to first resolution of joint swelling at each joint level. Hazard ratios (HR) for resolution comparing different joint locations were estimated using interval-censored mixed-effects Cox proportional hazards models, including a random effect for country and patient, adjusted for age and sex. A total of 1729 patients with 8397 swollen joints at the start of TNFi were included. Considering the upper extremity, a higher rate of resolution of joint swelling (HR, 95% CI) was observed for the shoulder (1.65, 1.16-2.35) and elbow (1.90, 1.38-2.61), while a lower rate was found for the wrist (0.72, 0.62-0.83) compared to the joints of digit 3. Within fingers, and using the same reference, joint swelling resolved fastest in digit 4 (1.77, 1.49-2.11) and digit 5 (1.88, 1.53-2.31). A lower rate of resolution of joint swelling was found for the knee in comparison to the elbow, the corresponding joint on the upper limb (0.56, 0.40-0.78). The time to resolution of joint swelling upon treatment with TNFi in patients with PsA seems to depend on the localisation of the affected joints.",Kissling S; Götschi A; Scherer A; Bräm R,Statistics Group; Swiss Ankylosing Spondylitis Association,adrian.ciurea@usz.ch.

In particular, four antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) therapies targeting various DMD-causing mutations have achieved FDA approval, marking major milestones in the treatment of this disease. These compounds are designed to induce alternative splicing events that restore the translation reading frame of the dystrophin gene, leading to the generation of internally-deleted, but mostly functional, pseudodystrophin proteins with the potential to compensate for the genetic loss of dystrophin. However, the efficacy of these compounds is very limited, with delivery remaining a key obstacle to effective therapy. There is therefore an urgent need for improved ASO technologies with better efficacy, and with applicability to a wider range of patient mutations. Here we discuss recent developments in ASO therapies for DMD, and future prospects with a focus on ASO chemical modification and bioconjugation strategies.",,,thomas.roberts@idrm.ox.ac.uk.

Murine Arg1-specific CD4+T cells isolated from splenocytes of animals vaccinated with an Arg1-derived peptide in the adjuvant montanide were co-cultured with either  We show that Arg1-based IMV-mediated tumor control was linked to a decrease in multiple immunosuppressive pathways in the TAM population of the treated animals. Tumor-conditioned media (TCM) derived from Arg1-vaccinated mice induced significantly higher upregulation of MHC-II on exposed myeloid cells compared with controls. Furthermore, murine CD4+Arg1-specific T cells were able to target TAMs and effectively reprogram their phenotype  TAMs may be directly targeted and modulated by Arg1-specific CD4+T cells. These findings provide a strong rationale for future clinical development of Arg1-based IMVs to alter the immune-suppressive TME by reprogramming TAMs and promoting a proinflammatory TME.",Chapellier M; Pedersen AW,IO Biotech ApS,Mads.Hald.Andersen@regionh.dk.

The guiding principle for an IRA includes a comprehensive evaluation of product- and patient-related factors that may influence the immunogenic potential of a biotherapeutic drug and a potential action plan. The Immunogenicity Working Group from the IQ Consortium (Clinical Pharmacology Leadership Group) has conducted a survey to understand the current practices for conducting IRAs and relevant aspects of bioanalysis. Survey results were provided by 19 IQ member companies participating in the Clinical Pharmacology Leadership Group (CPLG) and the Translational and ADME Sciences Leadership Group (TALG). Nearly all the respondents reported experience with monoclonal antibodies (mAb), with 10 other drug modalities including bioengineered protein therapeutics such as fusion and multi-domain proteins, peptides, oligonucleotides as well as gene and cell therapies. The survey results demonstrate that most companies have a defined IRA process, and there was a common understanding that the IRA may need to be revised as more information becomes available or the drug development strategy changes. Some differences found across the respondents are related to the time frame for implementation of IRA document, the types of preclinical data and computational methods used to assess risk, and how the IRA informs clinical plans and documentation practices. These results highlight that while there have been widespread insights gained with performing IRA for mAbs, more experience is needed to perform IRAs for the novel modalities.",Grimaldi C; Richards S; Baltrukonis D; Sims Belouski S; Coble K; Dholakiya SL; Grudzinska-Goebel J; Kolaitis G; Leu JH; Luo L; Lowe S; Niu T; Toft-Hansen H; Yang J; Wu B,Pharmaceuticals R&D; Non-Clinical and Clinical Assay Sciences; Bioanlytical Sciences; Nonclinical and Bioanalytical Development; Clinical Pharmacology; Regulated Bioanalytics; Johnson & Johnson Innovative Medicine; Translational Medicine and Early Development; Bioanalytical Sciences; Lilly Centre for Clinical Pharmacology; Translational Clinical Sciences; Oncology Clinical Pharmacology; Quantitative Clinical Pharmacology,

The purpose of this phase I study was to define the safety and efficacy of botensilimab (BOT), an Fc-enhanced anti-cytotoxic lymphocyte-association protein-4 antibody, plus balstilimab (BAL), an anti-PD-1 antibody, in advanced sarcomas. BOT was administered intravenously (IV) at 1 mg/kg or 2 mg/kg once every 6 weeks in combination with BAL IV at 3 mg/kg once every 2 weeks for up to 2 years. The primary end point was to determine dose-limiting toxicities during the dose-escalation period. Secondary end points include objective response rate (ORR), duration of response (DOR), disease control rate, and progression-free survival (PFS) by RECIST 1.1. Exploratory end points include assessing patient biomarkers including tumor mutational burden, cytokines, and PD-L1 expression. Overall, 64 patients with sarcoma were treated; all were evaluable for safety and 52 for efficacy. The most common treatment-related adverse event (TRAE) was diarrhea/colitis occurring in 35.9% of patients, with grade 3 in 6.3% of patients. No grade 4 or 5 TRAEs were reported. For all evaluable patients, ORR was 19.2% (95% CI, 9.6 to 32.5), and 27.8% (95% CI, 9.7 to 53.5) for evaluable patients with angiosarcoma (n = 18); 33.3% in visceral and 22.2% in cutaneous subtypes.

The molecular mechanism of ccRCC development, however, needs further study. Aurora kinase B (AURKB) functions as an important oncogene in various tumors; therefore, in the present study, we aimed to explore the mechanism by which AURKB affects ccRCC development. We performed bioinformatics analysis, CCK-8 assay, RNA sequencing, RT-PCR and Western blot to analyze the function and mechanism of AURKB in ccRCC. TIMER2.0 showed that AURKB was overexpressed in Kidney Renal Clear Cell Carcinoma (KIRC), the UALCAN database showed the survival rate of KIRC patients with different expression levels of AURKB and different gender indicated in the same gender, high AURKB expression predicts lower survival rate. Silencing of AURKB expression inhibits the proliferation of ccRCC cells. RNA-seq data suggested that AURKB is involved in fatty acid metabolism. Silencing of AURKB inhibited the expression of fatty acid synthase (FASN). FASN is a key gene involved in fatty acid metabolism. TIMER2.0 showed that FASN is upregulated in KIRC. Silencing of FASN inhibited the proliferation of ccRCC cells. AURKB induces the proliferation of ccRCC cells by regulating fatty acid metabolism.",,,ruifang_sun@mail.xjtu.edu.cn.

Currently, there is a major paradigm shift in the management of these diseases, towards the concept of disease modification and the treatment goal remission, regardless of severity and age. Remission as a treatment goal in chronic inflammatory NCDs was first introduced in rheumatoid arthritis, and then adopted in other non-type 2 inflammatory diseases. Among diseases with type 2 Inflammation, this concept is novel and currently most advanced in asthma. This new paradigm has been developed based on a better understanding of the pathophysiology of type 2 inflammation and the advent of highly effective drugs selectively interfering with type 2 pathways.

Our aim was to assess longitudinal protein and metabolite composition in AD skin during dupilumab treatment. Skin tape strips (STSs) were collected from lesional/nonlesional skin of 20 patients with AD during a 16-week dupilumab treatment course and from 20 healthy volunteers (HVs) followed for 16 weeks. STS extracts were examined by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry proteomic analysis and targeted metabolomics. Approximately 2500 individual proteins were identified in the STS extracts. Of those proteins, 490 were present in at least 80% of the AD and HV skin samples and differentially expressed in the AD skin; the levels of 249 proteins were significantly reduced (cluster 1), and the levels of 136 were significantly increased (cluster 2) in the AD skin versus in the HV skin (both P < .0001). Functionally, cluster 1 included proteins involved in epidermal barrier formation, lysosomal enzymes required for lamellae assembly, and oxidative response. Cluster 2 was enriched for markers of epidermal hyperplasia, glycolytic enzymes, and actin filament proteins. A significant increase in cluster 1 and a significant inhibition of cluster 2 proteins expression were achieved in AD skin by 16 weeks of dupilumab treatment (P < .0001 for both vs baseline), approaching the levels in HV skin. These improvements were also revealed in differential metabolite changes in the STS extracts, including amino acids, nucleotide breakdown products, and antioxidants. Longitudinal integrated assessment of the skin proteome and metabolome in patients with AD who were treated with dupilumab established significant inhibition of epidermal hyperplasia and improvement in epidermal differentiation. The identified changes were linked to improvements in clinical AD skin assessments, including improvements in transepidermal water loss and disease severity.",Goleva E; Berdyshev E; Bronova I; Lyubchenko T; Richers BN; Hall CF; Xiao O; Bronoff AS; Bafna S; Agueusop I; Gloaguen E; Zahn J; Bissonnette R; Zhang A; Leung DYM,Sanofi; Regeneron Pharmaceuticals; Innovaderm Research; National Jewish Health,Leungd@njhealth.org.

39861949,Caution when using network partners for target identification in drug discovery.,2025-04-11,HGG advances,10.1016/j.xhgg.2025.100409,"Identifying novel, high-yield drug targets is challenging and often results in a high failure rate. However, recent data indicate that leveraging human genetic evidence to identify and validate these targets significantly increases the likelihood of success in drug development. Two recent papers from Open Targets claimed that around half of US Food and Drug Administration-approved drugs had targets with direct human genetic evidence. By expanding target identification to include protein network partners-molecules in physical contact-the proportion of drug targets with genetic evidence support increased to two-thirds. However, the efficacy of using these network partners for target identification was not formally tested. To address this, we tested the approach on a list of robust positive control genes. We used the IntAct database to find physically interacting proteins of genes identified by exome-wide association studies (ExWASs), genome-wide association studies (GWASs) combined with a locus-to-gene mapping algorithm called the Effector Index, and Genetic Priority Score (GPS), which integrated eight genetic features with drug indications from the Open Targets and SIDER databases. We assessed how accurately including interacting genes with the ExWAS-, Effector Index-, and GPS-selected genes identified positive controls, focusing on precision, sensitivity, and specificity. Our results indicated that although molecular interactions led to higher sensitivity in identifying positive control genes, their practical application is limited by low precision. Expanding genetically identified targets to include network partners using IntAct did not increase the likelihood of identifying drug targets across the 412 tested traits, suggesting that such results should be interpreted with caution.",,,brent.richards@mcgill.ca.

Frequently, the first-line treatment for metastatic CRC consists of the intravenous administration of 5-fluorouracil and leucovorin in combination with oxaliplatin or irinotecan. Physiologically-based pharmacokinetic models (PBPK) aim to mechanistically incorporate body physiology and drug physicochemical attributes, enabling the description of both systemic and organ drug exposure based on the treatment specificities. This bottom-up approach represents an opportunity to personalize treatment and minimize the therapeutic risk/benefit ratio through the understanding of drug distribution within colorectal tissue. This project has the goal of characterizing the systemic and tissue exposure of four anti-cancer drugs in humans using a PBPK platform fed with data from the literature. A literature search was performed to collect clinical data on systemic concentration versus time profiles. Physicochemical features were obtained from the literature, as well as parameters associated with distribution, metabolism, and excretion. The PBPK models were built using PK-Sim The data from 51 clinical studies were extracted and combined in one single dataset. The PBPK models successfully described the exposure vs. time profiles with respect to both, with both the typical tendency and dispersion shown by the data. The percentage of observations falling within the two-fold error bounds ranged between 94 and 100%.

By integrating two-step proteome-wide Mendelian randomization, colocalization, epigenomics and single-cell RNA sequencing, we identified five mediators and prioritized collagen type VI α3 (COL6A3). COL6A3 levels were strongly increased by body mass index and increased coronary artery disease risk. Notably, the carboxyl terminus product of COL6A3, endotrophin, drove this effect. COL6A3 was highly expressed in disease-relevant cell types and tissues. Finally, we found that body fat reduction could reduce plasma levels of COL6A3-derived endotrophin, indicating a tractable way to modify endotrophin levels. In summary, we provide actionable insights into how circulating proteins mediate the effects of obesity on cardiometabolic diseases and prioritize endotrophin as a potential therapeutic target.",Wang S; Forgetta V,SomaLogic; 5 Prime Sciences,satoshi.yoshiji@mcgill.ca.

This open label, phase 2 basket trial assessed the antitumor activity of combining talabostat and pembrolizumab (anti-programmed death-1 antibody) in advanced solid tumor patients. The primary objective was assessment of dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) rates in the first six patients (lead-in stage) and response rate (efficacy stage; included cohort A [checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) naive] and cohort B [ICI pretreated]) for the study treatment using the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1 and immune RECIST (iRECIST). Efficacy was assessed using a Bayesian optimal phase 2 design. A total of 31 patients enrolled in this trial (14 in cohort A, 17 in cohort B). The median age was 61 years; 17 (55%) patients were male and 21 (68%) patients were White. Among 19 (61%) patients evaluable for response, the best response was stable disease in nine patients, unconfirmed progressive disease in seven patients, and clinical progressive disease in three patients based on iRECIST. Disease control rate was 47%. One patient with programmed death-ligand 1 negative, microsatellite stable endometrial cancer had unconfirmed partial response. Median progression-free survival was 2.7 months; median overall survival was 20.5 months. One patient (cohort A) experienced a grade 4 hypotension as a DLT and treatment discontinuation.

Here we tested associations between these biomarkers and ileal resection inflammation and collagen content. Fifty CD patients undergoing ileal resection were prospectively enrolled at 4 centers. Circulating CD64, extracellular matrix protein 1 (ECM1), GM-CSF autoantibodies (GM-CSF Ab), and fecal calprotectin were measured by ELISA. Ileal 3-dimensional magnetization transfer ratio (3D MTR), modified Look-Locker inversion recovery (MOLLI) T1 relaxation, diffusion-weighted intravoxel incoherent motion (IVIM), and the simplified magnetic resonance index of activity (sMaRIA) were measured by MRI. Ileal resection specimen acute inflammation was graded, and collagen content was measured quantitatively using second harmonic imaging microscopy. Associations between biomarkers and ileal collagen content were tested. Median (interquartile range [IQR]) age was 19.5 (16-33) years. We observed an inverse relationship between ileal acute inflammation and collagen content (r = -0.39 [95% confidence interval {CI}: -0.61, -0.10], P = .008). Most patients (33 [66%]) received biologics, with no variation in collagen content with treatment exposures. In the univariate analysis, CD64, GM-CSF Ab, fecal calprotectin, and sMaRIA were positively associated with acute inflammation and negatively associated with collagen content (P < .1). The multivariable model for ileal collagen content (R2 = 0.31 [95% CI: 0.11, 0.52]) included log CD64 (β = -.27; P = .19), log ECM1 (β = .47; P = .06), log GM-CSF Ab (β = -.15; P = .01), IVIM f (β = .29, P = .10), and IVIM D* (β = 1.69, P = .13). Clinically available and exploratory circulating and MRI biomarkers are associated with the degree of inflammation versus fibrosis in CD ileal resections. With further validation, these biomarkers may be used to guide medical and surgical decision-making for refractory CD.

Empirical studies have demonstrated that H7N9 AIV holds the potential to trigger a human pandemic. Vaccines constitute the sole armament available to humanity in combating influenza epidemics. DNA vaccines present numerous merits; however, substantial conundrums persist regarding how to augment their immunogenicity and implement their delivery through mucosal immunization. In this study; BALB/c mice were utilized as a model to investigate the effect of CCL19 as a molecular adjuvant and to determine the immune response elicited by polyethylene imine (PEI) and chitosan (CS) as adjuvants during the delivery of a DNA vaccine through the nasal mucosal route. Our results revealed that the CCL19 molecular adjuvant exerts a substantial immunomodulatory enhancement effect on the H7N9-HA DNA vaccine, inducing more pronounced cellular and humoral immunity. Additionally, our results indicated that the composite formed by the HA-CCL19 DNA in combination with PEI and CS effectively activates local mucosal immunity as well as systemic humoral and cellular immunity, offering 100% protection against lethal doses of homologous virus challenges. CCL19 conspicuously augments the immunogenicity of the influenza virus HA DNA and conserves the integrity of the vaccine antigen. Simultaneously, CS and PEI proficiently facilitate the mucosal delivery of DNA, thereby eliciting mucosal immunity related to DNA vaccines. This study investigated the feasibility of utilizing nasal mucosa for DNA vaccine immunization, which holds significant implications for the advancement and application of DNA vaccines in public health.",Xiang Y; Zhang H; An Y; Chen Z,Department of Basic Research,

There is an unmet need for effective first-line systemic treatments with good safety profiles, particularly oral medications. Orismilast is a novel first-in-class oral phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE4) B/D inhibitor under investigation for the treatment of moderate-to-severe AD. To evaluate the optimal dose, efficacy and safety of twice-daily orismilast in patients with moderate-to-severe AD. This 16-week, multicentre randomized placebo-controlled phase IIb dose-ranging study (NCT05469464) included patients from 48 centres in Europe and the USA. Adults with moderate-to-severe AD were given (1 : 1 : 1 : 1) orismilast 20 mg, 30 mg or 40 mg, or placebo, twice daily. The primary endpoint was percentage change in Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI); the secondary endpoints (all at week 16) included achievement of a score of clear (0) or almost clear (1) with ≥ 2-point improvement on the Investigator Global Assessment (IGA 0/1); achievement of a Peak Pruritus Numerical Rating Scale (PP-NRS) reduction of ≥ 4 points; and achievement of a reduction in EASI of 75%, 90% and 100% from baseline. Overall, 233 patients were randomly assigned to orismilast 20 mg (n = 58), 30 mg (n = 61), 40 mg (n = 59) or placebo (n = 55). At week 16, reductions in EASI (percentage points) from baseline to week 16 were seen across orismilast groups and placebo (P > 0.05 for orismilast vs. placebo). Significantly more patients achieved IGA 0/1 with a ≥ 2-point improvement with orismilast 20 mg and 40 mg compared with placebo (P < 0.05). Significantly greater proportions of patients achieving a ≥ 4-point reduction in PP-NRS were demonstrated with orismilast at week 2. The safety profile was consistent with that of the PDE4 class, with no major safety concerns reported. These data support the clinical relevance of selective PDE4B/D inhibition with orismilast, potentially offering a convenient, novel oral therapy for the treatment of AD. Atopic dermatitis (‘AD’ for short) is also known as eczema. It is a common condition that causes red, itchy and inflamed skin. It also affects a person’s immune system. We aimed to find the best dose of a new medication called ‘orismilast’. We also wanted to check how well it works and how safe it is for adults with moderate-to-severe AD. For 16 weeks, people with AD were randomly given either 20, 30 or 40 milligrams of orismilast twice a day, or a placebo (a pill with no active medication). We measured how well the treatment worked by looking at the number of people whose skin cleared up or almost cleared up and how much itching was reduced. We used a measurement tool called the ‘EASI’ to monitor improvements. We also looked for side effects to check the medication’s safety. By week 16, more people who took 20 or 40 milligram doses of orismilast had clearer skin than those taking the placebo. People who took orismilast also reported less itching as early as week 2. Improvements in EASI score were seen across all the groups, including those taking placebo. The side effects were similar to those seen with other similar medications. Studies that divide patients into smaller groups to test different doses can lead to variation. This must be considered when assessing how well different doses of a medication work and which doses should be taken into the next trials. We suggest that orismilast could be a promising new treatment for people with AD.",Felding J; Weiss A; Pedersen CB; Jensen ML; Carlsson A; Sommer MOA; Kjøller K,UNION therapeutics,

We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess and compare the prevalence of SIBO among CLD patients (with and without with complications of end stage liver disease) and healthy controls. Electronic databases were searched from inception up to July-2024 for case-control studies reporting SIBO in CLD. Prevalence rates, odds ratios (ORs), and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of SIBO in patients with CLD and controls were calculated utilizing a random-effects model. The protocol was prospectively registered with PROSPERO (CRD42022379578). The final dataset included 34 case-control studies with 2130 CLD patients and 1222 controls. Overall, the odds for SIBO prevalence in CLD patients compared to controls was 6.7 (95% CI 4.6-9.7, p < 0.001). Although the prevalence of SIBO among patients with CLD with cirrhosis was higher at 42.9% (95% CI: 35.9-50.2) compared to 36.9% (95% CI: 27.4-47.6) in those without cirrhosis, this difference failed statistical significance. However, CLD patients with decompensated cirrhosis had a significantly higher prevalence of SIBO compared to those with compensated cirrhosis, with an OR of 2.6 (95% CI: 1.5-4.5, p < 0.001). Additionally, the prevalence of SIBO was significantly higher in CLD patients with portal hypertension (PHT) than in those without PHT, with an OR of 2.1 (95% CI: 1.4-3.1, p < 0.001). The highest prevalence of SIBO was observed in patients with spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) (57.7%, 95% CI 38.8-74.5), followed by patients with hepatic encephalopathy (41.0%, 95% CI 16.0-72.3) and patients with variceal bleed (39.5%, 95% CI 12.1-75.6). Overall, there is a significantly increased prevalence of SIBO in CLD patients compared to controls. The prevalence is even higher in CLD patients with PHT, especially those with SBP. This meta-analysis suggests that SIBO is associated with complications of CLD and potentially linked to the progression of CLD.

Despite its extensively employed in the pathogen diagnosis for various infectious diseases, its application in diagnosing stroke-related infection, and its potential impact on clinical decision-making, anti-infection treatment, clinical intervention, and patient prognosis remain insufficiently explored. Additionally, while mNGS offers promising potential, it facts limitations related to sensitivity, specificity, cost, and standardization, which could influence its integration into routine clinical practice. We retrospectively analyzed 18 stroke patients admitted to the First Affiliated Hospital of Medical College of Shantou University from January to February 2023, comparing culture-based methods with mNGS detection, and assessing its significance in etiological diagnosis. Additionally, we evaluated the performance differences among various sequencing platforms. Among the 18 stroke patients enrolled, pulmonary infections were identified in 7 cases, urinary tract infections in 1 case, central nervous system infections in 10 cases, and combined pulmonary and central nervous system infections in 2 cases, with 2 cases yielding negative results. mNGS detected pathogens in 13 cases, aligning with clinical diagnoses (75% concordance), whereas culture-based methods yielded positive results in only 6 cases (22% concordance). Importantly, for 9 of the 18 patients, adjustments to anti-infective treatment regimens based on mNGS results led to improved symptomatic relief and infection control. This suggests that mNGS can contribute to more timely and precise treatment modifications, particularly for infections with low pathogen loads, potentially enhancing clinical outcomes. Our findings highlights the utility of mNGS in diagnosing stroke-associated infections by providing a more comprehensive etiological diagnosis compared to traditional method. While mNGS shows promise in enhancing diagnostic accuracy and guiding clinical treatment, it high cost and technical challenges need addressing before widespread clinical adoption. Future research should focus on optimizing mNGS protocols, integration it with convertional diagnostic tools, and evaluating its cost-effectiveness and clinical impact through larger, multicentric studies.",Liang Y; Yang W; Xing Z,Department of Research and Development; Department of Diagnosis Technology Transformation; GeneMind Biosciences Company Limited,

At the time of analysis, 95 centers were included in the Amyloid Biomarker Study. The study included 9746 individuals with normal cognition (NC) and 3023 participants with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) aged between 34 and 100 years for whom data on amyloid biomarkers, presence of depressive symptoms, and age were available. Data were analyzed from December 2022 to February 2024. Amyloid-β1-42 levels in cerebrospinal fluid or amyloid positron emission tomography scans were used to determine presence or absence of amyloid pathology. Presence of depressive symptoms was determined on the basis of validated depression rating scale scores, evidence of a current clinical diagnosis of depression, or self-reported depressive symptoms.

When considering subgroup effects, in individuals with NC, the presence of depressive symptoms was associated with a higher frequency of amyloid pathology in APOE ε4 noncarriers (mean difference, 5.0%; 95% CI 1.0-9.0; P = .02) but not in APOE ε4 carriers. This was not the case in individuals with MCI. Depressive symptoms were not consistently associated with a higher frequency of amyloid pathology in participants with NC and were associated with a lower likelihood of amyloid pathology in participants with MCI. These findings were not influenced by age, sex, or education level.

The orfX gene cluster is also found in the genomes of many non-BoNT-producing bacteria, often alongside genes encoding oral insecticidal toxins. However, the functions of these OrfXs and P47 remain elusive. Here, we demonstrate that the combined action of all four components (OrfXs and P47) drastically boosts the oral toxicity of BoNT in mice, following proteolytic activation by digestive proteases that oral toxins regularly confront. In particular, OrfX2 adopts a self-inhibiting state, engaging with BoNT through another clostridial protein, nontoxic non-hemagglutinin (NTNH), only after proteolytic activation. Cryo-electron microscopy studies unveil that two molecules of protease-activated OrfX2 simultaneously associate with NTNH, a binding mode crucial for boosting BoNT oral toxicity. Collectively, these studies offer novel insights into the physiological functions and regulatory mechanisms of OrfXs and P47 of BoNTs, shedding light on the pathogenesis of other bacterial toxins associated with homologous OrfXs and P47.",,,miia.lindstrom@helsinki.fi.

Conditions such as type 2 diabetes (T2D), cardiovascular disease, obesity, depression, and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) increase AD risk and progression. This study aimed to examine the genetic predisposition to these conditions and their effect on AD pathophysiology, risk, and progression. A retrospective analysis was conducted using data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), a North American prospective cohort. Polygenic risk scores (PRSs) for OSA, T2D, coronary artery disease (CAD), major depression, and body mass index (BMI) were generated for 752 non-Hispanic White participants with whole-genome sequencing data. Logistic regression was used to evaluate associations between PRSs and progression from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to AD. Time to progression across PRS quartiles was analyzed using Cox proportional hazards models. PET amyloid and tau deposition rates, regional neocortical atrophy, and cognitive composite score declines were compared across OSA PRS quartiles using analysis of variance (ANOVA). Among 463 ADNI participants with baseline MCI (mean age 72.6 ± 7.3 years, 43.4% female), the OSA PRS, adjusted for BMI, was significantly associated with MCI-to-AD progression. The highest OSA PRS quartile had an odds ratio of 1.86 (95% CI 1.03-3.37) at 3 years and 2.02 (95% CI 1.16-3.51) at 5 years, compared with the lowest quartile. PRSs for T2D, CAD, major depression, and BMI were not associated with MCI-to-AD progression. Participants in the highest OSA PRS quartile had higher PET amyloid deposition and greater cognitive decline. In 752 participants (mean age 74.1 ± 7.3 years, 43.6% female), OSA PRS was significantly associated with baseline levels of PET amyloid, CSF amyloid-β 42, phosphorylated tau (p-tau), visinin-like protein 1, tumor necrosis factor receptor 1, and plasma neurofilament light after multiple testing adjustments. Individuals with high polygenic susceptibility to OSA exhibited an increased risk of MCI-to-AD progression and a higher amyloid deposition rate, suggesting potential modifier effects of OSA or OSA-associated genes on AD progression and pathophysiology. However, the small sample size and lack of objective OSA diagnosis limit interpretation of these genetic effects.",,,

This approach poses potential problems. First, a single drug or perhaps 2 drugs, in this case, may have been sufficient as initial and perhaps final treatment. Second, the prescriber cannot tell which drug(s) is/are producing either a beneficial or an ﻿adverse effect. This approach may stem from prescribers thinking that if they have made a diagnosis then they need to treat it with a drug labeled for or clinically used to treat that indication rather than taking a more conservative approach. However, such an approach adversely affects the ability to determine cause-and-effect relationships and hence adversely affects the ability to determine the best way to revise the treatment going forward.",Terry A,,

We aimed to quantify the impact of this suboptimal treatment on patient symptom incidence and severity, quality of life (QoL), and work impairment. Data were derived from the Adelphi Real World CD Disease Specific Programme, a cross-sectional survey of CD patients and their treating physicians in France, Germany, Italy, Spain, the United Kingdom, and the United States between January 2020 and March 2021. Physicians reported on patients' clinical history, disease status, symptom load, and treatment. Patients reported their QoL and activity impairment using the EQ-5D-5L and Work Productivity and Activity Impairment measures. Patients were divided into remitters, partial remitters, and non-remitters. Multivariate regression models were used to assess the impact of remission status on clinical and QoL outcomes. Of 1786 patients, 24.1% were remitters, 53.2% were partial remitters, and 22.7% were non-remitters. Partial remitters and non-remitters had a significantly higher symptom load than remitters ( Suboptimal treatment response was associated with increased symptoms and QoL burden.

This study aimed to isolate a novel ChoX-producing bacterial strain from whey samples. The most efficient strain was selected based on extracellular ChoX-producing ability and characterized as Escherichia fergusonii (E. fergusonii) through molecular and biochemical analysis. The maximum production of ChoX was obtained at the optimum condition of 48 h of incubation under shaking conditions (130 rpm) at 35 °C in a basal medium adjusted to pH 6.5, including 1.4 g/L cholesterol as a sole carbon. The crude product was purified by ammonium sulfate precipitation and followed by ion exchange chromatography utilizing Q-Sepharose, resulting in 5.35-fold and 13.86-fold purification, respectively, with a final specific activity of 15.8 U/mg. Additionally, molecular weight was determined by SDS-PAGE to be 49.0 kDa. The optimum conditions required for the higher cholesterol decomposition ability of purified ChoX were suggested to be 30 °C and pH 7.5 in the presence of MgSo Considering the properties of the extracted enzyme from E. fergusonii, it would be regarded as a potential ChoX source for commercial applications.",,,gdehghan@tabrizu.ac.ir.

In this study, we evaluated safety outcomes in 783 patients over more than 2,200 total patient-years of observation from 38 T cell therapy trials. The trials employed integrating gammaretroviral or lentiviral vectors to deliver engineered receptors to target HIV-1 infection or cancer. Eighteen patients (2.3%) developed secondary malignancies after treatment, with a median onset of 1.94 years (range: 51 d to 14 years). Where possible, incident tumor samples were analyzed for vector copy number, revealing no evidence of high-level marking or other indications of insertional mutagenesis. One T cell lymphoma was detected, but malignant T cells were not marked by vector integration. Analysis of vector integration sites in 176 patients revealed no pathological insertions linked to secondary malignancies, although, in some cases, integration in or near specific genes, including tumor suppressor genes, was associated with modest clonal expansion and sustained T cell persistence. These findings highlight the safety of engineered T cell therapies.",,,cjune@upenn.edu.

We aimed to explore the clinical significance of a new diagnosis of atrial fibrillation (AF) during follow-up. New AF was identified from hospitalization, study drug discontinuation, and adverse event reports. Multivariable Cox regression was used to determine risk factors for new AF. Time-updated covariate analysis was used to study the association of new AF with outcomes. During a mean follow-up of 23 months, 655 of 27,395 participants (2.4%) were diagnosed with AF (incidence, 1.3 per 100 patient-years). In adjusted analyses, advanced age, male sex, White ethnicity, higher body mass index, higher systolic blood pressure, heart failure, and prior myocardial infarction were associated with new AF. Compared with participants without a new diagnosis of AF during follow-up or before receiving a diagnosis of new AF, participants were at increased risk of a composite outcome of cardiovascular death, stroke, or myocardial infarction after a new diagnosis of AF (8.8 vs 2.4 per 100 patient-years; hazard ratio [HR], 3.66; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.81-4.75).

Ritlecitinib, a JAK3 and TEC kinase family inhibitor, has been approved for treatment of patients with AA and is in late-stage development for vitiligo. Ritlecitinib inhibits cytotoxic T cells, NK cells, and B cells which play a role in the pathogenesis of CeD. We aimed to explore the potential effect of ritlecitinib on CeD serology levels before and after ritlecitinib treatment in research participants of clinical trials. The effect of ritlecitinib on CeD serology (tTG-IgA, DGP-IgA/IgG) levels was retrospectively evaluated in participants from three phase 2 and one phase 3 ritlecitinib clinical trials including participants with active AA, rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and vitiligo, whose serum samples at baseline and post-treatment were available. All statistical comparisons of the changes between initial and follow-up samples used the Wilcoxon matched pairs exact test.

Here we show a specific means of mitochondrial respiratory complex I (CI) inhibition that improves tumor immunogenicity and sensitivity to immune checkpoint blockade (ICB). Targeted genetic deletion of either Ndufs4 or Ndufs6, but not other CI subunits, induces an immune-dependent growth attenuation in melanoma and breast cancer models. We show that deletion of Ndufs4 induces expression of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I co-activator Nlrc5 and antigen presentation machinery components, most notably H2-K1. This induction of MHC-related genes is driven by a pyruvate dehydrogenase-dependent accumulation of mitochondrial acetyl-CoA, which leads to an increase in histone H3K27 acetylation within the Nlrc5 and H2-K1 promoters. Taken together, this work shows that selective CI inhibition restricts tumor growth and that specific targeting of Ndufs4 or Ndufs6 increases T cell surveillance and ICB responsiveness.",,,pere_puigserver@dfci.harvard.edu.

However, rational drug design and in-depth mechanistic studies are urgently required for tumor sialic acid to become valuable glycoimmune targets. In this study, we explored the positive correlation of PD-L1 and sialyltransferase expression in clinical colorectal cancer tissues and identified their mutual regulation effects in macrophages. Subsequently, we characterized a new sialidase with excellent properties from human oral symbiotic bacteria and then developed a novel nanobody-enzyme fusion protein, designated as Nb16-Sia, to concurrently target the PD-L1 and sialic acid. Results from syngeneic colon tumor models reveal superior efficacy of Nb16-Sia over monotherapy and combinations, which could remodel the tumor immune microenvironment. Mechanistically, Nb16-Sia, which could repolarize macrophages from the tumor-promoting M2 to anti-tumor M1 phenotype via the C-type lectin pathway, exerted its antitumor efficacy mainly by regulating tumor-associated macrophages. Our strategy of nanobody-enzyme fusion protein effectively enables the delivery of sialidase, allows the collaboration between anti-PD-L1 nanobody and sialidase in combating tumors, and holds considerable promise for further development.",Chen C,Department of Research and Development,fmq@fudan.edu.cn.

This Commission sought to define clinical obesity as a condition of illness that, akin to the notion of chronic disease in other medical specialties, directly results from the effect of excess adiposity on the function of organs and tissues. The specific aim of the Commission was to establish objective criteria for disease diagnosis, aiding clinical decision making and prioritisation of therapeutic interventions and public health strategies. To this end, a group of 58 experts—representing multiple medical specialties and countries—discussed available evidence and participated in a consensus development process. Among these commissioners were people with lived experience of obesity to ensure consideration of patients’ perspectives. The Commission defines obesity as a condition characterised by excess adiposity, with or without abnormal distribution or function of adipose tissue, and with causes that are multifactorial and still incompletely understood. We define clinical obesity as a chronic, systemic illness characterised by alterations in the function of tissues, organs, the entire individual, or a combination thereof, due to excess adiposity. Clinical obesity can lead to severe end-organ damage, causing life-altering and potentially life-threatening complications (eg, heart attack, stroke, and renal failure). We define preclinical obesity as a state of excess adiposity with preserved function of other tissues and organs and a varying, but generally increased, risk of developing clinical obesity and several other non-communicable diseases (eg, type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, certain types of cancer, and mental disorders).

Yet while the efficacy of such adjuvant strategies has been shown to be highly time dependent, antiplatelet therapy at the acute phase of ischemic stroke cannot be envisioned until the diagnosis of stroke and its ischemic nature have been confirmed because of the presumed risk of worsening bleeding in case of intracranial hemorrhage (ICH). Here, we investigated this risk for 2 antiplatelet drugs currently being tested in clinical trials for ischemic stroke, glenzocimab and eptifibatide, in 2 mouse models of ICH. The severity of ICH was assessed in mice humanized for glycoprotein VI treated or not with glenzocimab or eptifibatide at effective dose, in a model of primary ICH caused by unilateral striatal injection of collagenase type VII, and in a model of hyperglycemia-induced hemorrhagic transformation of cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury. Glenzocimab had no impact on bleeding severity in either model of ICH. Conversely, eptifibatide caused a significant increase in intracranial bleeding in both models, and a drastic increase in death after hyperglycemia-induced hemorrhagic transformation of cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury.

As STING activation can upregulate programmed death ligand 1 and human leukocyte antigen in tumor cells, a combination of BI 1703880 and an anti-programmed cell death protein 1-antibody, such as ezabenlimab, may improve efficacy. This first-in-human phase Ia study (NCT05471856) is evaluating BI 1703880 plus ezabenlimab in patients with advanced solid tumors. The study utilizes an innovative lead-in design; all patients receive BI 1703880 monotherapy in Cycle 1 and combination therapy from Cycle 2. The primary endpoint is dose-limiting toxicities during the maximum tolerated dose evaluation period. Results will inform the future development of BI 1703880 for treatment of metastatic or recurrent malignancies. There are many different types of treatments available for patients with cancer. One type of treatment aims to use the patient’s own immune system to target and destroy the cancer, known as immunotherapy. BI 1703880 is a new drug that has been developed to activate the immune system for the treatment of cancer. This study is evaluating BI 1703880 for patients with advanced cancers based on its ability to destroy cancer cells in animal studies. BI 1703880 is being investigated on its own and in combination with another drug, ezabenlimab. The reason for testing these two drugs together is because sometimes cancer cells can become resistant to one type of immunotherapy, making proteins to “turn off” the immune response targeting the cancer. Similar to BI 1703880, ezabenlimab is also an immunotherapy. However, it turns the immune system on in a different way from BI 1703880, which means they may work together to produce a better anticancer result. The objective of the study is to determine a suitable dose of BI 1703880 alone and in combination with ezabenlimab and to see if any side effects occur.",Kitano S; Moreno I; Berz D; Fernandez N; Schmohl M; Barrueco J,Boehringer Ingelheim Pharmaceuticals Inc.; Boehringer Ingelheim España; Japanese Foundation for Cancer Research; START Madrid; Valkyrie Clinical Trials; Boehringer Ingelheim International GmbH,
39813296,MmuPV1 infection of Tmc6/Ever1 or Tmc8/Ever2 deficient FVB mice as a model of βHPV in typical epidermodysplasia verruciformis.,2025-05-01,PLoS pathogens,10.1371/journal.ppat.1012837,"Typical epidermodysplasia verruciformis (EV) is a rare, autosomal recessive disorder characterized by an unusual susceptibility to infection with specific skin-trophic types of human papillomavirus, principally betapapillomaviruses, and a propensity for developing malignant skin tumors in sun exposed regions. Its etiology reflects biallelic loss-of-function mutations in TMC6 (EVER1), TMC8 (EVER2) or CIB1. A TMC6-TMC8-CIB1 protein complex in the endoplasmic reticulum is hypothesized to be a restriction factor in keratinocytes for βHPV infection. However, the complex is also present in lymphocytes and its loss may compromise cellular immune control of βHPV infection. Indeed, certain primary immunodeficiencies, iatrogenic immunosuppression and AIDS are associated with the atypical form of EV. While well controlled in immunocompetent mice, murine papillomavirus MmuPV1 was first isolated from immunodeficient mice with florid skin warts, modeling atypical EV. To examine their potential as a model of typical EV, Tmc6-/-, Tmc8-/- or wildtype FVB mice were challenged with MmuPV1. At day 16 post vaginal challenge with MmuPV1, the levels of viral transcripts were similar in Tmc6-/- and Tmc8-/- mice and wildtype FVB mice, arguing against Tmc6/8 acting as intracellular restriction factors. Thereafter, greater clearance of MmuPV1 by the wildtype that the Tmc6-/- and Tmc8-/- FVB mice was evident, supporting the hypothesis that typical EV reflects a subtle cellular immune deficit. Indeed, Tmc6-/- or Tmc8-/- mice exhibit partial CD8 T cell deficits and elevated Treg. While interferon-γ production and surface CD25 were similarly elevated in CD8 T cells upon in vitro stimulation with anti-CD3/CD28, the fraction of Tmc6-/- or Tmc8-/- CD8 T cells that were dividing was lower compared to wildtype. Typical EV patients exhibit normal control of most viral infections; Tmc6-/-, Tmc8-/- and wildtype FVB mice similarly controlled vaccinia virus after skin challenge and induced neutralizing antibodies.",Mellinger-Pilgrim R; Best S,Department of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery,

Utilizing an optimal transport approach, we conducted graph-based mapping of transcriptomic profiles to transfer AD subtype labels from ROSMAP monocyte samples to ADNI and ANMerge peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Subsequently, differential expression followed by comparative pathway and diffusion pseudotime analysis were applied to each cohort to infer the progression trajectories. Survival analysis with real follow-up time was used to obtain potential biomarkers for AD prognosis. AD subtype labels were accurately transferred onto the blood samples of ADNI and ANMerge living patients. Pathways and associated genes in neutrophil degranulation-like immune process, immune acute phase response, and IL-6 signaling were significantly associated with AD progression. The work enhanced our understanding of AD progression in different subtypes, offering insights into potential biomarkers and personalized interventions for improved patient care. We applied an innovative optimal transport-based approach to map transcriptomic data from different Alzheimer's disease (AD) cohort studies and transfer known AD subtype labels from ROSMAP monocyte samples to peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) samples within ADNI and ANMerge cohorts. Through comprehensive trajectory and comparative analysis, we investigated the molecular mechanisms underlying different disease progression trajectories in AD. We validated the accuracy of our AD subtype label transfer and identified prognostic genetic markers associated with disease progression, facilitating personalized treatment strategies.

Recent studies highlight the growing interest in targeting and blocking the activity of YKL-40 to treat cancer. Some of those targeting-strategies have been developed to directly block the heparin-affinity of YKL-40 with promising results. This study explores how short chain chitooligosaccharides (ChOS) affect the heparin-binding affinity of YKL-40. Our findings reveal that ChOS act as allosteric effectors, decreasing the heparin-binding affinity of YKL-40 in a size- and dose-dependent manner. Our results provide insights into the heparin affinity of YKL-40 and how ChOS can be used to target the heparin activity of YKL-40 in diseases. Since ChOS has many beneficial properties, such as being non-toxic and biodegradable, these results provide intriguing opportunities for applying them as allosteric effectors of the heparin-binding affinity of YKL-40.",Magnusdottir U; Kjalarsdottir L; Gislason J; Einarsson JM,Genis hf,

Considering the therapeutic paradigm shift with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) now approved in the first-line setting, we present an updated immunogenomic analysis of patients enrolled in BERIL-1, including patients with immune-infiltrated tumors. The objective of this study was to identify biomarkers predictive of treatment efficacy in the context of the post-ICI therapeutic landscape. Genomic analyses were performed at baseline on tumor and/or plasma circulating DNA (ctDNA) samples, and immunohistochemistry (IHC) studies, including immune infiltration [tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) and CD8 expression], were performed on tumor samples. Immunogenomic biomarkers were correlated to overall survival (OS). Among 158 patients enrolled in BERIL-1, either tumor (53.2%; n = 84) or ctDNA samples (70.8%; n = 112) were available in 85.4% (n = 135). The most commonly mutated genes were TP53 (57.0%), NOTCH1 (23.7%), and PIK3CA (22.2%). In the IHC studies, 98.6% (n = 68/69) of patients were TILs positive in the buparlisib arm versus 94.4% (n = 68/72) in the placebo arm. In patients with TILs-positive tumors, enrichment for clinical benefit on the buparlisib arm was seen in those with PIK3 pathway activation [25.0% (n = 17/68)] with a hazard ratio (HR) for death of 0.43 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.21-0.87, p = 0.016]. Similarly, improved OS was seen in patients on the buparlisib arm and NOTCH pathway activation [20.5% (n = 14/68)] with a HR for death of 0.40 (95% CI 0.18-0.90, p = 0.022). Both associations were absent in the placebo group. TP53 and tumor mutational burden (TMB) did not correlate with OS in the buparlisib or placebo arms. In this immunogenomic analysis of BERIL-1, improved HRs for OS were seen in patients with tumor immune infiltration and selected oncogenic alterations, including PIK3 and NOTCH pathway activation (NCT01852292).",Lucas J; Lu S; Tse A; Tang T; Dreyer K; He N; Birgerson LE; Faivre S,Hôpital St-Louis; Adlai Nortye,antoine.desilets@umontreal.ca.

Evidence on the cost-effectiveness of exercise for patients with mBC is essential for implementation in clinical practice and is currently lacking. A cost-utility analysis was performed alongside the multinational PREFERABLE-EFFECT randomized controlled trial, conducted in 8 centers across Europe and Australia. Patients with mBC (N = 357) were randomly assigned to either a 9-month, twice-weekly, supervised exercise group (EG) or control group (CG). Costs of the exercise program were calculated through a bottom-up approach. Other health care resource use, productivity losses, and quality of life were collected using country-adapted, self-reported questionnaires. Analyses were conducted from a societal perspective with a time horizon of 9 months. Costs were collected and reported in 2021 Euros (€1 = $1.18 US dollars). Compared with the CG, EG resulted in a quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gain of 0.013 (95% CI, -0.02 to 0.05) over a 9-month period. The mean costs of the exercise program were €1,696 per patient with one-on-one supervision (scenario 1) and €609 with one-on-four supervision (scenario 2). These costs were offset by savings in health care and productivity costs, resulting in mean total cost differences of -€163 (scenario 1) and -€1,249 (scenario 2) in favor of EG. The probability of supervised exercise being cost-effective was 65% in scenario 1 and 91% in scenario 2 at a willingness-to-pay threshold of €20,000 per QALY. Exercise for patients with mBC increases quality of life, decreases costs, and is likely to be cost-effective. Group-based supervision is expected to have even higher cost-savings. Our positive findings can inform reimbursement of supervised exercise interventions for patients with mBC.",Belloso J; Lahuerta A; Kufel-Grabowska J; Urruticoechea A,Gipuzkoa Cancer Unit; Greater Poland Cancer Centre,

Patients with advanced KRASG12C-mutant NSCLC treated with adagrasib [KRYSTAL-1 (NCT03785249)] were included in the analysis. Pretreatment next-generation sequencing data were collected per protocol. HTG EdgeSeq Transcriptome Panel was used for gene expression profiling. Clinical endpoints included objective response, progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS). KRASG12C-mutant NSCLC cell lines and xenograft models were used for sensitivity analyses and combination drug screens. KEAP1 MUT and STK11MUT were associated with shorter survival to adagrasib [KEAP1: PFS 4.1 vs. 9.9 months, HR 2.7, P < 0.01; OS 5.4 vs. 19.0 months, HR 3.6, P < 0.01; STK11: PFS 4.2 vs. 11.0 months, HR 2.2, P < 0.01; OS 9.8 months vs. not reached (NR), HR 2.6, P < 0.01]. KEAP1WT/STK11WT status identified adagrasib-treated patients with significantly longer PFS (16.9 months) and OS (NR). Preclinical analyses further validate the association between KEAP1 loss of function and adagrasib resistance. Adagrasib and mTOR inhibitor combinations produced higher treatment efficacy in NSCLC models harboring STK11 and KEAP1 co-mutations. NRF2HIGH signaling was associated with shorter survival to adagrasib (PFS: 4.2 vs. 8.4 months, HR 2.0, P = 0.02; OS: 6.5 vs. 19.0 months, HR 2.8, P < 0.01) even in patients with KEAP1WT NSCLC.

KEAP1, STK11, and NRF2 status define patients with KRASG12C-mutant NSCLC with markedly distinct outcomes to adagrasib.

The objective of this study was to assess efficacy and safety of blarcamesine (ANAVEX®2-73), an orally available small-molecule activator of the sigma-1 receptor (SIGMAR1) in early AD through restoration of cellular homeostasis including autophagy enhancement. ANAVEX2-73-AD-004 was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 48-week Phase IIb/III trial. Multicenter - 52 medical research centers/hospitals in 5 countries. 508 participants with early AD (Stage 3) were randomized to receive either blarcamesine (n = 338) in medium dose group 30 mg or in high dose group 50 mg or placebo (n = 170) oral capsules once daily for 48 weeks. Participants in these groups were offered to enroll into the open-label-extension study ATTENTION-AD, which completed June 2024, ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier NCT04314934. The co-primary cognitive and functional outcomes were assessed as change in ADAS-Cog13 and ADCS-ADL from baseline to 48 weeks. The outcomes include the secondary outcome CDR-SB and biomarkers from the A/T/N spectrum, plasma Aβ42/40-ratio and global brain volume changes measured by MRI. All clinical endpoints were analyzed using mixed model for repeated measures (MMRM), plasma biomarker measurements were analyzed by Welch's t-test, and volumetric MRI scans were analyzed by general linear model. Among 462 randomized participants in the intent-to-treat population (mean age, 73.7 years; 225 [48.7%] women), 338 (73.2%) completed the trial. The co-primary outcome was met under the multiplicity control rule, since the differences in the least-squares mean (LSM) change from baseline to 48 weeks between the prespecified blarcamesine and placebo groups for ADAS-Cog13 was significant at a level of P < 0.025 and for CDR-SB was significant at a level of P < 0.025, while ADCS-ADL did not reach significance at Week 48 (ADAS-Cog13 difference of -2.027 [95% CI -3.522 to -0.533]; P = 0.008; CDR-SB difference of -0.483 [95% CI -0.853 to -0.114]; P = 0.010; ADCS-ADL difference of 0.775 [95%CI -0.874 to 2.423]; P = 0.357). Plasma Aβ42/40-ratio increased significantly with blarcamesine group vs. placebo, (P = 0.048) and whole brain volume loss was significantly decreased (P = 0.002). Participants in the full safety population with ≥1 serious treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) occurred in 56 participants (16.7%) in the blarcamesine and 17 (10.1%) in the placebo group. Common TEAEs included dizziness, which was transient and mostly mild to moderate in severity. One death in the blarcamesine group and 1 in the placebo group were both not considered treatment related. Blarcamesine, demonstrating a safety profile with no associated neuroimaging adverse events, significantly slowed clinical progression by 36.3% at 48 weeks with blarcamesine group as well as the individual 30 mg (by 34.6%) and 50 mg (by 38.5%) blarcamesine groups vs. placebo on the prespecified primary cognitive endpoint ADAS-Cog13. The prespecified secondary endpoint CDR-SB, which is used as the sole primary endpoint in recent successful AD drug submissions, is significantly improved at Week 48 with blarcamesine relative to placebo. The findings are supported by biomarkers from the A/T/N spectrum, including plasma Aβ42/40-ratio and reduction of whole brain atrophy. Additionally, the prespecified SIGMAR1 gene variant subgroup analysis confirmed beneficial clinical effect of blarcamesine group through upstream SIGMAR1 activation - subjects with the common SIGMAR1 wild-type gene (excluding carriers of the mutated SIGMAR1 rs1800866 variant) experienced an even greater significant clinical benefit with slowed clinical progression by 49.8% at 48 weeks on the prespecified primary cognitive endpoint ADAS-Cog13.

Among the natural therapies, proanthocyanidins (PACs), which can treat a wide range of immune-mediated inflammatory diseases (IMIDs), have been shown to play an important role in the treatment of pathologies concerning prostate health. In this regard, the present study aimed to evaluate the different bioactivities of a grape seed extract (GSE), rich in polymeric PACs, and its version processed under alkaline conditions (ATGSE), characterized by a higher content of oligomeric PACs, in an animal model of BPH induced by subcutaneous injection of testosterone (1 mg/mouse).

39796338,AbaComplex Enhances Mitochondrial Biogenesis and Adipose Tissue Browning: Implications for Obesity and Glucose Regulation.,,"Foods (Basel, Switzerland)",10.3390/foods14010048,"Adipose tissue, particularly white adipose tissue (WAT), plays a central role in energy storage and metabolic regulation. Excess WAT, especially visceral fat, is strongly linked to metabolic disorders such as obesity and type 2 diabetes. The browning of WAT, whereby white fat cells acquire characteristics of brown adipose tissue (BAT) with enhanced thermogenic capacity, represents a promising strategy to enhance metabolic health. In this study, we investigated the effects of chronic supplementation with an infusion based on lyophilized, thin nectarines rich in abscisic acid (ABA), named AbaComplex, on promoting browning of WAT and activating BAT in mice. Over 30 days, C57BL/6 mice were treated with the ABA-rich infusion, and various metabolic and molecular parameters were assessed. The results showed that the AbaComplex significantly increased the expression of browning markers, such as UCP1 and PGC1-α, in both visceral and subcutaneous WAT. Additionally, mitochondrial biogenesis and function were enhanced, evidenced by elevated mitochondrial DNA content and activity. The treatment also reduced the weight of WAT (both visceral and subcutaneous) and BAT and significantly improved glucose uptake in WAT via upregulation of GLUT4, suggesting enhanced insulin sensitivity. Overall, the pronounced browning effect in WAT underscores the potential of AbaComplex as a natural approach for combating obesity and improving metabolic health.",,,

However, the molecular basis of exceptional response (ER) to immunotherapy in metastatic clear cell renal cell carcinoma (mccRCC) has not been well characterized. Here we analyzed pretherapy genomic and transcriptomic data in treatment-naive persons with mccRCC treated with standard-of-care immunotherapies: (1) combination of programmed cell death protein and ligand 1 (PD1/PDL1) and cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated protein 4 inhibitors (IO/IO) or (2) combination of PD1/PDL1 and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptor inhibitors (IO/VEGF). In the IO/IO cohort, clonal neoantigen load was significantly higher in persons with ER. In the IO/VEGF cohort, ER participants displayed strong enrichment of B cell receptor signaling-related pathways, tertiary lymphoid structure (TLS) signatures and evidence of increased metabolic activity. Our results suggest that ER may be related to clonal neoantigen-driven cytotoxic T cell responses and TLS formation in tumor microenvironments.

Antigen detection of tumor markers is one of the important diagnostic methods for HCC. However, Traditional antigen detection methods often rely on heavy detection equipment, involve lengthy turnaround times, and must be conducted in laboratory settings. Therefore, there is a clear need for a portable, low-skill, rapid sample-to-result detection method for early HCC biomarkers. We propose a new platform based on electrowetting-on-dielectric digital microfluidic(EWOD-DMF) for the detection of early-stage HCC biomarkers, enabling the quantitative measurement of Alpha-Fetoprotein (AFP), the proportion of AFP-L3 in total AFP (AFP-L3%), and Des-Gamma-Carboxy Prothrombin (DCP). First, serum samples are processed through the microfluidic system, achieving the separation of AFP-L3 within 10 min. Next, immunoassays are performed within 15 min, using magnetic particles to capture biomarkers such as AFP, AFP-L3, and DCP, followed by enzymatic reactions that generate detectable signals. Each chip can simultaneously detect three biomarkers from five different samples, allowing for a total of fifteen targets to be tested, with only approximately 2.4 μL of serum required for each biomarker detection. Ultimately, data are analyzed with dedicated software to quantitatively measure the HCC biomarkers. The detection limits for AFP or AFP-L3 and for DCP are 0.24 ng/mL and 1.89 ng/mL, respectively. This study presents a EWOD-DMF platform for early-stage HCC diagnosis, capable of simultaneously detecting multiple samples and biomarkers, thus improving detection efficiency and diagnostic accuracy. Moreover, the platform has POCT capability, with advantages in portability and cost-effectiveness, providing clinicians and primary healthcare institutions with a fast and convenient solution for early-stage HCC diagnosis.",Xia W; Wang X; Jin J; Wang X,Department of Molecular Diagnostics; Nanjing RealMind Biotech Co.,chenying@xzhmu.edu.cn.

However, mTOR inhibitors, such as temsirolimus, have modest clinical benefits. In addition to inducing metabolic changes in cells, metformin activates AMPK, which in turn inhibits the mTOR pathway. In this phase 1 clinical trial we hypothesized that combining metformin with temsirolimus would potentiate the antitumor activity against advanced or recurrent endometrial cancer. The dose-expansion cohort used a Simon Minimax two-stage design. The objectives of the endometrial cancer expansion cohort were to evaluate the clinical tumor response, as indicated by the objective response and clinical benefit rates, as well as an ongoing safety assessment of the combination treatment. Forty patients were enrolled in this study. The most common treatment-related adverse events (reported in 32 patients) were hypertriglyceridemia (n = 14), diarrhea (n = 13), mucositis (n = 13), anorexia (n = 12), and anemia (n = 10). The grade 3 adverse events were 2 instances each of anemia and thrombocytopenia and 1 instance each of mucositis, fatigue, weight loss, hypokalemia, hypophosphatemia, and increased aspartate aminotransferase and alanine transaminase levels. Among the 33 patients evaluable for response, objective response was seen in two (6 %; both partial responses), and 13 (39 %) patients had stable disease, including 11 for ≥4 months, representing a clinical benefit rate of 39 %.

In patients with systemic atherosclerosis, a significant reduction of stroke risk with no increase in intracranial or fatal hemorrhage was seen when rivaroxaban 2.5 mg twice daily was added to aspirin. However, there are no trials in ICAD using this combination. To facilitate the design of future ICAD trials, the CATIS-ICAD study (Combination Antithrombotic Treatment for Prevention of Recurrent Ischemic Stroke in Intracranial Atherosclerotic Disease) assessed (1) the feasibility of recruitment, (2) the safety of low-dose rivaroxaban plus aspirin compared with standard-of-care antiplatelet therapy, and (3) trends toward efficacy. This was a prospective, randomized, open-label, blinded end point pilot trial conducted in 10 Canadian centers. Eligible participants aged ≥40 years, with acute ischemic stroke or high-risk transient ischemic attack, were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive low-dose rivaroxaban plus aspirin or aspirin alone within 7 to 100 days of their index event. The primary safety outcome was hemorrhagic stroke. The main efficacy end point was the composite of ischemic stroke or covert brain infarct on magnetic resonance imaging at the end of the study. A total of 101 participants were randomized. Average enrollment was 10 participants/site per year. Average follow-up was 20 months. Median time from index stroke to randomization was 67 days. The median age of participants was 67 years (±10.94), and 29% of participants were women. There was no hemorrhagic stroke in either arm.

Targeting endothelial cells and related signaling pathways can improve the effectiveness of immunotherapy by normalizing tumor blood vessels and promoting immune cell infiltration. However, to date, there have been no comprehensive studies analyzing the role of endothelial cells in the diagnosis and treatment of prostate adenocarcinoma (PRAD). By integrating clinical and transcriptomic data from TCGA-PRAD, we initially identified key endothelial cell-related genes in PRAD samples through single-cell analysis. Subsequently, cluster analysis was employed to classify PRAD samples based on the expression of these endothelial cell-related genes, allowing us to explore their correlation with patient prognosis and immunotherapy outcomes. A diagnostic model was then constructed and validated using a combination of 108 machine learning algorithms. The XGBoost and Random Forest algorithms highlighted the significant role of COL1A1, and we further analyzed the expression and correlation of COL1A1, AR, and EGFR through multiplex immunofluorescence staining. In vitro experimental analysis of the impact of COL1A1 on the progression of PRAD. Single-cell analysis identified 12 differential prognostic genes associated with endothelial cells. Cluster analysis confirmed a strong correlation between endothelial cell-related genes and both prostate cancer prognosis and immunotherapy responses. Diagnostic models developed using various machine learning techniques demonstrated the significant predictive capability of these 12 genes in the diagnosis of prostate cancer. Furthermore, based on patients' prognostic information, multiple machine learning analyses highlighted the critical role of COL1A1. Immunofluorescence analysis results confirmed that COL1A1 is highly expressed in prostate cancer and is positively correlated with both AR and EGFR. In vitro experiments confirm that reducing COL1A1 expression levels can inhibit PRAD progression.

This evidence is important to inform current treatment and provide a benchmark for emergent targeted KRAS therapies in metastatic PDAC. To assess the clinical implications of common KRAS G12 mutations in PDAC and to compare outcomes of standard-of-care multiagent therapies across these common mutations. This retrospective cohort study obtained deidentified clinical data for 5382 patients from a nationwide (US-based) clinicogenomic database. The deidentified data originated from approximately 280 US cancer clinics (approximately 800 sites of care). Patients diagnosed with metastatic PDAC from February 9, 2010, to September 20, 2022, and with sufficient follow-up and treatment data were included. Median overall survival (OS) and time to next treatment (TTNT) were calculated for each KRAS mutation group. Hazard ratios (HRs) were generated using multivariate Cox proportional hazards models for KRAS mutations and mutation-treatment combinations. A total of 2433 patients with PDAC were included in the analysis (mean age at first treatment, 67.0 [range, 66.0-68.0] years; 1340 male [55.1%]).

During the COVID-19 pandemic, consistent autumn-winter movement waves from Southeastern Asia to temperate regions were interrupted for both subtype/lineages, however the A/H1N1 pandemic only disrupted A/H3N2 spread. We find a higher persistence of A/H3N2 than B/Victoria circulation in Southeastern Asia and identify distinct pandemic-related disruptions in A/H3N2 antigenic evolution between two pandemics, compared to interpandemic levels; similar patterns are observed in B/Victoria using genetic distance. The internal movement structure within Southeastern Asia markedly diverged during the COVID-19 pandemic season, and to a lesser extent, during the 2009 A/H1N1 pandemic season.

To date, current treatment options primarily involve various chemotherapies, which often prove ineffective and are associated with substantial toxicity. Furthermore, immunotherapies utilizing checkpoint inhibitors have shown limited efficacy in this context, highlighting an urgent need for novel therapeutic strategies. This study investigates the preclinical efficacy of an innovative targeted therapy based on antibody-cytokine fusion proteins, specifically interleukin-2 (IL-2), a pivotal driver of cell-mediated immunity, fused to L19 antibody, which selectively binds to extra domain B of fibronectin (EDB-FN1) expressed in the tumor microenvironment. We tested the effectiveness of different immunocytokines through in vivo characterization in syngeneic C57BL/6J orthotopic mouse models of PDAC. Based on these results, we decided to focus on L19-IL2. To assess the efficacy of this immunocytokine we developed an ex-vivo immune-spheroid interaction platform derived from murine 3D pancreatic cultures, and telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) specific T-lymphocytes. Moreover, we evaluated the anti-cancer effect of L19-IL2 in combination with standard therapy in vivo experiments in PDAC mouse models. Tumor samples collected after the treatments were characterized for tumor infiltrating immune cell components by bulk RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) and spatial transcriptomics (Stereo-seq) analysis. The tumor-targeted L19-IL2 fusion protein demonstrated potent, dose-dependent anti-tumor activity in mice with pancreatic tumors resistant to standard chemotherapy. Spatial Transcriptomics (ST) and RNA-seq analyses indicated that L19-IL2 treatment induced a significant influx of immune cells into the tumor microenvironment, with these cells expressing activation markers like granzymes, perforins, and the IL-2 receptors. Our results demonstrated that L19-IL2 enhances immune infiltration and cytotoxicity, remodeling the ""cold"" tumor microenvironment (TME) in PDAC.

In this article, the authors evaluate the applications of scanning electron microscopy (SEM) examination to impression cytology (IC) of the bulbar conjunctiva for the assessment of microvillar alteration as an early ultrastructural indicator of ocular surface health. This method offers several advantages, starting with its simplicity: it involves the non-invasive application of a strip of bibulous paper to the bulbar or tarsal conjunctiva. Unlike conjunctival or corneal biopsies, which are surgical procedures, this technique is far less invasive and more comfortable for the patient. It also provides a more clinically relevant in vivo assessment compared to studies on cultured cell lines, which are mostly limited to scientific research and may not accurately reflect real-world conditions. This makes it an effective, repeatable, and patient-friendly option for detecting early pathological alterations of the ocular surface. It also represents a useful tool for evaluating the efficacy of topical drugs and the toxic effects of external factors and ophthalmic or systemic diseases. Finally, it allows for obtaining accessory information relating to goblet cells, the presence of inflammatory infiltrate, or any pathogens.",Del Prete S; Marasco D,Service Biotech s.r.l.,

There remains a pressing need for more effective treatment options that can prolong survival and enhance the quality of life of patients with EOC. In contrast to the significant benefits of immunotherapy with immune checkpoint inhibitors (CPI) seen in many solid tumors, initial experience in EOC suggests limited efficacy of CPIs monotherapy. A systematic review of phase III studies testing the role of CPIs in ovarian cancer was performed. Seven randomized trials testing CPIs in newly diagnosed (n = 3) and recurrent (n = 4) EOC are evaluated. Overall, those trials included data of 5671 patients. Single-agent PD-L1 inhibitor trials have not shown significant efficacy in newly diagnosed ovarian cancer. Triplet maintenance with bevacizumab plus olaparib and durvalumab is associated with longer progression-free survival than maintenance with bevacizumab alone in patients without tumor BRCA mutations. CPIs were not effective in platinum-sensitive (n = 1031) and platinum-resistant (n = 1420) EOC. The value of adding CPI to standard treatment including poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors with or without bevacizumab remains unclear and is being addressed in ongoing clinical trials. The combination of cytotoxic T-lymphocyte associated protein 4 (CTLA-4) and programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) inhibitors may enhance the efficacy of immunotherapy in EOC and studies are underway to investigate the combination of CPI with other emerging treatment modalities.

The specific combination of the molecular properties of antisense technology and mRNA therapy with functional RNA secondary structures allowed us to develop selectively expressed RNA molecules for medical applications. These seRNAs remain inactive in non-target cells and induce translation by partial degradation only in preselected cell types of interest. Cell specificity and type of functionalization are easily adaptable based on a modular system. In proof-of-concept studies we use seRNAs as platform technology for highly selective cell targeting.

Tau forms large insoluble aggregates that are toxic to neurons in several neurological disorders, and neurofibrillary Tau tangles represent a key pathological hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other tauopathies. Lowering Tau expression levels constitutes a potential treatment for AD but the mechanisms that regulate Tau expression at the transcriptional or translational level are not well understood. Natural antisense transcripts (NATs) are a particular class of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) that can regulate expression of their overlapping protein-coding genes at the epigenetic, transcriptional, or translational level. We and others identified a long non-coding RNA associated with the MAPT gene, named MAPT antisense 1 (MAPT-AS1). We confirmed that MAPT-AS1 is expressed in neurons in human post mortem brain tissue. To study the role of MAPT-AS1 on MAPT expression regulation, we modulated the expression of this lncRNA in human neuroblastoma cell lines and in human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) derived neurons. In contrast to previous reports, we observed no changes on MAPT mRNA or Tau protein levels upon modulation of MAPT-AS1 levels in these cellular models. Our data suggest that MAPT-AS1 does not regulate Tau expression levels in human neurons in vitro.

The relationship between measures of CFTR function, such as sweat chloride concentration, and clinical outcomes in pwCF treated with CFTR modulators is poorly defined. We conducted analyses to better understand the relationships between sweat chloride and CFTR function in vitro, and between sweat chloride and clinical outcomes following CFTR modulator treatment. Mean sweat chloride values in healthy people, CF carriers, and pwCF treated with CFTR modulators at different doses were compared to chloride transport in corresponding human bronchial epithelial (HBE) cells. A pooled analysis of phase 3 CFTR modulator studies was performed to evaluate the relationship between attained values of sweat chloride and improvements in lung function, body mass index (BMI), patient reported outcomes, pulmonary exacerbations, and lung function change over time. Sweat chloride concentrations in vivo correlated strongly with CFTR-dependent chloride current in HBE cells in vitro. Sweat chloride values of <30 mmol/L and ≥30 to <60 mmol/L in pwCF following CFTR modulator treatment were associated with better clinical outcomes than sweat chloride ≥60 to <80 mmol/L and ≥80 mmol/L. In pwCF treated with CFTR modulators, lower sweat chloride levels (reflecting greater CFTR function) are associated with better clinical outcomes. These results support the therapeutic strategy of further restoring CFTR function towards normal, as reflected in lowering sweat chloride to below the diagnostic threshold for CF (<60 mmol/L) and to normal (<30 mmol/L), with CFTR modulators.",Fajac I; Taylor-Cousar JL; Nair N; Zhu J; Arteaga-Solis E; Van Goor F; McGarry L; Prieto-Centurion V; Sosnay PR; Bozic C; Waltz D,APHP Université Paris Cité; Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated; Departments of Internal Medicine and Pediatrics,edith.zemanick@childrenscolorado.org.

Using icORR as a surrogate for overall survival (OS) has prompted use of alternate response criteria. To set the stage for harmonized MBM trials, the aim of this exploratory analysis was to determine icORR using several response criteria and examine correlations of response with survival. Patients (N = 119) with ≥one unirradiated MBMs received nivolumab + ipilimumab every 3 weeks (four doses), followed by nivolumab every 2 weeks for ≤24 months. Blinded review icORR was assessed with modified RECIST (mRECIST), Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology Brain Metastases (RANO-BM; 5 mm and 10 mm cutoffs), and volumetric criteria (5 mm and 10 mm). Using a 6-week response landmark, IC progression-free survival (icPFS) and OS were compared for responders versus nonresponders. icORR was higher with mRECIST and volumetric criteria than with RANO-BM or RECIST. mRECIST and volumetric response also showed stronger correlations with icPFS and OS. mRECIST responders who were RANO-BM 5 mm nonresponders (n = 14) had similar OS to RANO-BM 5 mm responders (n = 41). Clinical deterioration affected RANO-BM icORR; however, when assessed only radiographically without deterioration, RANO-BM 5 mm performed similarly to mRECIST. Among 41 patients with target lesions all <10 mm, responder icPFS and OS were similar to those of responders in the total population, indicating that response could be accurately determined in these patients. This analysis supports mRECIST or radiographic-only RANO-BM 5 mm as reliable assessment scales in MBM trials. Volumetric response correlated with survival, supporting its application in future trials.

Intratumor heterogeneity is a known cause of targeted therapy resistance and is considered a major factor in treatment failure. This study identifies clones of EGFR-mutant non-small cell lung tumors expressing low levels of both wild-type and mutant EGFR protein. These EGFR-low cells are intrinsically more tolerant to EGFR inhibitors, more invasive, and exhibit an epithelial-to-mesenchymal-like phenotype compared to their EGFR-high counterparts. The EGFR-low cells secrete Transforming growth factor beta (TGFβ) family cytokines, leading to increased recruitment of cancer-associated fibroblasts and immune suppression, thus contributing to the drug-tolerant tumor microenvironment. Notably, pharmacological induction of EGFR using epigenetic inhibitors sensitizes the resistant cells to EGFR inhibition.

Exercise enhances metabolic flexibility, making it an important tool for discovering mechanisms that promote metabolic health. Here we show that pantothenate kinase 4 (PanK4) is a new conserved exercise target with high abundance in muscle. Muscle-specific deletion of PanK4 impairs fatty acid oxidation which is related to higher intramuscular acetyl-CoA and malonyl-CoA levels. Elevated acetyl-CoA levels persist regardless of feeding state and are associated with whole-body glucose intolerance, reduced insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in glycolytic muscle, and impaired glucose uptake during exercise. Conversely, increasing PanK4 levels in glycolytic muscle lowers acetyl-CoA and enhances glucose uptake.

Primary objectives were to evaluate safety and tolerability and determine the recommended phase 2 dose/schedule (RP2D). Secondary objectives included the assessment of efficacy and characterization of the pharmacokinetics of rimiducid. Thirty-three patients received BPX-601 with or without rimiducid, 24 patients with mPDAC and 9 with mCRPC. Two dose-limiting toxicities and two treatment-related deaths occurred in the highest-dose mCRPC cohort, after which the study was terminated, without determination of the RP2D. Two mCRPC patients experienced partial responses (one unconfirmed), and 56% of mCRPC patients achieved ≥50% reduction in prostate-specific antigen. BPX-601 cell expansion, long-term persistence in peripheral blood, and tumor infiltration were observed. Rimiducid increased circulating inflammatory cytokines/chemokines consistent with GoCAR-T® cell activation. These results suggest that pharmacological activation of GoCAR-T® cells is feasible and may offer a promising avenue to control chimeric antigen receptor-T cell activity with continued dose-optimization to improve tolerability.",Jacquemont CF; Senesac JH; Bayle JH; Scripture CD,Bellicum Pharmaceuticals,eeileana@mdanderson.org.

Here we conduct a barcode-seq-based comparison of 47 AAV capsids administered through different routes in mice, followed by individual validation. We find that local delivery of AAV-KP1, but not AAV9, via the renal vein or pelvis effectively transduces proximal tubules with minimal off-target liver transduction, while systemic AAV9, but not AAV-KP1, enhances proximal tubule and podocyte transduction in chronic kidney disease. We demonstrate that these contrasting observations are partly due to differences in their pharmacokinetics. Importantly, we show that renal pelvis injection overcomes pre-existing immunity, leading to robust and exclusive proximal tubule transduction, in non-human primates (NHPs). In addition, we highlight drastic differences in renal transduction profiles between mice and NHPs. Thus, this study provides mechanistic insights and underscores importance of context-dependent selection of AAV capsids to overcome challenges in gene delivery to the kidney.",,,nakaih@ohsu.edu.

However, wild-type mice are not susceptible to COVID-19 infection due to the low affinity of mouse ACE2, the entry protein for SARS-CoV-2. Although mice with human ACE2 (hACE2) driven by Ace2 promoter reflect its tissue specificity, these animals exhibit low ACE2 expression, potentially limiting their fidelity in mimicking COVID-19 manifestations and their utility in viral studies. Here, we created and compared hACE2 mouse models generated with different strategies. Our findings show that distinct β-globin insertion within hACE2 cassette significantly influences its expression, with downstream placement enhancing transcription. Moreover, optimizing hACE2 codons (opt-hACE2) improves translation efficiency in multiple tissues. Notably, opt-hACE2 mice displayed more active immune responses and severe COVID-19 phenotypes following SARS-CoV-2 challenge compared to other models. Our study demonstrates the dual regulatory role of β-globin element in transgene transcription and suggests that opt-hACE2 mice might serve as valuable tools for SARS-CoV-2 research.",Grillari J,Austrian Cluster for Tissue Regeneration,

BaEV lentiviruses have been shown to efficiently infect hematopoietic stem cells, primary B cells, and NK cells, which traditional VSV-G lentiviruses cannot infect. However, there is a problem of low virus yield in the production of BaEV lentivirus. The formation of syncytium and apoptosis occur after plasmid transfection, and resulting in a reduction in virus production. In this study, the issue of low production of BaEV lentivirus was comprehensively improved. By increasing the cell density of inoculation, reducing the amount of BaEV plasmid, and adjusting the harvest time, the maximum titer of BaEV lentivirus reached 4.43E+ 06 IU/ml, representing an increase of 369 times compared to the unoptimized condition.

Some of the major obstacles to cellular immunotherapy in solid tumors include inefficient cell infiltration into tumors, lack of prolonged cellular persistence, and therapy-associated toxicity. To boost the cytotoxic potential of TAC-T cells against solid tumors, we generated a novel NECTIN-4-targeted TAC-T variant, NECTIN-4 TAC28-T, which integrated the co-stimulatory CD28 cytoplasmic region, and compared the anti-tumor activities between NECTIN-4 TAC-T cells and NECTIN-4 TAC28-T cells in vitro and vivo. We demonstrated NECTIN-4 TAC28-Tcells could be effectively activated by NECTIN-4 protein-coated magnetic beads (NECTIN-4-beads), and further revealed that the incorporated CD28 co-stimulatory domain enhanced their activation and proliferation capabilities. Notably, NECTIN-4 TAC28-T cells exhibited better anti-tumor effects both in vitro and in vivo than the original NECTIN-4 TAC-T cells. Our data highlighted that NECTIN-4 TAC28-T cells may represent a promising, safe and effective cell therapy for NECTIN-4-overexpressing solid tumors.",,,

Bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) and their exosomes have demonstrated potential in modulating T cells, dendtitic cells (DCs), and cytokines to achieve immunomodulatory effects. DCs, as key antigen-presenting cells, play a critical role in shaping immune responses by influencing T-cell activation and cytokine production. Through this modulation, BMSCs and their exosomes enhance graft tolerance and prolonging survival. To explore the immunomodulatory effects of exosomes derived from BMSCs overexpressing microRNA-540-3p (miR-540-3p) on cardiac allograft tolerance, focusing on how these exosomes modulating DCs and T cells activity through the CD74/nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-κB) pathway. Rat models were used to assess the impact of miR-540-3p-enhanced exosomes on immune tolerance in cardiac allografts. MiR-540-3p expression was manipulated in BMSCs, and derived exosomes were collected and administered to the rat models post-heart transplantation. The study monitored expression levels of major histocompatibility complex II, CD80, CD86, and CD274 in DCs, and quantified CD4 Exosomes from miR-540-3p-overexpressing BMSCs lead to reduced expression of immune activation markers CD74 and NF-κB p65 in DCs and T cells. Rats treated with these exosomes showed decreased inflammation and improved cardiac function, indicated by lower levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (interleukin-1β, interferon-γ) and higher levels of anti-inflammatory cytokines (interleukin-10, transforming growth factor β1). Additionally, miR-540-3p skewed the profiles of DCs and T cells towards immune tolerance, increasing the ratio of T regulatory cells and shifting cytokine secretion to favor graft acceptance. Exosomes derived from BMSCs overexpressing miR-540-3p significantly enhance immune tolerance and prolong cardiac allograft survival by modulating the CD74/NF-κB pathway, which regulates activities of DCs and T cells. These findings highlight a promising therapeutic strategy to improve heart transplantation outcomes and potentially reduce the need for prolonged immunosuppression.",,,maofugang666@163.com.

(EBHM), commonly known as Dengzhan Asarum, was first recorded in the South Yunnan Materia Medica. E. breviscapus is widely utilized for treating stroke hemiplegia due to its ability to enhance blood circulation, clear collaterals, and alleviate pain (Liu et al., 2024). This species is recognized as a natural medicinal resource in China and is increasingly recognized as the primary source of such materials in Yunnan Province (Dong et al., 2022). In July 2023, virus-like symptoms, including leaf chlorosis and necrosis, were observed in 20 E. breviscapus plants in Luxi Province, Yunnan, China, with an incidence rate of approximately 10% among the examined specimens (Figure 1a-1c). Electron microscopy revealed the presence of spherical virions, measuring between 80 and 120 nm, which exhibited morphological characteristics consistent with members of the Orthotospovirus genus. These virions were localized within the cytoplasm of the mesophyll cells (Figure 1d). Total RNA was extracted from the infected E. breviscapus plants using the TRNzol Universal Reagent (Tiangen Biotech, Beijing, China), and cDNA synthesis was performed using the PrimeScript™ IV 1st strand cDNA Synthesis Mix (TaKaRa, Beijing, China). A 280 bp PCR product amplified using the dTospo-F2/dTospo-R2 primer pair (Zheng et al., 2020) was cloned and sequenced. A total of 10 samples were subjected to RT-PCR and sequencing. A 20 μL reaction system was prepared in PCR tubes, consisting of cDNA (100 ng/μL), forward primer (10 μM), reverse primer (10 μM), PrimeSTAR Max DNA Polymerase (1x) (TaKaRa, Beijing, China), and ddH2O. The PCR reaction procedure included the following steps: 98 ◦C for 10 s; followed by 35 cycles of 98 ◦C for 20 s, 56 ◦C for 1 min, and 72 ◦C for 1 min; concluding with an extension at 72 ◦C for 10 min. A BLASTn search of the sequenced amplicons against the NCBI GenBank viral database revealed a 97.83% nucleotide identity with the corresponding sequences of the TSWV-BJFC-Ze strain (MN493846.1), which was isolated from Zinnia elegans in China. This finding confirmed the presence of the tomato spotted wilt orthotospovirus in the E. breviscapus samples. The primers were specifically designed to target the partial genome of each segment reported for TSWV-BJFC-Ze (MN493846, MN493847, MN493848) to amplify the S, M, and L segments obtained via RT-PCR. The expected PCR product sizes were S (3 kb), M (4.8 kb), and L (8.9 kb). The segments were amplified using KOD One™ PCR Master Mix (Toyobo), followed by cloning, sequencing, and assembly. The assembled S, M, and L segments of TSWV-EBHM-1 were found to be 2,956 nt (PP596540), 4,773 nt (PP596541), and 8,913 nt (PP596542), respectively. A BLASTn analysis confirmed that the S, M, and L segments exhibited 99.23%, 99.43%, and 99.56% identity, respectively, to the TSWV-HLJ-1 (MG878875, MG878874, MG878873) sequences. We achieved 98% coverage of the virus genome through cloning and sequencing, which was sufficient to confidently establish its identity. Our team also conducted a disease incidence survey in three fields of E. breviscapus in Luxi province. Prior to the identification of TSWV, a symptom survey was performed, and samples were collected from symptomatic plants. We recorded a symptom incidence of 30% across all three fields. To our knowledge, this is the first report of an E. breviscapus infection by TSWV.

Patients who have colorectal cancer that has spread to other parts of the body (metastasized) only live for 2 to 3 years after their diagnosis. Tucatinib is a medicine that has shown promising anti-tumor activity when it is given in combination with trastuzumab in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer that is of a certain type, called HER2-positive. HER2 is a protein that, when present in amounts above normal in cancer cells, can cause them to grow more and survive longer. The MOUNTAINEER-03 study is a trial in progress of patients with HER2-positive metastatic colorectal cancer. In this trial, researchers are investigating if tucatinib in combination with trastuzumab and chemotherapy increases the length of time patients live before their cancer grows or spreads (also called progression-free survival) and how long a person is alive after the start of treatment (also called overall survival) compared to standard of care treatment (chemotherapy combination). Researchers are also investigating whether this new tucatinib combination treatment makes the colorectal cancer shrink and stop spreading and if it is safe to use in patients with HER2-positive metastatic colorectal cancer.

However, it is unknown whether PVS can predict dementia risk and brain atrophy trajectories in participants without dementia, as longitudinal studies on PVS are scarce and current methods for PVS assessment lack robustness and inter-scanner reproducibility. We developed a robust algorithm to automatically assess PVS count and size on clinical MRI, and investigated 1) their relationship with dementia risk and brain atrophy in participants without dementia, 2) their longitudinal evolution, and 3) their potential use as a screening tool in simulated clinical trials. We analysed 46,478 clinical measurements of cognitive functioning and 20,845 brain MRI scans from 10,004 participants (71.1 ± 9.7 years-old, 56.6% women) from three publicly available observational studies on ageing and dementia (the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative, the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Centre database, and the Open Access Series of Imaging Studies). Clinical and MRI data collected between 2004 and 2022 were analysed with consistent methods, controlling for confounding factors, and combined using mixed-effects models. Our fully-automated method for PVS assessment showed excellent inter-scanner reproducibility (intraclass correlation coefficients >0.8). Fewer PVS and larger PVS diameter at baseline predicted higher dementia risk and accelerated brain atrophy. Longitudinal trajectories of PVS markers differed significantly in participants without dementia who converted to dementia compared with non-converters. In simulated placebo-controlled trials for treatments targeting cognitive decline, screening out participants at low risk of dementia based on our PVS markers enhanced the power of the trial independently of Alzheimer's disease biomarkers. These robust cerebrovascular markers predict dementia risk and brain atrophy and may improve risk-stratification of patients, potentially reducing cost and increasing throughput of clinical trials to combat dementia.

Combination responses were usually no better than the best single agent, with enhanced response in only ~13% of PDX, and apparent antagonism in a comparable percentage. Single-omic comparisons showed largely non-overlapping results between genes associated with single agent and combination treatments that could be validated in independent patient cohorts. Multi-omic analyses of PDXs identified agent-specific biomarkers/biomarker combinations, nominating high Cytokeratin-5 (KRT5) as a general marker of responsiveness.

In Rounds 2 and 3, they voted on 500 initial statements (yes/no) relating to 20 biomarkers of aging. Panel members could abstain from voting on biomarkers outside their expertise. Consensus was reached when there was ≥70% agreement on a statement/biomarker. Of the 460 international panel members invited to participate, 116 completed Round 1, 87 completed Round 2, and 60 completed Round 3. Across the 3 rounds, 14 biomarkers met consensus that spanned physiological (eg, insulin-like growth factor 1, growth-differentiating factor-15), inflammatory (eg, high sensitivity C-reactive protein, interleukin-6), functional (eg, muscle mass, muscle strength, hand grip strength, Timed-Up-and-Go, gait speed, standing balance test, frailty index, cognitive health, blood pressure), and epigenetic (eg, DNA methylation/epigenetic clocks) domains. Expert consensus identified 14 potential biomarkers of aging which may be used as outcome measures in intervention studies. Future aging research should identify which combination of these biomarkers has the greatest utility.",Antarianto RD; Clivaz-Duc M; Colloca G; Hardiany NS; Jain S; Joshi PK; Vorluni L,Department of Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Independent Researcher; Dipartimento di Diagnostica per Immagini; CareConnex; Department of Histology; Humanity Inc; World Public Health Nutrition Association,
39707277,The metabolome of male and female individuals with knee osteoarthritis is influenced by 18-months of weight loss intervention: the IDEA trial.,2024-12-20,BMC musculoskeletal disorders,10.1186/s12891-024-08166-7,"The Intensive Diet and Exercise for Arthritis (IDEA) trial was a randomized trial conducted to evaluate the effects of diet and exercise on osteoarthritis (OA), the most prevalent form of arthritis. Various risk factors, including obesity and sex, contribute to OA's debilitating nature. While diet and exercise are known to improve OA symptoms, cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying these interventions, as well as effects of participant sex, remain elusive. Serum was obtained at three timepoints from IDEA participants assigned to groups of diet, exercise, or combined diet and exercise (n = 10 per group). A randomly selected subset of serum samples were extracted and analyzed via liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry combined with metabolomic profiling to unveil mechanisms associated with types of intervention and disease. Extracted serum was pooled and fragmentation patterns were analyzed to identify metabolites that statistically differentially regulated between groups. Changes in metabolism across male and female IDEA participants after 18-months of diet, exercise, and combined diet and exercise intervention mapped to lipid, amino acid, carbohydrate, vitamin, and matrix metabolism. The diverse metabolic landscape detected across IDEA participants shows that intervention type differentially impacts the serum metabolome of OA individuals. Moreover, dissimilarities in the serum metabolome corresponded with participant sex. These findings suggest that intensive weight loss among males and females offers potential metabolic benefits for individuals with knee OA. This study provides a deeper understanding of dysregulation occurring during OA development in parallel with various interventions, potentially paving the way for improved interventions, treatments, and quality of life of those impacted by OA. clinicaltrials.gov Identifier NCT00381290, Registered, 9/25/2006.",,,rjune@montana.edu.

Data regarding functional roles of human T cells in SARS-CoV-2 (SARS2) viral clearance in primary COVID-19 are limited. To address this knowledge gap, we assessed samples for associations between SARS2 upper respiratory tract viral RNA levels and early virus-specific adaptive immune responses for 95 unvaccinated clinical trial participants with acute primary COVID-19 aged 18-86 years old, approximately half of whom were considered at high risk for progression to severe COVID-19. Functionality and magnitude of acute SARS2-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses were evaluated, in addition to antibody responses. Most individuals with acute COVID-19 developed SARS2-specific T cell responses within 6 days of COVID-19 symptom onset. Early CD4+ T cell and CD8+ T cell responses were polyfunctional, and both strongly associated with reduced upper respiratory tract SARS2 viral RNA, independent of neutralizing antibody titers.

39702590,Role of ZFHX4 in orofacial clefting based on human genetic data and zebrafish models.,2025-05-03,European journal of human genetics : EJHG,10.1038/s41431-024-01775-9,"Orofacial clefting (OFC) is a frequent congenital anomaly and can occur either in the context of underlying syndromes or in isolation (nonsyndromic). The two common OFC phenotypes are cleft lip with/without cleft palate (CL/P) and cleft palate only (CPO). In this study, we searched for penetrant CL/P genes, by evaluating de novo copy number variants (CNV) from an exome sequencing dataset of 50 nonsyndromic patient-parent trios. We detected a heterozygous 86 kb de novo deletion affecting exons 4-11 of ZFHX4, a gene previously associated with OFC. Genetic and phenotypic data from our in-house and the AGORA cohort (710 and 229 individuals with nonsyndromic CL/P) together with literature and database reviews demonstrate that ZFHX4 variants can lead to both nonsyndromic and syndromic forms not only of CL/P but also CPO. Expression analysis in published single-cell RNA-sequencing data (mouse embryo, zebrafish larva) at relevant time-points support an important role of Zfhx4/zfhx4 in craniofacial development. To characterize the role of zfhx4 in zebrafish craniofacial development, we knocked out/down the zebrafish orthologue. Cartilage staining of the zfhx4 CRISPR F0 knockout and morpholino knockdown at 4 days post-fertilization showed an underdeveloped and abnormally shaped ethmoid plate and cartilaginous jaw (resembling micrognathia). While there is evidence for the dominant inheritance of ZFHX4 variants in OFC, we here present a patient with a possible recessive inheritance. In conclusion, ZFHX4 has a highly heterogeneous phenotypic spectrum and variable mode of inheritance. Our data highlight that ZFHX4 should be considered in genetic testing in patients with nonsyndromic clefting.",Carels C,Department of Human Genetics,nina.ishorst@uni-bonn.de.

Lowering LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C) levels post-revascularization significantly reduces these risks. This analysis compared LDL-C-lowering therapies at baseline and over time among patients with and without prior coronary revascularization in the GOULD registry (a prospective multicenter cohort study). Baseline- and 24-month follow-up characteristics-including LDL-C levels and strategies for lipid-lowering therapy (LLT)-were evaluated. Out of 5006 patients, 2195 (43.8%) had prior coronary revascularization. At baseline, these patients had lower LDL-C (99.2 mg/dL vs. 102.5 mg/dL; p < 0.001) and were more likely to be on intensive LLT (52.8% vs. 42.7%; p < 0.001). At 24 months, they had small reductions in LDL-C (-15.6% vs. -13.7%; p = 0.145) and were more likely to be on intensive LLT (61.9% vs. 51.5%; p < 0.001). Similar LDL-C reductions were observed in the PCSK9i group regardless of revascularization status. Despite slightly better baseline LLT among patients with prior revascularization, few patients met the <70 mg/dL goal and LLT was rarely escalated during 24 months of follow-up. Improved systems-based strategies and personalized treatment approaches are urgently needed to enhance LDL-C lowering and reduce cardiovascular events, especially in patients with a history of coronary revascularization.",,,Benjamin.Peterson@stelizabeth.com.

The following 12 points have been approved by the Research Committee of the Society: 1. HMB is a metabolite of the amino acid leucine that is naturally produced in both humans and other animals. Two forms of HMB have been studied: Calcium HMB (HMB-Ca) and a free acid form of HMB (HMB-FA). HMB-FA appears to lead to increased appearance of HMB in the bloodstream when compared to HMB-Ca, though recent results are mixed. 2. The available safety/toxicity data suggest that chronic HMB-Ca and HMB-FA consumption are safe for oral HMB supplementation in humans up to at least one year. 3. There are no negative effects of HMB-Ca and HMB-FA on glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity in humans. There may be improvements in glucose metabolism in younger adults. 4. The primary mode of action of HMB appears to be through its dual mechanism to enhance muscle protein synthesis and suppress muscle protein breakdown. HMB's activation of mTORC1 is independent of the leucine-sensing pathway (Sestrin2-GATOR2 complex). 5. HMB may help reduce muscle damage and promote muscle recovery, which can promote muscle growth/repair. HMB may also have anti-inflammatory effects, which could contribute to reducing muscle damage and soreness. 6. HMB consumption in close proximity to an exercise bout may be beneficial to increase muscle protein synthesis and attenuate the inflammatory response. HMB can provide a beneficial physiological effect when consumed both acutely and chronically in humans. 7. Daily HMB supplementation (38 mg/kg body weight) in combination with exercise training may improve body composition through increasing lean mass and/or decreasing fat mass with benefits in participants across age, sex, and training status. The most pronounced of these improvements in body composition with HMB have been observed in studies with robust resistance training programs and dietary control. 8. HMB may improve strength and power in untrained individuals, but its performance benefits in trained athletes are mixed and increase with an increase in study duration (>6 weeks). HMB's beneficial effects on athletic performance are thought to be driven by improved recovery. 9. HMB supplementation appears to potentially have a positive impact on aerobic performance, especially in trained athletes. The mechanisms of the effects are unknown. 10. HMB supplementation may be important in a non-exercising sedentary and aging population to improve muscle strength, functionality, and muscle quality. The effects of HMB supplementation with exercise are varied, but the combination may have a beneficial effect on the treatment of age-associated sarcopenia under select conditions. 11. HMB may be effective in countering muscle disuse atrophy during periods of inactivity due to illness or injury. The modulation of mitochondrial dynamics and lipid metabolism by HMB may be a potential mechanism for preventing disuse atrophy and aiding rehabilitation beyond HMB's effects on rates of muscle protein synthesis and degradation. 12. The efficacy of HMB in combination with certain nutrients may be enhanced under select conditions.",Rathmacher JA; Pitchford LM; Townsend JR; Jäger R,Increnovo LLC; Research; MTI Biotech Inc,

The present study aims to inform the most recent data on the strength of clinical evidence supporting such approvals. Evidentiary characteristics of pre-approval pivotal clinical studies and regulator-required post-approval confirmatory studies supporting AAs between 2015 and 2022 were extracted from publicly available FDA documents. Descriptive analyses were conducted for each of the characteristic including study design, study phase, primary endpoint, number of participants, and magnitude of effect. Trends of these characteristics over time were documented and accounted for class of drugs, application type, novelty, orphan status, and oncology/non-oncology indications. During 2015-2022, 156 drug-indication pairs received AA. To support these AAs, 77% of pre-approval pivotal trials employed single-arm designs, and 22% were phase I trials, with a median of 92 participants (IQR, 45-125); 61% of post-approval confirmatory studies were required by FDA to use randomized controlled design, 25% to use clinical endpoints, and 33% specified the number of participants requirement. During the 8-year observation period, the pairs approved via AA pathway almost tripled from 20 (2015-2016) to 59 (2019-2020) and fell to 36 (2021-2022); the corresponding proportion to all new drug approvals showed the same trend. Single-arm pre-approval pivotal studies increased from 55% (2015-2016) to 91% (2019-2020) and fell to 69% (2021-2022), while the median number of participants decreased from 106 (2015-2016) to 59 (2019-2020) and rose to 106 (2021-2022). Randomized controlled post-approval confirmatory studies decreased from 75% (2015-2016) to 42% (2019-2020) and rebounded to 75% (2021-2022), while those using surrogate endpoints increased from 50% (2015-2016) to 72% (2021-2022). Analyses adjusting for drug class, application type, novelty, orphan status, and oncology/non-oncology showed similar results. The number of drug-indication pairs receiving AA increased sharply during 2015-2016 to 2019-2020 but fell in 2021-2022. Meanwhile, the strength of clinical evidence supporting FDA's AAs appeared to decline from 2015 to 2020 but seems to have improved in 2021-2022.

From January 2021 to December 2023, 20 centers located at five different European countries (Greece, Slovenia, Romania, Albania, and Italy) joined EPROPA, with 555 patients with advanced NSCLC registered to the program. Anonymized patients' clinical-pathological data were shared through the EPROPA web platform and tissue samples were collected at the Molecular Pathology Unit of the Reference Center (University of Turin) for molecular analyses. A comprehensive genomic profiling by a targeted next-generation sequencing approach has been performed and molecular reports have been discussed within the molecular tumor board to assess patients' eligibility for clinical trials. The average turnaround time was eight days, with only 30 out of 555 tissue samples (6%) not suitable for molecular analysis.

This study aimed to explore the morphological differences between invasive and non-invasive areas in early esophageal cancer specimens that have undergone endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD), using artificial intelligence (AI) to shed light on the underlying mechanisms. In this study, data from 75 patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) were analyzed and endoscopic assessments were conducted to determine submucosal (SM) invasion. An AI model, specifically a Clustering-constrained Attention Multiple Instance Learning model (CLAM), was developed to predict the depth of cancer by training on surface histological images taken from both invasive and non-invasive regions. The AI model highlighted specific image portions, or patches, which were further examined to identify morphological differences between the two types of areas. The 256-pixel AI model demonstrated an average area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) value of 0.869 and an accuracy (ACC) of 0.788. The analysis of the AI-identified patches revealed that regions with invasion (SM) exhibited greater vascularity compared with non-invasive regions (epithelial). The invasive patches were characterized by a significant increase in the number and size of blood vessels, as well as a higher count of red blood cells (all with p-values <0.001). In conclusion, this study demonstrated that AI could identify critical differences in surface histopathology between non-invasive and invasive regions, particularly highlighting a higher number and larger size of blood vessels in invasive areas.",,,

CD is a chronic inflammatory condition affecting the gastrointestinal tract that often causes extraintestinal complications. The underlying etiology of CD involves genetic, environmental, and local factors. Orofacial manifestations of CD include gingivitis, mucosal tags, aphthous ulcerations, labial swellings, cobblestoning, and linear ulcers of the oral vestibules. A previously healthy 12-year-old boy presented with painful, constant, diffuse oral ulcerations. His diagnostic and laboratory testing supported a diagnosis of CD. The patient was then treated with budesonide (Entocort, Perrigo Company), prednisone (Deltasone, Pfizer Inc), and infliximab infusions (Remicade, Janssen Biotech). Later, he had high levels of anti-infliximab antibodies and inadequate control of his orofacial lesions. He then began taking a different class of biologic medication, ustekinumab. After initiation of ustekinumab, both his oral and intestinal manifestations markedly improved. Collaboration between the treating dentist and treating gastroenterologist is recommended for management of the orofacial manifestations of CD. This may lead to an improvement in the patient's prognosis and quality of life. Ustekinumab is an anti-p40 antibody that inhibits interleukins 12 and 23. It is a newer biologic medication, and its use has been increasing in the pediatric population with CD.

PIK-75 has shown potential as a therapy in preclinical cancer models, but it has not been used in the clinic, at least in part, due to limited solubility. We therefore developed a nanoparticle to encapsulate PIK-75 and enable targeted cellular delivery. Scavenger receptor class B type 1 (SR-B1) is often overexpressed in cancer compared with normal cells, which enables targeting by synthetic lipid nanoparticles with some features of native high-density lipoprotein (HDL), the natural ligand of SR-B1. We investigated the use of organic core (oc) molecular platforms to synthesize HDL-like nanoparticles (oc-HDL NP). Employing an oc, we successfully formulated PIK-75 into oc-HDL NPs. The PIK-75 loaded oc-HDL NP (PIK-75 oc-HDL NP), comprising ∼20 PIK-75 molecules/NP, has similar size, surface charge, and surface composition as oc-HDL NP and natural human HDL. Using prostate cancer (PCa) and cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) models known to be sensitive to inhibitors of p110α and p38γ, respectively, we found that PIK-75 oc-HDL NPs specifically targeted SR-B1 to deliver PIK-75 and potently induced cell death ",Kwon D; Wu X; Querfeld C; Yin HH,High Throughput Screening Core; Department of Computational and Quantitative Medicine; Department of Pathology,

However, the effect of these two compounds on hyperlipidemia and the related molecular mechanisms were still unclear. This work was performed to examine the hypolipidemic capacity of capsaicin and quercitrin as well as the related signaling pathways. Hyperlipidemia was induced in mice by feeding them with a high-fat diet for 4 weeks. Both capsaicin and quercitrin were beneficial to inhibit a rise in fasting glucose, total cholesterol, total triglycerides, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and total bile acids and to lift the level of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in the serum. The optimal lipid-lowering data were achieved in the capsaicin and quercitrin/3:1 group. Supplementation with capsaicin and quercitrin both singly and together in the feed caused a significant influence on the metabolite profiles of mouse serum. The signaling pathway for the hypolipidemic effect of capsaicin and quercitrin was related to the down-regulation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) but the up-regulation of phosphatidylin-ositol-3-kinase (PI3K), protein kinase Bb(Akt), farnesoid X receptor 1 (FXR1), and cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase (CYP7A1).

Excessive activation of the protooncogene c-Myc (c-Myc) is associated with the proliferation and stemness of EC cells. Phosphocholine (PC), which is synthesized by choline kinase alpha (CHKA) catalysis, is upregulated in EC tumor tissues. The present study aimed to investigate the effect of PC accumulation on EC cells and clarify the relationship between PC accumulation and c-Myc activity in EC. The c-Myc and CHKA expression in EC tumor tissues were examined using immunohistochemistry. Cell Counting Kit-8 assay, colony formation assay, flow cytometry, western blotting, BrdU staining, and tumorsphere formation assay were used to assess the effect of PC accumulation on EC cells. The mechanism by which PC accumulation inhibits c-Myc was evaluated using RNA-sequencing. Patient-derived organoid (PDO) models were utilised to explore the preclinical efficacy of PC against EC cells. PC accumulation suppressed EC cell proliferation and stemness by inhibiting the activation of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)-c-Myc signaling. PC accumulation promoted excessive reactive oxygen species production, which reduced the expression of GTPase HRAS. This, in turn, inhibited the mTOR-c-Myc axis and induced EC cell apoptosis. Finally, PC impeded proliferation and downregulated the expression of the mTOR-MYC signaling in EC PDO models. PC accumulation impairs the proliferation ability and stem cell characteristics of EC cells by inhibiting the activated mTOR-c-Myc axis, potentially offering a promising strategy to enhance the efficacy of EC clinical therapy through the promotion of PC accumulation in tumor cells.",,,shikun28@hotmail.com.

The pathogenesis of these conditions is multifactorial, encompassing intricate interplays among genetic predispositions, environmental determinants, and hormonal fluctuations. The spectrum of autoimmune diseases is broad, impacting a multitude of organ systems, with notable examples such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), multiple sclerosis (MS), psoriasis, and vitiligo. Despite substantial progress in therapeutic interventions over recent years, a definitive cure for autoimmune diseases has yet to be realized, with existing modalities largely providing palliative care. Cellular therapy is considered the fourth pillar in the management of oncological disorders subsequent to surgical resection, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy. Cellular therapies have shown potential in augmenting immune competence and eliminating of targeted neoplastic cells in a spectrum of cancers. As targeting specific molecules on the surface of autoreactive B and T cells, such as CD19, BCMA, CD20, and CTLA-4, cellular therapies are emerging as promising approaches for the treatment of autoimmune diseases.

However, continual evolution during prostate cancer progression can result in AR alterations (e.g., mutation, amplification, and splicing) that can cause tumors to become resistant to these therapies. Bavdegalutamide (ARV-110) is a PROteolysis TArgeting Chimera (PROTAC) protein degrader that recruits the cereblon-containing E3 ubiquitin ligase to direct the polyubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation of AR. Bavdegalutamide selectively degrades wild-type AR and most clinically relevant mutants with low nanomolar potency. The advantages of the degradation mechanism of action are demonstrated by the higher activity of bavdegalutamide relative to the AR antagonist enzalutamide in cell-based systems that assess effects on PSA synthesis, proliferation of prostate cancer cells, and induction of apoptosis. In an AR-expressing patient-derived xenograft mouse model, bavdegalutamide showed substantial AR degradation and greater tumor growth inhibition compared with enzalutamide. Bavdegalutamide also showed robust tumor growth inhibition in enzalutamide- and abiraterone-resistant prostate cancer animal models and enhanced activity in combination with abiraterone. These promising preclinical data supported the clinical development of bavdegalutamide as a potential treatment for patients with prostate cancer.

Here, we demonstrate the distinct effects of PROTEIN TARGETING TO STARCH2b (PTST2b) and MYOSIN RESEMBLING CHLOROPLAST PROTEIN (MRC) on tuber starch granule morphology. A gene duplication event in the Solanaceae resulted in two PTST2 paralogs (PTST2a and PTST2b). PTST2b is expressed in potato tubers, and unlike PTST2a, it had no detectable interaction with STARCH SYNTHASE 4. MRC expression was detectable in leaves, but not in tubers. Using transgenic potato lines in the variety Clearwater Russet, we demonstrate that MRC overexpression leads to the formation of granules with aberrant shapes, many of which arise from multiple initiation points. Silencing PTST2b led to the production of striking near-spherical granules, each arising from a single, central initiation point. Contrary to all reported PTST2 mutants in other species, we observed no change in the number of granules per cell in these lines, suggesting PTST2b is specifically involved in the control of starch granule shape. Starch content and tuber yield per plant were not affected by PTST2b silencing, but MRC overexpression led to strong decreases in both parameters. Notably, the spherical granules in PTST2b silencing lines had a distinctively altered pasting profile, with higher peak and final viscosity than the wild type. Thus, PTST2b and MRC are promising target genes for altering starch granule size and shape in potato tubers, and can be used to create novel starches with altered physicochemical and/or functional properties.",Hochmuth A; Carswell M; Rowland A; Scarbrough D; Esch L; Kamble NU; Habig JW; Seung D,John Innes Centre; Simplot Plant Sciences,

We evaluated lifestyle interventions focusing on physical activity, diet, and sleep in adults with severe mental illness (SMI) and the evidence for their effectiveness. To this end, we conducted a meta-review and searched major electronic databases for articles published prior to 09/2022 and updated our search in 03/2024. We identified 89 relevant systematic reviews and assessed their quality using the SIGN checklist. Based on the findings of our meta-review and on clinical expertise of the authors, we formulated seven recommendations. In brief, evidence supports the application of lifestyle interventions that combine behavioural change techniques, dietary modification, and physical activity to reduce weight and improve cardiovascular health parameters in adults with SMI. Furthermore, physical activity should be used as an adjunct treatment to improve mental health in adults with SMI, including psychotic symptoms and cognition in adults with schizophrenia or depressive symptoms in adults with major depression. To ameliorate sleep quality, cognitive behavioural informed interventions can be considered. Additionally, we provide an overview of key gaps in the current literature. Future studies should integrate both mental and physical health outcomes to reflect the multi-faceted benefits of lifestyle interventions.

While combining immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) and radiotherapy in patients with pancreatic cancer (PC) has yielded promising clinical results, the addition of an anti-IL-6 receptor (IL-6R) antibody has failed to elicit clinical benefits. Notably, a robust TGFβ-specific immune response at baseline in PC patients treated solely with ICIs and radiotherapy correlated with improved survival. Recent preclinical studies demonstrated the efficacy of a TGFβ-based immune modulatory vaccine in controlling PC tumor growth, underscoring the important role of TGFβ-specific immunity in PC. Here, we explored the importance of IL-6 for TGFβ-specific immunity in PC. In a murine model of PC, coadministration of the TGFβ-based immune modulatory vaccine with an anti-IL-6R antibody rendered the vaccine ineffective. IL-6R blockade hampered the development of vaccine-induced T-cells and tumoral T-cell infiltration. Furthermore, it impaired the myeloid population, resulting in increased tumor-associated macrophage infiltration and an enhanced immunosuppressive phenotype. In PC patients, in contrast to those receiving only ICIs and radiotherapy, robust TGFβ-specific T-cell responses at baseline did not correlate with improved survival in patients receiving ICIs, radiotherapy and IL-6R blockade. Peripheral blood immunophenotyping revealed that IL-6R blockade altered the T-cell and monocytic compartments, which was consistent with the findings in the murine model. Our data suggest that the antitumor efficacy of TGFβ-specific T cells in PC depends on the presence of IL-6 within the tumor. Consequently, caution should be exercised when employing IL-6R blockade in patients receiving cancer immunotherapy.",,,Mads.Hald.Andersen@regionh.dk.

Exploratory biomarkers were evaluated to examine potential correlates of efficacy and safety. Eligible participants (≥18 years) were administered 23ME-00610 intravenously every 3 weeks (Q3W) using an accelerated titration design followed by a traditional 3 + 3 design, with an initial dose level of 2 mg. Twenty-eight participants were enrolled across seven cohorts and received a median of four cycles of 23ME-00610. No treatment-related serious adverse events (AE) were observed, and the maximum tolerated dose was not reached. Overall, the PK of 23ME-00610 was linear and dose proportional for doses ≥60 mg, with a median terminal half-life of 13 days at 1,400 mg. Peripheral saturation of CD200R1 was observed for doses ≥60 mg. Immune-related AEs, including rash, pruritus, and hypothyroidism, were predicted by phenome-wide association studies and observed for doses ≥60 mg. A confirmed partial response was observed in a participant with well-differentiated pancreatic neuroendocrine cancer whose tumor was among those with the highest tumor CD200 expression. 23ME-00610 has mild-to-moderate on-target AEs and PK/PD consistent with tumor target saturation and dosing every 3 weeks. The trend for clinical benefit in participants with tumor CD200 expression suggests that 23ME-00610 inhibits CD200R1 signaling and may reverse CD200-mediated immune evasion. Based on PK/PD, safety, and preliminary antitumor activity, 1,400 mg Q3W was selected as the dose for further study. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of the 23andMe genetic database identified CD200R1 as a promising therapeutic target for cancer. This phase 1 study of 23ME-00610, a CD200R1 antagonist IgG1, showed acceptable safety and tolerability, PK supporting Q3W dosing, and PD and preliminary clinical activity supporting an initial recommended phase 2 dose of 1,400 mg.",Razak AA; Glatt DM; Kell S; Diep AN; Schmidt M; Hom C; German C; Shringarpure SS; Majeed SR,Princess Margaret Cancer Centre; 23andMe Therapeutics; 23andMe,

Our study aimed to (a) identify the most commonly pre-specified PRO domains in MM RCTs and those most responsive to modern therapies, and (b) examine the association between PROs and progression-free survival (PFS)/overall survival (OS). We performed a systematic review of MM RCTs that used EORTC QLQ-C30 and published between 01/2014-06/2023. The association between PFS/OS and PRO was explored using Fisher's exact test or Pearson's Chi-squared test. Thirty-five RCTs were identified, with PROs as secondary or exploratory endpoints in all studies.

39643690,The phenomenology of postpartum psychosis: preliminary findings from the Massachusetts General Hospital Postpartum Psychosis Project.,,Molecular psychiatry,10.1038/s41380-024-02856-3,"Postpartum psychosis (PP) is a severe psychiatric disorder-with limited data or consensus on diagnostic criteria and clinical presentation-that affects thousands of people each year. The Massachusetts General Hospital Postpartum Psychosis Project (MGHP3) was established to: 1) describe the phenomenology of PP, and 2) identify genomic and clinical predictors in a large cohort. Results thus far point to a richer understanding of the heterogeneity and complexity of this often-misunderstood illness and its nature over time. Data are collected from those who experienced PP within 6 months of delivery and within the 10 years prior to the MGHP3 interview. Participants provide information via the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview for Psychotic Disorders Studies (MINI-PDS), MGHP3© Questionnaire (including assessment of episode onset, duration, symptoms, and treatment received), and other relevant history. This retrospective study uses validated diagnostic tools to evaluate psychiatric history across participants' lifetimes. Descriptive statistics (e.g., median values, frequencies) were conducted to describe the phenomenology of PP. As of November 3, 2022, 248 participants with histories of at least one episode of PP completed the MGHP3 interview. Most participants met criteria for Bipolar I Disorder with psychotic features (71.8%). During PP episode(s), participants reported odd beliefs or delusions (87.6%), persecutory delusions (75.2%), ideas of reference (55.8%), and visual (52.3%) and/or auditory (48.1%) hallucinations. The median time between delivery and symptom onset was 10 days (SD = 43.72). Most participants reported receiving medication (93.0%) and/or psychotherapy (65.9%). This report describes findings regarding the phenomenology of postpartum psychosis among the MGHP3 cohort, the largest cohort with validated PP studied to date. This ongoing effort to refine the phenotype of PP and to delineate underlying genetic determinants of the disorder will contribute to an enhanced understanding of this serious illness. It also underscores areas for further rigorous assessment using other research methods and sets the stage for translational reproductive neuroscience - including ongoing analyses of neuroimaging and genetic data from the MGHP3 cohort.",,,lcohen2@mgh.harvard.edu.

Our study aims to evaluate postoperative circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) as a predictor of recurrence in patients with pCR or near-pCR after curative-intent neoadjuvant chemotherapy or neoadjuvant chemoradiation and surgery. We retrospectively identified patients from 11 institutions with stages I-IV esophagogastric cancers (EGCs) who completed NAT and had TRG-0/1 scores at the time of curative-intent surgery. Postoperative plasma samples were collected for ctDNA analysis within a 16-week molecular residual disease (MRD) window after definitive surgery, and during surveillance from January 7, 2020, to November 9, 2023, at the provider's discretion. ctDNA was assessed using a clinically validated, personalized, tumor-informed ctDNA assay (Signatera, Natera, Inc).

CRS is divided into two distinct phenotypes, CRS with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) and without (CRSsNP). The aim of the review is to provide an update on the current knowledge in CRS endotypes. The prevailing hypothesis regarding the pathogenesis of CRS suggests that dysfunctional interactions between the host and environmental stressors at the mucosal surface drive the diverse inflammatory mechanisms. Genetic and epigenetic variations in the mucosal immune system are believed to play a significant role in the pathomechanisms of CRS. Various environmental agents (such as microbes and irritants) have been implicated in CRS. In a healthy state, the sinonasal mucosa acts as a barrier, modulating environmental stimulation and mounting appropriate immune responses against pathogens with minimal tissue damage. Different endotypes may exist based on the specific mechanistic pathways driving the chronic tissue inflammation of CRS. There is a need to understand endotypes in order to better predict, diagnose, and treat CRS. This literature review provides an update on the role of the endotypes in CRS and the limitations of endotyping CRS in clinical practice. Understanding of the pathogenesis and optimal management of CRS has progressed significantly in the last decades; however, there still are several unmet needs in endotype research.",Hox V; Rudenko M,London Allergy and Immunology Centre; Department of Otorhinolaryngology,

Nucleic acids,10.1016/j.omtn.2024.102308,"Although chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy has revolutionized type B cancer treatment, efficacy remains limited in various lymphomas and solid tumors. Reinforcing conventional CAR-T cells to release cytokines can improve their efficacy but also increase safety concerns. Several strategies have been developed to regulate their secretion using minimal promoters that are controlled by chimeric proteins harboring transactivators. However, these chimeric proteins can disrupt the normal physiology of T cells. Here, we present the first transactivator-free anti-CD19 CAR-T cells able to control IL-18 expression (iTRUCK19.18) under ultra-low doses of doxycycline and without altering cellular fitness. Interestingly, IL-18 secretion requires T cell activation in addition to doxycycline, allowing the external regulation of CAR-T cell potency. This effect was translated into an increased CAR-T cell antitumor activity against aggressive hematologic and solid tumor models. In a clinically relevant context, we generated patient-derived iTRUCK19.18 cells capable of eradicating primary B cells tumors in a doxycycline-dependent manner. Furthermore, IL-18-releasing CAR-T cells polarized pro-tumoral macrophages toward an antitumoral phenotype, suggesting potential for modulating the tumor microenvironment. In summary, we showed that our platform can generate exogenously controlled CAR-T cells with enhanced potency and in the absence of transactivators.",Rodriguez-Madoz JR; Prosper F,Centro de Investigacion Biomedica en Red de Cancer (CIBERONC),

Studies have reported an increased incidence of RML in individuals with severe COVID-19 infection. However, the exact mechanisms remain unclear and are believed to involve the host's immune response to the virus. Furthermore, RML has been documented as a rare adverse event following COVID-19 vaccination, particularly with mRNA vaccines. Proposed mechanisms include immune responses triggered by the vaccine and T-cell activation against viral spike proteins. This study aims to review the current literature on the incidence, pathophysiology, clinical presentation, and outcomes of RML secondary to COVID-19 infection and vaccination. We identify common risk factors and mechanisms underlying this condition by analyzing case reports, clinical studies, and pharmacovigilance data. Our findings suggest that while RML is a relatively rare adverse event, it warrants attention due to its potential severity and the widespread prevalence of COVID-19 and its vaccines.

Autophagy is involved in the progression of CCa. ULK1 is a crucial kinase in autophagy initiation. However, few studies have investigated the role of ULK1 phosphorylation at tyrosine residues in the progression of CCa, and the underlying mechanism remains elusive. In this study, we demonstrated that JAK2 is a novel upstream kinase that phosphorylates ULK1 at the tyrosine site. JAK2 interacts with and phosphorylates ULK1 at Tyr1007. The phosphorylation of ULK1 at Y1007 increases its activity and stability, activates autophagy, and promotes the progression of CCa. We further showed that the phosphorylation of ULK1 at Y1007 is a predictive marker of CCa patient outcome. Furthermore, we identified SRPK1 as a potential downstream substrate of ULK1 to promote the progression of CCa. Our research sheds light on the molecular mechanism of CCa progression, through JAK2/ULK1 axis, and emphasizes the phosphorylation of ULK1 at Y1007 as a predictor of CCa.",,,duanqhwz@henu.edu.cn.

Therefore, we performed comprehensive univariate analyses to identify factors associated with severe (grade 3-4) early ICAHT (eICAHT) in 691 patients who received commercial or investigational CAR T-cell therapy for hematologic malignancies. In univariate logistic regression, preinfusion factors associated with severe eICAHT included disease type (acute lymphoblastic leukemia), prelymphodepletion (pre-LD) blood counts including absolute neutrophil count (ANC), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and inflammatory (C-reactive protein [CRP], ferritin, and interleukin-6 [IL-6]) and coagulopathy biomarkers (D-dimer). Postinfusion laboratory markers associated with severe eICAHT included early and peak levels of inflammatory biomarkers (CRP, ferritin, and IL-6), coagulopathy biomarkers (D-dimer), peak cytokine release syndrome grade, and peak neurotoxicity grade.

Nonetheless, there is a real need to optimize CAR-T cell therapy and overcome its existing limitations. The importance of cellular starting material for generating CAR-T cells is undeniable, as the current personalized manufacturing approach is the main roadblock to providing a fast, affordable, and standard treatment for patients. Thus, developing an off-the-shelf CAR-T product is a leading focus in adoptive cell therapy. Several biotech companies worldwide are focused on developing an off-the-shelf CAR-T product from allogeneic sources. Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) have unique characteristics, making them highly attractive among various allogeneic sources. IPSCs can be modified with CAR, undergo other intended gene manipulations, and then be differentiated into functional hematopoietic lineages with anti-cancer activity. Moreover, iPSCs provide an unlimited cell source, simplifying the setting of a standard treatment protocol by generating a homogenous population of resulting cells and reducing batch-to-batch inconsistency. In this review, we delve into the manufacturing of iPSC-derived CAR-T (iCAR-T) cells and discuss the path and challenges of their clinical translation. We also introduce some iPSC-derived cellular alternatives to conventional iCAR-αβ-T cells, including iCAR-T cells with a limited TCR diversity, iCAR-NK, iCAR-macrophages, and iCAR-neutrophils and discuss their relative advantages and disadvantages as well as their differentiation from iPSCs in compliance with cGMP. Finally, we reviewed iPSC-derived CAR-engineered cells being evaluated in clinical trials.",,,

Fusion of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), such as RET, ALK, and FGFR3, has been reported to mediate EGFR TKI resistance. Given the rarity of these fusions and the heterogeneous nature of the condition, no prospective clinical trials evaluated the incidence, safety, and therapeutic benefit of dual EGFR-RTK inhibition. We queried clinical databases from multiple institutions to identify patients who had RTK fusions detected on next-generation sequencing testing results from tissue or blood at five institutions: the Second Affiliated Hospital Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hunan Cancer Hospital, Prince of Wales Hospital Chinese University of Hong Kong, Chao Family Cancer Center, and the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center from March 1, 2016, to September 30, 2023. The data analyzed included objective response rate (ORR) to treatment post RTK fusion detection, duration of treatment, and safety. A comprehensive literature search was conducted to identify patients with RTK fusion as the primary resistance mechanism in EGFR-mutated NSCLC patients. Twenty-seven patients were identified to be eligible in the analysis. ALK fusions were most reported (42.9%), followed by RET fusions (35.7%). Fifteen patients received dual TKI after fusion detection and nine received fusion targeting single TKIs. The median time on treatment was 169 days or 5.8 months (35-1050 d). ORR by the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors in the evaluable 25 patients was 24% and the disease control rate was 80%. In 14 evaluable patients who received dual TKI therapy, ORR by the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors was 21.4%, and the disease control rate was 78.6%. No new toxicities were observed with dual EGFR-RTK inhibition. In the literature review, after pooling 291 patients from 59 studies, RET fusions were the most common (50.0%), followed by BRAF (13.3%), ALK (13.3%), FGFR (10%), NTRK (5.3%), EGFR (1.7%), ROS1 (1.3%), MET (1%), and ERBB (0.7%). The emergence of RTK fusions is one of the mechanisms of bypass resistance of EGFR TKI.

The aim of this analysis was to report the interim 1-year data for patients with AD enrolled in the GLOBOSTAD registry, including treatment patterns, dupilumab effectiveness and safety, and healthcare burden. GLOBOSTAD is an ongoing, 5-year, multinational, prospective, observational study of adult/adolescent (aged ≥ 12 years at baseline) patients with AD who initiated dupilumab in real-world settings according to their local country-specific prescribing guidelines. Outcomes were evaluated at baseline and at 3, 6 and 12 months and included Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) total score, SCORing Atopic Dermatitis (SCORAD) total score, percent body surface area (BSA) affected, Patient-Oriented Eczema Measure (POEM), Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) total score for adults or Children's Dermatology Life Quality Index (CDLQI) total score for adolescents and pruritus Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) total score. At the interim 1-year cut-off (March 2023), 955 patients were enrolled in GLOBOSTAD, and follow-up data were obtained from 903 patients. After dupilumab initiation, mean improvements in effectiveness outcome measures from baseline to month 3 were EASI from 25.1 to 6.1, SCORAD 59.3 to 25.3, POEM 19.7 to 8.7, DLQI 13.7 to 5.3, CDLQI 12.2 to 2.7 and pruritus NRS 6.3 to 2.5, with each measure exceeding the minimal clinically important difference. These positive changes in effectiveness outcomes were maintained or further improved through 12 months since treatment initiation. AD-related hospitalizations and emergency room or urgent care facility visits decreased from 11.1% to 1.7% from baseline to month 12. In a multinational real-world setting, dupilumab demonstrated rapid, robust and sustained effectiveness in patients with moderate-to-severe AD across multiple disease domains, including AD signs, symptoms, quality of life and emergency/urgent care visits. Safety was consistent with the known dupilumab safety profile. ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier NCT03992417. Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic relapsing skin disease that can have a negative effect on the quality of patients’ lives. In clinical trials, when patients with AD were treated with a drug called dupilumab, there were improvements in their AD signs and symptoms and quality of life. More information is needed about how well dupilumab works when patients are prescribed the drug by their doctors in the real world over a long period. In total, almost 1000 adults and adolescents with AD joined a prospective observational study called GLOBOSTAD. GLOBOSTAD aims to follow them for up to 5 years after their first dupilumab treatment. This study looked at the effects of dupilumab in about 900 patients during their first year of treatment. At 3 months after starting dupilumab, there were improvements in each of the measures that show how effective a treatment is. These included measures that doctors use to judge how serious AD is. They also included measures that patients use to report how serious they feel their AD is and how AD affects their quality of life. After 1 year, those changes had either stayed or improved further. After 1 year, there was also an improvement in how often patients had to visit the hospital because of their AD. Safety was consistent with the known dupilumab safety information.",Ferrucci SM; Wu J; Ardeleanu M; Bosman K,Unit of Dermatology; Sanofi; Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc.,piergiacomo.calzavarapinton@unibs.it.

We aimed to determine whether vorbipiprant, a prostaglandin E2 receptor EP4 subtype antagonist, can convert immune-resistant mCRC into a tumor responsive to anti-PD-1 inhibition. This phase Ib/IIa prospective, open-label, single-arm trial followed a 3 + 3 dose-escalation and dose-optimization design. A total of 28 patients with chemorefractory pMMR/MSS mCRC were given dose-escalated oral vorbipiprant (30, 90, or 180 mg twice daily), along with biweekly intravenous balstilimab (3 mg/kg), an anti-PD-1 antibody. The primary endpoints included safety and the disease control rate (DCR). Secondary endpoints were the overall response rate, duration of response, progression-free survival, and overall survival. No dose-limiting toxicities were observed. Of the 28 patients, seven (25%) experienced serious adverse events, but only one was attributed to vorbipiprant and one to balstilimab. The trial achieved a DCR of 50% observed across the entire cohort. In the subgroup of patients with liver metastases (n = 12), the DCR was 25%. The overall response rate was 11%, with three patients showing a partial response (median duration of response, 7.4 months). The median progression-free survival was 2.6 months, and the median overall survival was 14.2 months. Translational exploratory analyses suggested that vorbipiprant may boost response to anti-PD-1 in patients with immunogenic tumors. The combination of vorbipiprant and a PD-1 inhibitor (balstilimab) yielded sufficient activity in refractory pMMR/MSS mCRC, which is worthy of confirmation in future clinical trials in biomarker-enriched populations.",Pietrantonio F; Morano F; Niger M; Ghelardi F; Chiodoni C; Palazzo M; Nichetti F; Manca P; Cristarella E; Doldi V; Zaffaroni N; Sabella G; Brambilla N; Benincasa E; Giacovelli G; Vitalini C; Girolami F; Rovati LC,Molecular Immunology Unit; Department of Pathology; Department of Clinical Research; Molecular Pharmacology Unit; Department of Medical Oncology,

Preclinical studies suggested that targeting the angiogenic pathway may be beneficial in this disease. This randomized phase 2 trial enrolled patients with unresectable, locally advanced, recurrent, or metastatic thymic carcinoma. Patients were randomized to receive carboplatin-paclitaxel with or without ramucirumab. The primary end point was progression-free survival (PFS) and secondary end points included response by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, disease control, toxicity, and overall survival. The primary analysis was done using a one-sided 10%-level log-rank test. Target sample size was 66 patients. Between 2018 and 2022, 21 patients enrolled to ramucirumab plus carboplatin-paclitaxel (RCP, n = 8) and to the control arm (carboplatin-paclitaxel [CP], n = 13) with one patient on CP not meeting eligibility criteria. Owing to slow accrual, the study was terminated early by the Data and Safety Monitoring Board. Of the 20 eligible patients, eight on RCP and nine on CP received protocol treatment. PFS was not statistically different (hazard ratio = 0.51, 80% confidence interval [CI]: 0.24-1.09,  Accrual to this population is challenging, and the study was closed early because of feasibility. Although PFS was not statistically better with RCP, the hazard ratio was 0.51 and the lack of significance was likely due to small sample sizes. Notably, addition of ramucirumab to CP led to higher response rates than CP alone. Future research should consider exploring larger multicenter trials and other combinations to improve outcomes.

Current therapeutic strategies focus on blocking upstream tyrosine kinases to inhibit STAT3/5, but these kinase blockers are not selective against STAT3/5 activation and frequent resistance causes relapse, emphasizing the need for targeted drugs. We evaluated the efficacy of JPX-0700 and JPX-0750 as dual STAT3/5 binding inhibitors promoting protein degradation. JPX-0700/-0750 decreased the mRNA and protein levels of STAT3/5 targets involved in cancer survival, metabolism, and cell cycle progression, exhibiting nanomolar to low micromolar efficacy. They induced cell death and growth arrest in both AML/NKCL cell lines and primary AML patient blasts. We found that both AML/NKCL cells hijack STAT3/5 signaling through either upstream activating mutations in kinases, activating mutations in STAT3, mutational loss of negative STAT regulators, or genetic gains in anti-apoptotic, pro-proliferative, or epigenetic-modifying STAT3/5 targets. This emphasizes a vicious cycle for proliferation and survival through STAT3/5. Both JPX-0700/-0750 treatment reduced leukemic cell growth in human AML or NKCL xenograft mouse models significantly, being well tolerated by mice. Synergistic cell death was induced upon combinatorial use with approved chemotherapeutics in AML/NKCL cells.",Fleck R,Janpix,

Current CTC identification methods are based on immuno-labeling, which depends on the differential expression of specific antigens between the cancer cells and white blood cells. Here we present an antigen-independent CTC detection method utilizing a deep-learning-assisted single-cell biolaser. Single-cell lasers were measured from nucleic-acid-stained cells inside optical cavities. A Deep Cell-Laser Classifier (DCLC) was developed to detect tumor cells from a patient CTC-derived pancreatic cell line using their unique single-cell lasing mode patterns. We further showed that the knowledge learned from one type of pancreatic cancer cell line can be transferred to detect other pancreatic cancer cell lines by the DCLC in zero-shot. A sensitivity of 94.3% and a specificity of 99.9% were achieved. Finally, enumeration was performed on CTCs obtained from pancreatic cancer patients. We further demonstrated the DCLC's ability in zero-shot generalization of enumeration on lung cancer patients' CTCs. The counting trends were consistent with those observed using conventional immunofluorescence imaging techniques. Employing our DCLC model, single-cell lasers open new avenues for both future biological studies and clinical applications, including classification of cell types and identification of rare cells.",,,xsfan@umich.edu.

Here, we systematically characterize bacterial rRNA modifications upon exposure to diverse antibiotics using native RNA nanopore sequencing. To identify significant rRNA modification changes, we develop NanoConsensus, a novel pipeline that is robust across RNA modification types, stoichiometries and coverage, with very low false positive rates, outperforming all individual algorithms tested. We then apply NanoConsensus to characterize the rRNA modification landscape upon antibiotic exposure, finding that rRNA modification profiles are altered in the vicinity of A and P-sites of the ribosome, in an antibiotic-specific manner, possibly contributing to antibiotic resistance.

Healthy people often report abnormal bowel symptoms (ABS), including bloating, constipation, abdominal pain, and diarrhea, however, connections between these symptoms and the gut microbiota are poorly understood. Determining correlations between ABS and taxonomic groups may provide predictive value for using prebiotics to mitigate ABS in combination with stool microbiome testing. Post hoc analysis of a three-arm randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial evaluating the effects of 3.5 g and 7 g resistant potato starch (RPS) doses or placebo was conducted. The study population (n = 70) were healthy adults aged 18-69 years old living in and around Guelph, ON. Participants evaluated their stools using the Bristol Stool Chart and also recorded any ABS daily. The presence of ABS was compared between treatment arms at baseline and changes in ABS were compared within treatment arms over 1- and 4-week periods. Pearson correlation analysis was used to identify significant relationships between changes in ABS and changes in bacterial taxa. Abdominal pain, belching, bloating, constipation, diarrhea, gas, and feeling unwell were reported by participants at low levels at baseline. Neither RPS nor placebo had significant effects on mean ABS scores. However, we identified positive correlations between treatment-dependent changes in symptoms and changes in Granulicatella, Haemophilus, Lachnospira, Olsenella, Papillibacter, Turicibacter, unclassified Enterobacteriaceae, unclassified Fusobacteriaceae, unclassified Pasteurellaceae, and unclassified Gammaproteobacteria. We also identified negative correlations between treatment-dependent changes in symptoms and changes in Anaerotruncus, Dorea, RFN20, Victivallis, unclassified Coriobacteriaceae, and unclassified Oxalobacteraceae. These Pearson correlations were significant after correction for repeated testing. The mean relative abundance of these taxa did not change in response to treatment. Finally, macronutrient intake was unaffected by RPS or placebo treatments. Changes in ABS can be positively or negatively correlated with changes in specific gut microbiota, creating opportunities for personalized microbiome-targeted interventions to resolve ABS.

For the treatment of hereditary angioedema, C1 inhibitor and the antibody lanadelumab (directed against kallikrein) have also long been approved as biologics in addition to low-molecular substances. Other therapeutic antibodies are in various stages of development. Furthermore, the range of indications for some very effective biologics has been successfully expanded to include additional diseases. In this context, the first results on biologic therapy of food allergy and eosinophilic esophagitis are interesting. Biologics that address different target structures are also increasingly being administered in combination, either simultaneously or sequentially, in order to achieve optimal efficacy. A developing area is the use of biologics in children and the observation of immunological and non-immunological side effects. In some cases, new unexpected side effects and hypersensitivity reactions have emerged, which in turn raise pathomechanistic questions, such as conjunctivitis with dupilumab therapy, which only appears to occur in the treatment of atopic dermatitis but not in the treatment of other atopic diseases. In dermatology, paradoxical reactions have been described under therapy with some biologics.

A better detection of the infrequently occurring clinically significant prostate cancer (csPCa) in PI-RADS 3 lesions is an important objective. The purpose of this study was to evaluate if feature maps calculated from T2-weighted (T2w) 3 Tesla (3T) MRI can help detect csPCa in PI-RADS category 3 lesions. In-house biparametric 3T prostate MRI examinations acquired between January 2019 and June 2023 because of elevated prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels were retrospectively screened. Inclusion criteria were a PI-RADS 3 lesion and available results of an ultrasound-guided targeted and systematic biopsy. Exclusion criteria were a simultaneous PI-RADS category 4 or 5 lesion and hip replacement. Target lesions with the International Society of Urological Pathology (ISUP) grade group 1 were rated clinically insignificant PCa (ciPCa) and ≥2 csPCa. This resulted in 52 patients being included in the final analysis, of whom 11 (21.1%), 8 (15.4%), and 33 (63.5%) patients had csPCa, ciPCa, and no PCa, respectively, with the latter two groups being combined as non-csPCa. Eight of the csPCas were located in the peripheral zone (PZ) and three in the transition zone (TZ). In the non-csPCa group, 29 were located in the PZ and 12 in the TZ. Target lesions were marked with volumes of interest (VOIs) on axial T2w images. Axial T2w images were then converted to 93 feature maps. VOIs were copied into the maps, and feature quantity was retrieved directly. Features were tested for significant differences with the Mann-Whitney U-test. Univariate models for single feature performance and bivariate models implementing PSA density (PSAD) were calculated. Ten map-derived features differed significantly between the csPCa and non-csPCa groups (AUCs: 0.70-0.84). The diagnostic performance for TZ lesions (AUC: 0.83-1.00) was superior to PZ lesions (AUC: 0.74-0.85). In the bivariate models, performance in the PZ improved with AUCs >0.90 throughout. Parametric feature maps alone and as bivariate models with PSAD can (?) noninvasively identify csPCa in PI-RADS 3 lesions and could serve as a quantitative tool reducing ambiguity in PI-RADS 3 lesions.",,,

With the recent adoption of new nomenclature for SLD in humans, questions have arisen about how to integrate these changes into preclinical models. Here, we offer suggestions on how to improve preclinical models, including the incorporation of factors such as diet, alcohol, and other metabolic stressors, to better replicate the complexity of human disease. While implementing these improvements presents practical challenges, doing so is essential for enhancing the translational relevance and reproducibility of animal studies, and advancing therapeutic discoveries.

Local ablative techniques have been proposed to treat unresectable PC patients, although their impact on activating the host immune system and overcoming resistance to immunotherapy remains elusive. We dissected the immune-modulatory abilities triggered by local ablation in mouse and human PC models and human specimens, integrating phenotypic and molecular technologies with functional assays. Local ablation treatment performed in mice bearing orthotopic syngeneic PC tumours triggered tumour necrosis and a short-term inflammatory process characterised by the prompt increase of HMGB1 plasma levels, coupled with an enhanced amount of circulating and tumour infiltrating myeloid cells and increased MHCII expression in splenic myeloid antigen-presenting cells. Local ablation synergised with immunotherapy to restrict tumour progression and improved the survival of PC-bearing mice by evoking a T lymphocyte-dependent anti-tumour immune response. By integrating spatial transcriptomics with histological techniques, we pinpointed how combination therapy could reshape TME towards an anti-tumour milieu characterised by the preferential entrance and colocalization of activated T lymphocytes and myeloid cells endowed with antigen presentation features instead of T regulatory lymphocytes and CD206-expressing tumour-associated macrophages. In addition, treatment-dependent TME repolarization extended to neoplastic cells, promoting a shift from squamous to a more differentiated classical phenotype. Finally, we validated the immune regulatory properties induced by local ablation in PC patients and identified an association of the short-term treatment-dependent increase of neutrophils, NLR and HMGB1 with a longer time to progression. Therefore, local ablation might overcome the current limitations of immunotherapy in PC.",Agostini A; Busato A; Piro G; Carbone C,Assessment Department Aptuit S.r.l.; Medical Oncology,stefano.ugel@univr.it.

Tea polyphenols (TPs) can prevent obesity caused by HFD by modulating gut microbiota. To explore the function of TP in mitigating the effects of obesity and inflammation, mice are fed HFDs either with or without TP. TP supplementation effectively attenuates HFD-induced weight gain, liver and adipose tissue accumulation, while also improving liver fat content as well as colon and ileum tissue morphology. TP supplementation leads to a downregulation of lipid accumulation genes and an upregulation of lipid-decomposition genes. Moreover, TP increases Blautia and Faecalibaculum while reducing the Colidextribacter and short-chain fatty acids in HFD-induced mice, significantly activates G protein-coupled receptors, inhibits histone deacetylases, enhances intestinal tight junction expression levels, reduces intestinal permeability, and thereby preserves intestinal barrier integrity. Additionally, TP markedly suppresses the expression of inflammatory cytokines and inhibits the activation of TLR4 signaling pathways.

However, understanding enzymes require unravelling the intricate dynamic interplay between dynamics, conformational substates, and multiple protein structures. Here, we use single-molecule nanopore analysis to investigate the catalytic conformational changes of adenylate kinase (AK), an enzyme that catalyzes the interconversion of various adenosine phosphates (ATP, ADP, and AMP). Kinetic analysis validated by hidden Markov models unravels the details of domain motions during catalysis. Our findings reveal that allosteric interactions between ligands and cofactor enable converting binding energies into directional conformational changes of the two catalytic domains of AK. These coordinated motions emerged to control the exact sequence of ligand binding and the affinity for the three different substrates, thereby guiding the reactants along the reaction coordinates. Interestingly, we find that about 10% of enzymes show altered allosteric regulation and ligand affinities, indicating that a subset of enzymes folds in alternative catalytically active forms. Since molecules or proteins might be able to selectively stabilize one of the folds, this observation suggests an evolutionary path for allostery in enzymes. In AK, this complex catalytic framework has likely emerged to prevent futile ATP/ADP hydrolysis and to regulate the enzyme for different energy needs of the cell.",,,giovanni.maglia@rug.nl.

The study included patients with histologically or cytologically confirmed advanced and relapsed solid tumors, with measurable disease by Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) V.1.1. Patients were treated with escalating doses of IO-108 every 3 weeks (Q3W) as monotherapy and in combination with pembrolizumab. Safety and tolerability were the primary objectives. Secondary and exploratory objectives included: pharmacokinetics, clinical efficacy, immunogenicity and biomarkers. Of 25 patients enrolled, 12 were treated with IO-108 monotherapy and 13 received combination therapy. IO-108 was well-tolerated up to the maximally administered dose of 1,800 mg every 3 weeks (Q3W) as monotherapy and in combination with pembrolizumab. No dose-limiting toxicity was observed, and a maximum tolerated dose was not reached. Treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) occurred in 6 (50.0%) patients treated with IO-108 monotherapy and 6 (46.2%) patients treated with IO-108+pembrolizumab. All TRAEs were mild or moderate (Grade 1 or 2), and no TRAEs led to treatment discontinuation or death. IO-108 exhibited a dose-proportional increase in exposure. Full receptor occupancy (RO) in peripheral blood was achieved at doses ≥600 mg. The overall response rate was 9% (1/11) in the monotherapy and 23% (3/13) in the combination therapy. A patient with treatment-refractory Merkel cell carcinoma treated with IO-108 monotherapy achieved a durable complete response (CR) for more than 2 years. Pharmacodynamic gene expression changes reflecting increased tumor infiltration of T cells were associated with clinical benefits in both monotherapy and combination therapy. Additionally, baseline tumor inflammation gene signature (TIS) scores correlated with clinical benefit. IO-108 is well tolerated and has led to objective response as monotherapy and in combination with pembrolizumab. The complete response and the pharmacodynamic changes in the monotherapy cohort demonstrate single agent activity of IO-108 and provide proof of concept that targeting myeloid-suppressive pathways through LILRB2 inhibition may potentiate the clinical efficacy of anti-PD-1 immune checkpoint inhibitors.

Patients were treated with nivolumab and ipilimumab; the trial was opened at more than 1000 sites. Landmark Cox regression models were used to assess first cycle immune-related adverse event associations with PFS and overall survival. We found that grade 1-2 treatment-related immune-related adverse events in the first cycle of therapy were associated with longer overall survival (multivariable hazard ratio [HR] = 0.61, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.49 to 0.75; P < .001) compared with no treatment-related immune-related adverse event, while grade 3-4 immune-related adverse events were associated with shorter overall survival (HR = 1.41, 95% CI = 1.04 to 1.90; P = .025). Similar but weaker associations were observed with PFS and grade 1-2 treatment-related immune-related adverse events (HR = 0.83, 95% CI = 0.67 to 1.01; P = .067) and grade 3-4 (HR = 1.35, 95% CI = 1.02 to 1.78; P = .037) compared with no treatment-related immune-related adverse events. Grade 1-2 dermatologic toxicity was associated with improved overall survival compared with other grade 1-2 toxicities (HR = 0.67, 95% CI = 0.52 to 0.85; P = .002). There was no statistically significant overall survival difference between patients with grade 1-2 fatigue, gastrointestinal, metabolic, hepatic, endocrine, and thyroid toxicities vs other grade 1-2 toxicities. In this large cohort of patients with rare tumors receiving checkpoint inhibitor therapy, grade of immune-related adverse event in the first cycle was predictive for survival.",,,

We investigated how R(+) propranolol, the nonbeta blocker enantiomer of racaemic propranolol, affects lipid accumulation and adipogenesis in IH. This was motivated by our previous work showing that R(+) propranolol can block blood vessel formation in a preclinical model of IH. Our findings suggest a novel regulatory role for R(+) propranolol in modulating lipid accumulation in haemangioma stem cells. This highlights a novel role for R(+) propranolol in the involuting phase of IH and offers a strategy to reduce fibrofatty residua in IH.",,,

TROP2 has been recognized as a promising therapeutic target for antibody-drug conjugates (ADC), as evidenced by the approval of the anti-TROP2 ADC Trodelvy for the treatment of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). In this study, we report the generation of novel second-generation amanitin-based ADCs (ATAC) targeting TROP2, comprising the humanized RS7 antibody of Trodelvy (hRS7) and the highly potent payload amanitin. The specific in vitro binding, efficient antigen internalization, and high cytotoxicity of hRS7 ATACs with EC50 values in the picomolar range in TROP2-expressing cells constituted the foundation for preclinical in vivo evaluation. The hRS7 ATACs demonstrated a significant reduction in tumor growth in vivo in subcutaneous xenograft mouse models of pancreatic cancer and TNBC at well-tolerated doses. The antitumor efficacy correlated with the level of TROP2 expression on the tumors and the in vivo tumor uptake of the ATACs. The long half-life of 9.7 to 10.7 days of hRS7 ATACs without premature payload release in serum supported a high therapeutic index. Notably, the efficacy of the hRS7 ATACs was superior to that of Trodelvy with complete tumor eradication in both refractory pancreatic cancer and TNBC xenograft models. In summary, hRS7 ATACs represent a highly effective and well-tolerated targeted therapy, and our data support their development for pancreatic cancer and other TROP2-expressing tumors.",Papacharisi E; Braun AC; Vranic M; Pahl AM; Hechler T,Heidelberg Pharma Research GmbH; Heidelberg Pharma AG,

There is a need for DED treatment options that address tear evaporation and benefit patients across a broad range of demographic and disease characteristics. This study evaluated treatment effects of perfluorohexyloctane ophthalmic drop (formerly NOV03) in the pooled dataset from 2 pivotal clinical trials in patients with DED associated with MGD, both in the overall population and in patient subgroups based on sex, age, and baseline severity of eye dryness. Pooled data from 2 similarly designed, phase 3, randomized controlled trials (GOBI, MOJAVE) were analyzed. Patients aged ≥18 years with DED administered perfluorohexyloctane (n=614) or hypotonic (0.6% solution) saline control (n=603) four times daily for 8 weeks. Primary endpoints were total corneal fluorescein staining (tCFS) score (National Eye Institute scale, 0-15) and eye dryness visual analog scale (VAS) score (0-100). Efficacy was evaluated using analysis of covariance among patient subgroups (male and female, older [≥65 years] and younger [18 to <65 years], tCFS score <7 and ≥7, VAS eye dryness score <70 and ≥70, MGD score <7 and ≥7, Schirmer I test <10 mm and ≥10 mm). Reductions in tCFS and VAS eye dryness scores were greater for perfluorohexyloctane versus control. In the overall patient population, least-squares mean treatment difference was -1.1 (95% CI: -1.41 to -0.79; p<0.0001) for tCFS and -9.0 (95% CI: -11.90 to -6.00; p<0.0001) for VAS eye dryness. Treatment favored perfluorohexyloctane over control in all patient subgroup analyses of tCFS and VAS eye dryness. Overall, the most common adverse event with perfluorohexyloctane was blurred vision (2.1% of patients), which was mild and transient. Compared with a hypotonic saline control, perfluorohexyloctane improved both the signs and symptoms of DED, including in patients with greater self-reported severity of eye dryness.

Durvalumab is a PD-L1 inhibitor. The safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and preliminary antitumor activity of adavosertib plus durvalumab were evaluated in patients with refractory solid tumors to define the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended phase II dose (RP2D). This phase 1, non-randomized, open-label study determined MTD/RP2D using dose-escalation cohorts. Eligible patients had histologically confirmed tumors refractory to standard therapy or for which no standard of care existed. A total of 55 patients received adavosertib with durvalumab. Overall, 3/52 evaluable patients experienced dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs; two grade 3 nausea, one grade 3 diarrhea that did not respond to care within 48 h). The most frequent (in > 5% of patients) treatment-emergent grade ≥ 3 toxicities were fatigue, diarrhea, nausea, anemia, and abdominal pain. MTD for twice-daily (bid) adavosertib dosing was oral adavosertib 150 mg bid (3 days on/4 days off; treatment days 15-17 and 22-24 of a 28-day cycle) with intravenous durvalumab 1500 mg four times a week (Q4W), which was also the RP2D.

Infection by pathogenic bacteria causes damage to the intestinal barrier function of piglets, disrupts the balance of the intestinal microbiota, and destroys the chemical, mechanical, and immune barriers of the intestinal tract, which is one of the main causes of gut inflammation or gut diseases in piglets. The traditional method is to add antibiotics to piglet diets to prevent bacterial infections. However, long-term overuse of antibiotics leads to bacterial resistance and residues in animal products, threatening human health and causing gut microbiota dysbiosis. In this context, finding alternatives to antibiotics to maintain pre- and post-weaning gut health in piglets and prevent pathogenic bacterial infections becomes a real emergency. The utilization of probiotics in piglet nutrition has emerged as a pivotal strategy to promote gut health and defend against pathogenic infections, offering a sustainable alternative to traditional antibiotic usage. This review introduces recent findings that underscore the multifaceted roles of probiotics in enhancing piglet welfare, from fortifying the gut barrier to mitigating the impacts of common bacterial pathogens. Meanwhile, this study introduces the functions of probiotics from different perspectives: positive effects of probiotics on piglet gut health, protecting piglets against pathogen infection, and the mechanisms of probiotics in preventing pathogenic bacteria.",,,

Clinical oncology,10.1038/s41571-024-00959-y,"Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells are revolutionizing cancer therapy, particularly for haematological malignancies, conferring durable and sometimes curative responses in patients with advanced-stage disease. The CAR T cell products currently approved for clinical use are all autologous and are often effective; however, in patients who are lymphopenic and/or heavily pretreated with chemotherapy, autologous T cells can be difficult to harvest in sufficient numbers or have functional impairments that might ultimately render them less efficacious. Moreover, autologous products take several weeks to produce, and each product can be used in only one patient. By contrast, allogeneic CAR T cells can be produced for many patients using T cells from a single healthy donor, can be optimized for safety and efficacy, can be instantly available for 'off-the-shelf' use and, therefore, might also be more cost-effective. Despite these potential advantages, the development of allogeneic CAR T cells has lagged behind that of autologous products, owing to the additional challenges such as avoiding graft-versus-host disease and host-mediated graft rejection. Over the past few years, the development of advanced genome-editing techniques has facilitated the generation of novel allogeneic CAR T cell products. Furthermore, CAR cell products derived from other cell types such as induced pluripotent stem cells and natural killer cells are being investigated for clinical use. In this Review, we discuss the potential of allogeneic CAR cell products to expand life-saving immunotherapy to a much broader population of patients in the coming years, the progress made to date and strategies to overcome remaining hurdles.",,,GRUPP@chop.edu.

The etiology is largely unknown, but in a subset of patients with SPS, monoallelic pathogenic variants in RNF43 are detected. To date, however, the penetrance and phenotypic spectrum of patients carrying pathogenic variants (PV) in RNF43 are poorly described. We present eight patients both with and without serrated polyps from four unrelated families with likely pathogenic variants (LPV) in RNF43 and compare the results to current literature. The patients were referred to genetic counseling due to suspicion of hereditary cancer. They underwent genetic testing with custom NGS gene panels including RNF43 as part of a routine genetic work-up. Three LPVs, one multi-exon deletion and two nonsense variants, were detected in four families. Family I had a history of CRC and serrated polyps, but in the three other families (II‒IV) there was no history of CRC or serrated polyps. Colonoscopies in the probands of these families did not reveal any serrated polyps and/or CRC despite some of them being relatively old. Our findings suggest that the penetrance of RNF43-related disease is much lower than previously thought, and raise questions about the connection between RNF43 and disease. The results highlight the complexity of genetic counseling in RNF43 positive families- particularly in families without polyposis.

NK cells have emerged as a promising option for the treatment of MM. NK cells are heterogenous and typically classified based on the relative expression of their surface markers (e.g., CD56 and CD16a). These cells elicit an antitumor response in the presence of low mutational burden and without neoantigen presentation via germline-encoded activating and inhibitory receptors that identify the markers of transformation present on the MM cells. Higher NK cell activity is associated with improved survival and prognosis, whereas lower activity is associated with advanced clinical stage and disease progression in MM. Moreover, not all NK cell phenotypes contribute equally toward the anti-MM effect; higher proportions of certain NK cell phenotypes result in better outcomes. In MM, the proportion, phenotype, and function of NK cells are drastically varied between different disease stages; this is further influenced by the bone marrow microenvironment, proportion of activating and inhibitory receptors on NK cells, expression of homing receptors, and bone marrow hypoxia. Antimyeloma therapies, such as autologous stem cell transplant, immunomodulation, proteasome inhibition, and checkpoint inhibition, further modulate the NK cell landscape in the patients. Thus, NK cells can naturally work in tandem with anti-MM therapies and be strategically modulated for improved anti-MM effect. This review article describes immunotypic and phenotypic differences in NK cells along with the functional changes in homeostatic and malignant states and provides expert insights on strategies to harness the potential of NK cells for improving outcomes in MM.",Bisht K; Igarashi R; Gauthier L; Chiron M; Desjonqueres A; Vivier E; van de Velde H,Research and Development; Innate Pharma Research Laboratories,kamlesh.bisht@sanofi.com.

It is in clinical development in combination with budigalimab, an anti-programmed cell death protein 1 Fc-modified mAb. The first-in-human, phase 1, dose-escalation results are presented herein (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT03821935). The dose-escalation phase enrolled adult patients with advanced solid tumors. Patients received escalating doses of livmoniplimab ranging from 3mg to 1500mg, once every 2 weeks (Q2W), as monotherapy or in combination with a 500mg fixed dose of budigalimab Q4W. The primary objective of the dose escalation was to determine the recommended phase 2 dose. Secondary objectives were to assess safety and pharmacokinetics (PK), and exploratory objectives included evaluating preliminary efficacy. Fifty-seven patients enrolled in the dose escalation: 23 in monotherapy cohorts and 34 in combination therapy cohorts. Dose-limiting toxicities were limited, no maximum tolerated dose was reached, and the maximum administered dose of 1500mg was selected for dose expansion. The most common adverse events reported in monotherapy-treated patients were fatigue, anemia, and nausea, and those in combination therapy-treated patients were pruritus, fatigue, nausea, and anemia. Livmoniplimab exhibited dose-proportional PK, and peripheral blood biomarker data demonstrated saturation of the GARP:TGF-ß1 complex on platelets at livmoniplimab doses within the linear PK range. No objective tumor responses were observed in the monotherapy dose escalation. However, the objective response rate was 15% in the combination dose escalation, with a median response duration of 8.4 months.

However, there is no firm evidence on which variables best predict mortality in hospitalized patients receiving active systemic treatment. Our main goal was to develop a predictive model for 90-day mortality upon admission. Between 2020 and 2022, we prospectively collected data from three sites for cancer patients with hospitalizations. Those with metastatic disease receiving systemic therapy in the 6 months before unplanned admission were eligible to this study. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) method was used to select the most relevant factors to predict 90-day mortality at admission. A multivariable logistic regression was fitted to create the PROgnostic Score for Hospitalized Cancer Patients (PROMISE) score. The score was developed in a single-center training cohort and externally validated. Of 1658 hospitalized patients, 1009 met eligibility criteria. Baseline demographics, patient and disease characteristics were similar across cohorts. Lung cancer was the most common tumor type in both cohorts. Factors associated with higher 90-day mortality included worse ECOG, stable/progressive disease, low levels of albumin, increased absolute neutrophil count, and high lactate dehydrogenase.

Integrated machine learning models were developed to predict the conversion risk of normal cognition (NC) to mild cognitive impairment (MCI) over a 6-year follow-up. The cerebellar models outperformed hippocampal models in distinguishing MCI from NC and in predicting transitions from NC to MCI across both cohorts. Key predictors included textural features in the right III and left I and II lobules, and network properties in Vermis I and II, which were associated with cognitive decline in AD. Cerebellum-derived radiomic-network modeling shows promise as a tool for early identification and prediction of disease progression during the preclinical stage of AD. Altered cerebellar radiomic features and topological networks were identified in the subjects with mild cognitive impairment (MCI).

This post hoc analysis of a phase 2b study was undertaken to understand the disease burden and to assess the impact of rocatinlimab on patient-reported outcomes (PROs). This analysis used baseline data from a multicenter, randomized, double-blind study of adults with moderate-to-severe AD, who completed a Worst Pruritus numerical rating scale (NRS), Sleep Disturbance NRS, and the Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI). A mixed model for repeated measures was used to estimate changes in PRO scores from baseline; scores were also compared with clinically meaningful change benchmarks. The analysis included 267 subjects, mean (SD) age 37.9 (14.7) years, 40.8% female; 55.1% grade 3 and 44.9% grade 4 Investigator Global Assessment for AD. Mean (SD) scores were: Worst Pruritus NRS 7.5 (1.9), Sleep Disturbance NRS 5.5 (2.9), DLQI total score 12.6 (7.1). Worst Pruritus and Sleep NRS scores had low positive correlations with SCORing AD (SCORAD) score (r = 0.44, r = 0.45 respectively) and negligible correlations with Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) score and area affected (r < 0.30).

In this study, we report extended follow-up data from the INTEGA trial (NCT03409848), which investigated the efficacy of the anti-PD-1 nivolumab, trastuzumab, and FOLFOX chemotherapy (FOLFOX arm) in comparison with a chemotherapy-free regimen involving nivolumab, trastuzumab, and the anti-CTLA-4 ipilimumab (Ipi arm) in the first-line setting for advanced disease. The 12-month overall survival (OS) showed no statistical difference between the arms, with 57% OS (95% confidence interval, 41%-71%) in the Ipi arm and 70% OS (95% confidence interval, 54%-82%) in the FOLFOX arm. Crossing of the survival curves indicated a potential long-term benefit for some patients within the Ipi arm, but early progressors in the Ipi arm underlined the need for biomarker-guided strategies to optimize treatment selection. To this end, metabolomic and cytokine analyses demonstrated elevated levels of normetanephrine, cortisol, and IL6 in immunotherapy-unresponsive patients in the Ipi arm, suggesting a role for systemic inflammatory stress in modulating antitumor immune responses. Patients with this signature also showed an increased neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio that persisted in the Ipi arm, but not in the FOLFOX arm, and strongly correlated with survival. Furthermore, a low neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio characterized patients benefiting from immunotherapy and targeted therapy without the need for additional chemotherapy. These data suggest that patient selection based on inflammatory stress-driven immune changes could help customize first-line treatment in patients with advanced HER2-positive esophagogastric adenocarcinoma to potentially improve long-term survival.",Jacobasch L; Kretzschmar A; Kubicka S; Hinke A; Hegewisch-Becker S,CCRC; Practice for Hematology - Oncology; Kreisklinik Reutlingen; MVZ-Mitte; Hematology-Oncology Practice Eppendorf (HOPE),

These techniques have recently been adapted for small animal use in a novel 3D in vivo imaging system capable of high-throughput automated scanning. Our goal was to evaluate the feasibility of using this imaging tool in the murine Western diet (WD) model, a highly translatable preclinical model of obesity, metabolic disease and liver fibrosis. Female C57BL/6 mice (N = 48) were placed on WD or chow diet and imaged longitudinally for a period of 48 weeks. Imaging consisted of 3D B-mode and targeted SWE captures. Liver volume, liver echogenicity and liver stiffness were quantified from in vivo imaging data. A subset of mice was sacrificed at various timepoints (0, 12, 24 and 48 weeks) for histological workup. Correlation analysis was performed between in vivo imaging and histological measurements to determine level of agreement. Noninvasive imaging showed statistically significant increases in liver volume and echogenicity, but non-significant increase in liver stiffness in the WD-fed cohort, suggesting development of hepatomegaly and steatosis, but negligible fibrosis. Ex vivo analysis confirmed significant increases in liver weight, liver triglycerides and ALT, but limited increases in fibrosis corroborating noninvasive imaging results. Correlation analysis between imaging and histology demonstrated good agreement between liver volume/liver weight (R This study demonstrated that noninvasive ultrasound liver assessments are feasible in the WD mouse model and closely reflect the underlying pathological state of the animal.

Segmenting the disease course [time to recurrence, recurrence to metastasis, and post-metastasis survival (PMS)] may identify disease states for which the greatest impacts can be made to ultimately improve survival. Evaluate real-world PMS of patients with HR-LPC/LAPC who received primary radical prostatectomy (RP) or radiotherapy (RT) with or without androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). Electronic health records from an oncology database were used to assess PMS. Risk of death was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Hazard ratios (HRs) were used to analyze the impact of treatment and time to metastasis (TTM) on PMS. Standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) were calculated for patients with HR-LPC/LAPC versus the US general male population. Overall, 5008 patients with HR-LPC/LAPC were identified, and 1231 developed metastases after primary treatment (RP, n = 885; RT only, n = 262; RT+ADT, n = 84). Age-adjusted PMS HR between the RP and RT only cohorts was 1.19 (p = 0.077) and between RP and RT+ADT cohorts was 1.32 (p = 0.078). TTM was unrelated to PMS in unadjusted (HR 1.01, p = 0.2) and age-adjusted models (HR 0.99, p = 0.3). Relative to pre-metastasis SMRs, post-metastasis SMRs increased eightfold and fivefold in patients treated with RP and RT±ADT, respectively. PMS was unrelated to TTM in patients with HR-LPC/LAPC, suggesting PMS may be independent of the trajectory to development of metastases. Given PMS may be a fixed length of time, delaying the development of metastasis may improve survival in patients with HR-LPC/LAPC.",Fernandes L; De Solda F; Buyukkaramikli N; Mundle SD; McCarthy SA; Labson D; Yang L; Pan F,Clinical Research Oncology; Global Medical Affairs; Global Commercial Strategy Organization,Stephen.Freedland@cshs.org.

Therefore, we investigated the genetic background of lifetime productivity in high-producing dairy cattle by integrating genomics and transcriptomics datasets. A total of 3,365,612 test-day milk yield records from 134,029 Chinese Holstein cows were used to define 6 lifetime productivity traits, including lifetime milk yield covering full lifespan and 5 cumulative milk yield traits covering partial lifespan. Genetic parameters were estimated based on univariate and bivariate linear animal models and the restricted maximum likelihood method. Genome-wide association studies and weighted gene co-expression network analyses (WGCNA) were performed to identify candidate genes associated with lifetime productivity based on genomic data from 3,424 cows and peripheral blood RNA-sequencing data from 23 cows, respectively. Lifetime milk yield averaged 24,800.8 ± 14,396.6 kg (mean ± SD) across an average of 2.4 parities in Chinese Holstein population. The heritability estimates for lifetime productivity traits ranged from 0.05 (±0.01 for SE) to 0.10 (±0.02 for SE). The estimate of genetic correlation between lifetime milk yield and productive life is 0.88 (±0.3 for SE), whereas the genetic correlation with 305-d milk yield in the first lactation was 0.49 (±0.08 for SE). Absolute values for most genetic correlation estimates between lifetime productivity and type traits were lower than 0.30. Moderate genetic correlations were found between udder related traits and lifetime productivity, such as with udder depth (0.33), rear udder attachment height (0.33), and udder system (0.34). Some single nucleotide polymorphisms and gene co-expression modules significantly associated with lifetime milk yield were identified based on GWAS and WGCNA analyses, respectively. Functional enrichment analyses of the candidate genes identified revealed important pathways related to immune system, longevity, energy utilization, and metabolism, and FoxO signaling. The genes NTMT1, FNBP1, and S1PR1 were considered to be the most important candidate genes influencing lifetime productivity in Holstein cows. Overall, our findings indicate that lifetime productivity is heritable in Chinese Holstein cattle, and important candidate genes were identified by integrating genomic and transcriptomic datasets.",Guo G; Yan Q; Chen S,Dairy Association of China; Beijing Sunlon Livestock Development Company Limited,gxxwm@126.com.

Gastroenterology & hepatology,10.1016/S2468-1253(24)00248-6,"IMU-856 is an orally available and systemically acting small molecule modulator of sirtuin 6 (SIRT6), a protein that serves as a transcriptional regulator of bowel epithelium regeneration. We aimed to evaluate the safety, clinical activity, pharmacodynamics, and pharmacokinetics of IMU-856 in healthy participants and in patients with coeliac disease. This study reports the results from a completed first-in-human, three-part, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled, clinical trial of IMU-856 in healthy participants and patients with coeliac disease done in Australia and New Zealand. In part A, healthy participants were enrolled in six cohorts and randomly assigned (3:1) using a block randomisation algorithm to receive single ascending doses of IMU-856 ranging from 10 mg to 160 mg or matching placebo. Based on the results from part A, three doses were selected for part B to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of IMU-856 once daily for 14 days using the same randomisation algorithm. Part C enrolled patients with well controlled coeliac disease. Participants were centrally randomised 1:1:1 using an interactive web response system to receive either low dose or high dose of IMU-856 or placebo once daily for 28 days that included a 15-day gluten challenge starting on day 14. The primary objective was safety and tolerability of IMU-856. Safety analyses were done on all patients who received at least one dose of the study drug. The trial is registered with the ANZCTR registry (ACTRN12620000901909). Between July 27, 2020, and Oct 28, 2022, 71 healthy participants were enrolled in part A and B and assigned to either placebo (n=19) or IMU-856 (n=52). In part A and B, the IMU-856 doses were 10 mg (n=6), 20 mg (n=6), 40 mg (n=13), 80 mg (n=12), 120 mg (n=4), 160 mg (n=11). 43 patients with coeliac disease were enrolled in part C and assigned to either placebo (n=14), IMU-856 80 mg (n=14), or IMU-856 160 mg (n=15). Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) occurred in 24 (73%) of 33 participants in part A and 15 (79%) of 19 participants in part B receiving any dose of IMU-856 compared with six (50%) of 12 participants in part A and five (71%) of seven participants in part B with placebo. TEAEs were mainly mild in severity. In part C, TEAEs occured in 26 (90%) of 29 patients on any dose of IMU-856 and ten (71%) of 14 receiving placebo; the most common TEAEs with any dose of IMU-856 by preferred term were headache (13 [45%] of 29), nausea (nine [31%]), diarrhoea (eight [28%]), and abdominal distension (seven [24%]). Two serious adverse events occurred with IMU-856 treatment (one in part B [bacterial myocarditis] and one in part C [biliary colic]), both of which were unrelated to IMU-856. No dose-limiting toxicities, systematic safety laboratory changes, or deaths occurred during the study. In part C, mean decrease in villous height was -20·9 μm (SD 34·8) among patients who received IMU-856 80 mg, -22·5 μm (51·1) among those who received IMU-856 160 mg, and -60·3 μm (52·2) among those who received placebo. The favourable safety profile, along with preliminary activity, suggests that IMU-856 should be studied in future trials of coeliac disease.

Successful infection requires an efficient energy source that the pathogen obtains from rice plants, such as carbohydrates. Glycoside hydrolases (GHs), one of the largest sub-families in the cell wall-degrading enzyme family, play a key role in the infection progress of pathogens. To investigate their roles in facilitating infection, in this study, we identified and characterized genes encoding GH family proteins of T. horrida and further explored the functions and structures of these genes. Through genome-wide sequencing and bioinformatics analyses, 52 GH genes were identified from T. horrida, named ThGhd_1 to ThGhd_52. The subcellular location, conserved motifs, and structures of ThGhds were identified by bioinformatics analyses. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that ThGhds with similar domains clustered together, although some proteins clustered in different branches, which might reflect functional diversity. Protein-protein interaction network analysis revealed that ThGhds interact with partner proteins involved in reactive oxygen species signaling, protein kinase activity, and plant hormone signal transduction pathways. RNA-sequencing analysis showed that the expression of ThGhd genes responded differently at different infection time points, with dynamic changes detected during the T. horrida infection process, indicating that these genes are involved in interactions with rice and have potential roles in pathogenic mechanisms. The results of this study provide valuable resources for the structure elucidation of GH family proteins of T. horrida and can help to further elucidate their roles in pathogenesis.",Zhong Y,Hubei Huichzhi Biotech Company,yindesuo@163.com.

We used the European Melanoma Registry (EUMelaReg), a disease entity-based registry specific for melanoma, to examine treatment and outcomes for adult patients with stage III melanoma with lymph node involvement who had complete resection and received adjuvant treatment with pembrolizumab. The primary objectives were to describe the demographic and clinical characteristics of the included patients as well as time on adjuvant pembrolizumab treatment (TOT), real-world recurrence-free survival (RFS) and distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS) from adjuvant pembrolizumab initiation. Secondary objectives were time to next treatment (TTNT) after adjuvant use of pembrolizumab, next-line therapy for stage III and unresectable stage IV melanoma and overall survival (OS) from initiation of pembrolizumab. Patients were stratified according to age, sex, BRAF status, number of positive lymph nodes and disease substage. Median TOT was 11.1 (9.2-11.5) months, median RFS was 29.6 [18.7-not reached (NR)] months and median DMFS was 32.4 (22.7-NR) months. TTNT was 29.9 (22.2-NR) months, while median OS was not reached.

We evaluated the efficacy and safety of directly switching patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis and a suboptimal response to interleukin (IL)-17 inhibitors (secukinumab or ixekizumab) to risankizumab. This 52-week, phase 3b study enrolled patients (≥ 18 years) with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis who had previously been treated with the recommended dose of secukinumab or ixekizumab for ≥ 6 months but did not achieve an optimal response (static Physician's Global Assessment [sPGA] 2/3; body surface are [BSA] 3- < 10%). Patients received subcutaneous risankizumab (150 mg) without washout. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients achieving sPGA of 0/1 at week 16. Secondary endpoints included sPGA 0/1 at week 52, sPGA 0, Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) 0/1, and Psoriasis Symptoms Scale (PSS) 0 at weeks 16 and 52. Safety was monitored throughout the study. The study included 244 patients. sPGA 0/1 was achieved by 57.4% and 62.3% at week 16 and 52. At week 16, sPGA 0, DLQI 0/1, and PSS 0 were achieved by 20.5%, 40.2%, and 20.9%, respectively. At week 52, these proportions increased to 27.1% for sPGA 0, 47.2% for DLQI 0/1, and 27.5% for PSS 0. Most frequently reported adverse events (reported in ≥ 5% of patients) in risankizumab-treated patients were COVID-19 infection (8.6%) and nasopharyngitis (5.7%). No new safety signals were observed.

GBC has worse prognosis than non-GBC, but reasons behind are not clear. The GEICAM/2012-03 Study (Molecular Characterization of Gestational Breast Cancer) is a multicenter prospective/retrospective observational registry of patients diagnosed with GBC. From November 2014 to June 2015 seventy patients diagnosed with GBC were included in the study, 30 diagnosed during pregnancy and 40 after delivery. Our current study was aimed to explore differences in epidemiological, clinico-pathological and gene expression features of GBC tumors, from the GEICAM/2012-03 Study, compared to non-GBC tumors from patients of similar age (< 43 years) from six different GEICAM studies, used as non- GBC control population. As per the main objective, the study found multiple differences showing GBC tumors as a different biological entity. GBC showed a more aggressive biology, with higher Ki67 levels, higher incidence of breast and/or ovarian cancer family history, and germline deleterious BRCA1/2 mutations, and are enriched in basal-like intrinsic subtype. GBC patients showed a lower number of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes, while specific genetic signatures highlight differences in GBC´s distinctive transcriptome. Our study shows that GBC is potentially a clinically and molecularly different entity, with specific epidemiological, clinical, and histological features, as well as a distinctive altered immune state and genetic signature.

A novel scoring system for ranking HLA mismatches for these donors was investigated. High-resolution HLA types were used to determine amino acid mismatches located in the HLA antigen-recognition domain. The location and physicochemical properties of mismatched amino acids were used to assign scores for peptide binding, T-cell receptor docking, and HLA structure/function. The scores were tested using a cohort of 2319 patients with leukemia or myelodysplastic syndrome who received their first unrelated donor transplant using conventional graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis between 2000 and 2014. Donors were 7/8 HLA-matched with a single HLA Class I mismatch. Primary outcomes were overall survival and acute GVHD. The scores did not significantly (p < 0.01) associate with transplant outcomes, although a Peptide Score = 0 (i.e., no differences in peptide binding; N = 146, 6.3%) appears to have lower transplant-related mortality (TRM) compared to higher scores (p = 0.019). HLA mismatches with Peptide Score = 0 were predominately HLA-C*03:03/03:04 (62%), previously reported to be a permissive mismatch, and a group of 28 other HLA mismatches (38%) that showed similar associations with TRM. This study suggests that HLA mismatches that do not alter peptide binding or orientation (Peptide Score = 0) could expand the number of permissive HLA mismatches. Further investigation is needed to confirm this observation and to explore alternative scoring systems for ranking HLA mismatched donors.",Gadalla SM,Division of Cancer Epidemiology & Genetics,

The COVID-19 pandemic provided a singular opportunity to evaluate how influenza circulation worldwide was perturbed by human behavioral changes. We combine molecular, epidemiological, and international travel data and find that the pandemic's onset led to a shift in the intensity and structure of international influenza lineage movement. During the pandemic, South Asia played an important role as a phylogenetic trunk location of influenza A viruses, whereas West Asia maintained the circulation of influenza B/Victoria. We explore drivers of influenza lineage dynamics across the pandemic period and reasons for the possible extinction of the B/Yamagata lineage. After a period of 3 years, the intensity of among-region influenza lineage movements returned to pre-pandemic levels, with the exception of B/Yamagata, after the recovery of global air traffic, highlighting the robustness of global lineage dispersal patterns to substantial perturbation.",du Plessis L,Department of Biosystems Science and Engineering,

This study links macroscale tau deposition in the human brain to cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flow dynamics using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI). Low-frequency (< 0.1 Hz) resting-state global brain activity is coupled with CSF flow and potentially reflects CSF dynamics-related clearance. We examined the correlation between rsfMRI measures of CSF inflow and global activity (gBOLD-CSF coupling) as a predictor, interacting with amyloid beta (Aβ), of tau and cortical thickness (dependent variables) across Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) participants from cognitively unimpaired through mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). Tau deposition in Aβ+ participants, accompanied by cortical thinning and cognitive decline, is associated with decreased gBOLD-CSF coupling. Tau mediates the relationship between coupling and thickness. Findings suggest that resting-state global brain activity and CSF movements comodulate Alzheimer's tau deposition, presumably related to CSF clearance. A non-invasive functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) assessment of a CSF clearance-related process is carried out. Global brain activity is coupled with CSF inflow in human fMRI during resting state. Global fMRI-CSF coupling is correlated with tau in Alzheimer's disease (AD). This coupling measure is also associated with cortical thickness, mediated by tau.",,,

Patients received the drug loncastuximab tesirine, or Lonca for short, which targets a marker on the surface of tumor cells called CD19.Patient information from the LOTIS-2 study, other studies of Lonca, and information from scientific publications was used to develop a quantitative systems pharmacology (QSP) model, which can predict how Lonca works in the body. The goal was to use the QSP model to see if CD19 levels can predict tumor size changes after Lonca treatment and if Lonca can still work to treat DLBCL when CD19 levels are very low. The prior LOTIS-1 and LOTIS-2 trials demonstrated an acceptable safety profile for Lonca, and therefore the current study did not evaluate safety data. Researchers used immunohistochemistry, a common technique to evaluate CD19 expression. They found that there was no association between patients who responded to Lonca treatment and levels of CD19 on their tumor cells. Some patients with low or even undetectable levels of CD19 on their tumor cells had observable decreases in tumor size after Lonca treatment. While Lonca uses the CD19 target to find and destroy cancer cells, Lonca does not require a large amount of CD19 to kill tumor cells. These results mean that Lonca may be an effective treatment for patients with DLBCL, even if CD19 expression in tumors is undetectable by immunohistochemistry.",Nickaeen M; Jordie E; Utsey K; Knab T; Zammarchi F; Cucchi D; Pantano S; Havenith K; Boni J,ADC Therapeutics (United Kingdom) Ltd; ADC Therapeutics; Metrum Research Group; ADC Therapeutics SA,

Here, we show that BACH1, a transcription repressor of antioxidant response genes, features two distinct unconventional degrons encrypted in the quaternary structure of its homodimeric BTB domain. These two degrons are both functionalized by oxidative stress and are deciphered by two complementary E3s. FBXO22 recognizes a degron constructed by the BACH1 BTB domain dimer interface, which is unmasked from transcriptional co-repressors after oxidative stress releases BACH1 from chromatin. When this degron is impaired by oxidation, a second BACH1 degron manifested by its destabilized BTB dimer is probed by a pair of FBXL17 proteins that remodels the substrate into E3-bound monomers for ubiquitination. Our findings highlight the multidimensionality of protein degradation signals and the functional complementarity of different ubiquitin ligases targeting the same substrate.",,,michele.pagano@nyumc.org.

AD manifestations can impact variable anatomic regions, and involvement of the head and neck, a sensitive, hard-to-treat area, can negatively impact quality of life. In this post hoc analysis, we investigated response to rocatinlimab treatment across anatomic regions, including the head and neck. Least squares mean change from baseline to Week 56 in EASI score was analyzed by anatomic region (head and neck, trunk, upper extremities, or lower extremities) for patients with baseline moderate-to-severe AD in the respective anatomic region, using mixed models for repeated measures. Rocatinlimab groups were compared with placebo at Week 16. The proportion of patients achieving at least 75% reduction from baseline in EASI (EASI-75) was calculated. Probability of relapsing in EASI-75 during the off-treatment follow-up period (Weeks 36-56) was estimated using a Kaplan - Meier approach. At Week 16, decrease from baseline in mean EASI score was greater with all rocatinlimab regimens versus placebo across all anatomic regions for patients with baseline moderate-to-severe AD in the respective region (all P < 0.001). EASI scores continued to improve on treatment after Week 16 and were maintained during the off-treatment period across all regions. Among patients with baseline moderate-to-severe AD in the head and neck (n = 219; rocatinlimab, n = 174; placebo, n = 45), mean difference (rocatinlimab vs placebo) at Week 16 in LS mean percent change in head and neck EASI score ranged from - 30.4% to - 42.6% across treatment regimens. In patients who received rocatinlimab from the start of the trial, 47% - 71% achieved EASI-75 in the head and neck at Week 36. Among EASI-75 responders at Week 36, the probability of relapsing in EASI-75 in any region was low (< 25% in the head and neck) 20 weeks after treatment discontinuation until Week 56.Rocatinlimab treatment led to durable improvements in AD across multiple anatomic regions, including the sensitive head and neck region.",Esfandiari E; Mano H; Arai T; Chong C,Kyowa Kirin; Kyowa Kirin International,ehsanollah.esfandiari@kyowakirin.com.

The general consensus in the field is that rRNA modifications are largely species-specific, with most previous works and databases solely stratifying modifications by the species of origin, without taking other levels of complexity into account. However, new evidence has emerged suggesting dynamic rRNA modifications may have additional layers of complexity and might play an important role in development and disease. In this review article, we summarize recent evidence supporting heterogeneity and dynamics in rRNA modifications in diverse biological contexts, challenging the simplistic view of 'one-species-one-rRNA-modification-pattern'. Moreover, we highlight how rRNA modification dynamics have been studied to date and how long-read sequencing methods can significantly improve our understanding of this largely unexplored yet highly abundant RNA family, across tissues, developmental stages, and diseases.",,,eva.novoa@crg.eu.
39499074,Evaluating methods for identifying and quantifying ,,Microbiology spectrum,10.1128/spectrum.03643-23,"Detection of multiple pneumococcal serotype carriage can enhance monitoring of pneumococcal vaccine impact, particularly among high-burden childhood populations. We assessed methods for identifying co-carriage of pneumococcal serotypes from whole-genome sequences. Twenty-four nasopharyngeal samples were collected during community carriage surveillance from healthy children in Blantyre, Malawi, which were then serotyped by microarray. Pneumococcal DNA from culture plate sweeps were sequenced using Illumina MiSeq, and genomic serotyping was carried out using SeroCall and PneumoKITy. Their sensitivity was calculated in reference to the microarray data. Local maxima in the single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) density distributions were assessed for their correspondence to the relative abundance of serotypes. Across the 24 individuals, the microarray detected 77 non-unique serotypes, of which 42 occurred at high relative abundance (>10%) (per individual, median, 3; range, 1-6 serotypes). The average sequencing depth was 57X (range: 21X-88X). The sensitivity of SeroCall for identifying high-abundance serotypes was 98% (95% CI, 0.87-1.00), 20% (0.08-0.36) for low abundance (<10%), and 62% (0.50-0.72) overall. PneumoKITy's sensitivity was 86% (0.72-0.95), 20% (0.06-0.32), and 56% (0.42-0.65), respectively. Local maxima in the SNP frequency distribution were highly correlated with the relative abundance of high-abundance serotypes. Six samples were resequenced, and the pooled runs had an average fourfold increase in sequencing depth. This allowed genomic serotyping of two of the previously undetectable seven low-abundance serotypes. Genomic serotyping is highly sensitive for the detection of high-abundance serotypes in samples with co-carriage. Serotype-associated reads may be identified through SNP frequency, and increased read depth can increase sensitivity for low-abundance serotype detection.IMPORTANCEPneumococcal carriage is a prerequisite for invasive pneumococcal disease, which is a leading cause of childhood pneumonia. Multiple carriage of unique pneumococcal serotypes at a single time point is prevalent among high-burden childhood populations. This study assessed the sensitivity of different genomic serotyping methods for identifying pneumococcal serotypes during co-carriage. These methods were evaluated against the current gold standard for co-carriage detection. The results showed that genomic serotyping methods have high sensitivity for detecting high-abundance serotypes in samples with co-carriage, and increasing sequencing depth can increase sensitivity for low-abundance serotypes. These results are important for monitoring vaccine impact, which aims to reduce the prevalence of specific pneumococcal serotypes. By accurately detecting and identifying multiple pneumococcal serotypes in carrier populations, we can better evaluate the effectiveness of vaccination programs.",Hinds J; Sheppard C; Gould K; Brown C; Msefula J; Mataya AA; French N,Malawi Liverpool Wellcome Research Programme; BUGS Bioscience; Vaccine Preventable Bacteria Section,

It is characterized by degeneration and loss of articular cartilage, synovial inflammation, and subchondral bone sclerosis, leading to pain and functional impairment. After age, obesity is a major modifiable risk factor for OA, and it has recently been identified as a chronic disease by the World Health Organization (WHO). Obesity is associated with high morbidity and mortality, imposing a significant cost on individuals and society. Obesity increases the risk of knee OA through increased joint loading, altered body composition, and elevated pro-inflammatory adipokines in the systemic circulation. Moreover, obesity triggers fibrotic processes in different organs and tissues, including those involved in OA. Fibrosis in OA refers to the abnormal accumulation of fibrous tissue within and around the joints. It can be driven by increased adiposity, low-grade inflammation, oxidative stress, and metabolic alterations. However, the clinical outcomes of fibrosis in OA are unclear. This review focuses on the link between obesity and OA, explores the mechanism of obesity-driven fibrosis, and examines potential therapeutic opportunities for targeting fibrotic processes in OA.",,,

However, off-label prescribing is common, especially in children and adolescents (youth) in whom aripiprazole therapeutic serum level reference ranges are lacking for any disorders. The aim of the study was to evaluate the relationship between aripiprazole dose and serum concentrations and provide further knowledge on the use of aripiprazole in order to improve drug safety and effectiveness in the treatment of minors. The clinical course of youth treated with aripiprazole in the multicentre pharmacovigilance study TDM-VIGIL was systematically followed and serum concentrations measured. Sex, age, weight and comedications were analysed to identify possible effect modifiers. A preliminary therapeutic reference range was estimated for youth with schizophrenia-spectrum disorders, affective disorders and behavioural/emotional/tic disorders coded as treatment responders based on a Clinical-Global Impressions-Improvement (CGI-I) score of much or very much improved. In 93 youth (mean age = 15.2 ± 2.6, range = 7.4-18.2 years, females = 53%, CGI-Severity = 4.4 ± 1.1, responders = 64%), a positive, moderate correlation between the weight-normalized daily dose (WNDD) and aripiprazole serum concentration (=0.791, p < 0.0001) was found. The WNDD and co-medications that interact with CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 affected aripiprazole serum levels, explaining 64% of the variance. In patients within the preliminary therapeutic ranges determined by interquartile ranges (IQRs), slightly better outcomes and fewer adverse drug reactions were found versus patients within preliminary therapeutic ranges determined by the mean ± SD.

Twenty-nine patients (49%; 95% exact confidence interval [CI], 37%-62%) patients achieved a CR/CRi after one or two cycles of induction, with a measurable residual disease negativity rate of 67% as assessed by centralized, multiparameter flow cytometry. Among patients who had serial next-generation sequencing analyses available, clearance of somatic mutations that were present at diagnosis was achieved in 7 (35%). The median follow-up among survivors was 16.8 months (range, 8.7-24.3 months). The median event-free survival was 3.0 months (95% CI, 1.4-7.3 months), and the median overall survival was 7.4 months (95% CI, 3.7-12.7 months). In landmark analyses at day +100 from diagnosis, the 1-year overall and event-free survival rate among patients who underwent allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation was 70% (95% CI, 47%-100%) and 70% (95% CI, 47%-100%), respectively. The corresponding values were 89% (95% CI, 71%-100%) and 44% (95% CI, 21%-92%), respectively, for patients who entered the maintenance phase. No significant longitudinal changes were observed in severity index or quality-of-life visual analog scale scores. The current data provide novel insights that might inform the clinical positioning and optimal use of CPX-351, complementing previous results (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT04230239).",Ballesteros J; ,; Vivia Biotech,

Nonetheless, how prenatal exposure to metals eventually results in long-term effects on the gut microbiome, leading to subclinical intestinal inflammation, particularly during late childhood, has not been studied. It is also unknown whether such an interactive effect drives a specific subgroup of children toward elevated susceptibility to intestinal inflammation. We used an amalgamation of machine-learning techniques with a regression-based framework to explore if children with distinct sets of gut microbes and certain patterns of exposure to metals during pregnancy (metal-microbial clique signature) had a higher likelihood of intestinal inflammation, measured based on fecal calprotectin (FC) in late childhood.

Since natural infections do not induce persistent immunity, there is the need of vaccines providing long-term protection. Here, we evaluated a new adenoviral vector (rAd) vaccine based on the rare serotype rAd19a and compared the immunogenicity and efficacy to the highly immunogenic rAd5. Given as an intranasal boost in DNA primed mice, both vectors encoding the F protein provided efficient protection against a subsequent RSV infection. However, intramuscular immunization with rAd19a vectors provoked vaccine-enhanced disease after RSV infection compared to non-vaccinated animals. While mucosal IgA antibodies and tissue-resident memory T-cells in intranasally vaccinated mice rapidly control RSV replication, a strong anamnestic systemic T-cell response in absence of local immunity might be the reason for immune-mediated enhanced disease. Our study highlighted the potential benefits of developing effective mucosal against respiratory pathogens.",Thirion C,Sirion Biotech,matthias.tenbusch@fau.de.

Several prognostic markers have been associated with CAR T-cell outcomes, such as tumor burden, response to bridging chemotherapy, and laboratory parameters at the time of lymphodepletion or infusion. The effect of cancer cachexia and weight loss before CAR T cells on toxicity and outcomes is not well understood. Here, we present a retrospective single-institution cohort study of 259 patients with lymphoma treated with CAR T cells between 2017 and 2023. We observed that patients with >5% decrease in their body mass index in the 3 months preceding CAR T-cell treatment (weight loss group; all meeting one of the commonly accepted definitions of cancer cachexia) had higher disease burden and inflammatory parameters (C-reactive protein, ferritin, interleukin-6, and tumor necrosis factor α) at the time of lymphodepletion and CAR T-cell infusion. Patients with weight loss experienced higher rates of grade 3+ neurotoxicity and early hematotoxicity, but those effects were not seen upon multivariable adjustment. However, in both univariate and multivariable analysis, patients with weight loss had worse response rates, overall survival, and event-free survival, indicating that weight loss is an independent poor prognostic factor. Our data suggest that weight loss in the 3 months preceding CAR T-cell therapy represents a worrisome ""alarm signal"" and a potentially modifiable factor, alongside tumor burden and inflammation, and warrants further investigation in patients treated with CAR T-cell therapy.",,,

Participants with neuropathic pain were cases and compared with those exposed to injury or disease but without neuropathic pain as control subjects. Diabetic polyneuropathy was the most common aetiology of neuropathic pain. A standardised quantitative sensory testing protocol was used to categorize participants based on sensory profile. We performed genome-wide association study, and in a subset of participants, we undertook whole-exome sequencing targeting analyses of 45 known pain-related genes. In the genome-wide association study of diabetic neuropathy (N = 1541), a top significant association was found at the KCNT2 locus linked with pain intensity (rs114159097, P = 3.55 × 10 -8 ). Gene-based analysis revealed significant associations between LHX8 and TCF7L2 and neuropathic pain. Polygenic risk score for depression was associated with neuropathic pain in all participants. Polygenic risk score for C-reactive protein showed a positive association, while that for fasting insulin showed a negative association with neuropathic pain, in individuals with diabetic polyneuropathy. Gene burden analysis of candidate pain genes supported significant associations between rare variants in SCN9A and OPRM1 and neuropathic pain.

Effective vaccines that provide robust protection, elicit strong immune responses, exhibit favorable safety profiles, and enable cost-effective large-scale production are crucial. The RBD-Fc-based Betuvax-CoV-2 vaccine has previously demonstrated a favorable safety profile and induced a significant anti-SARS-CoV-2 humoral immune response in clinical trials. Due to the rapid evolution and emergence of new SARS-CoV-2 strains, the relevance of bivalent vaccine formulations has increased. This study compared the neutralizing capacity of monovalent and bivalent vaccine formulations against different SARS-CoV-2 strains detected with a SARS-CoV-2 microneutralization assay (MNT). The monovalent Wuhan-based vaccine generated neutralizing antibodies against the Wuhan and Omicron BA.2 variants but not the distinct Omicron BQ.1 strain. Conversely, the monovalent BA.2-based vaccine induced neutralizing antibodies against both Omicron strains but not Wuhan. While the bivalent Wuhan and BA.2-based vaccine was effective against strains containing the same antigens, it was insufficient to neutralize the distinctive BQ.1 strain at a small dosage. These findings suggest that the vaccine composition should closely match the circulating SARS-CoV-2 strain to elicit the optimal neutralizing antibody response and include the appropriate dosage. Moreover, this study did not find additional advantages of using the bivalent form over the monovalent form for the vaccination against a single prevailing SARS-CoV-2 strain.",Vakhrusheva AV; Sukhova MM; Kuznetsova KS; Frolova ME; Ivanishin TV; Krasilnikov IV; Isaev AA,Artgen Biotech; Biotechnology Developments; Betuvax,

Identification of patient populations and factors associated with long-term treatment response trajectories may improve UC management. We aimed to identify and describe distinct patient subgroups of response to filgotinib based on partial Mayo Clinic Score (pMCS) trajectories over time. In these post hoc analyses of SELECTION, group-based trajectory modeling (GBTM) was applied to pMCS to describe groups of distinct, symptom-based patient trajectories using data from patients who responded to filgotinib 200 or 100 mg and continued receiving filgotinib up to week 58. Patient demographics, disease characteristics, and week 10 response were compared between the groups. Achievement of a patient-level multi-component endpoint of comprehensive disease control (CDC) was assessed in each group. GBTM identified five distinct patient populations with different response trajectories; 67.5% of patients had beneficial trajectories. The beneficial trajectory groups generally had higher proportions of patients who were recently diagnosed (<1 year), were receiving filgotinib 200 mg and were biologic-naive versus the relapsing trajectory groups (4%-9% vs. 4%-5%; 43%-65% vs. 36%-46%; 54%-70% vs. 35%-58%, respectively). Furthermore, 55.4% of patients had sustained beneficial trajectories, with low baseline endoscopic subscores (≥43% of patients had a subscore of 2) and strong week 10 FCP responses (≥61% of patients with >50% decrease in FCP from baseline). Sustained beneficial trajectory groups had a higher probability of achieving CDC at week 58 than other groups (31%-32% vs. 0%-7%).

We found that this SNP contributes to aggravated inflammatory response in COVID-19 patients resulting from biased macrophage activation. R72-P53 inhibits mitochondrial manganese superoxide dismutase, leading to impaired reactive oxygen species scavenging, oxidation of phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN), and, consequently, its inhibition. Reduced PTEN activity causes constitutive activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway, which restricts proinflammatory (M1) and promotes anti-inflammatory (M2) phenotypes through NF-κB and p53 inhibition. In contrast, PTEN-reduced PI3K/Akt activity, in P72 carrying cells, favors M1 phenotypes. LPS-stimulated R72 macrophages fail to reduce tumor growth in a mouse model of cancer, in contrast with P72 macrophages, which preserve M1 phenotype in vivo and reduce tumor growth by enhancing antitumor T cell responses, consistent with antitumor functions of M1 macrophages. In addition, P72 macrophages contributed to increased mortality in a mouse model of LPS-induced endotoxemia. Therefore, given the high frequency of P72 in African Americans, cell signaling alterations driven by codon 72 of TP53 SNP may potentially contribute to differences in clinical outcomes and health disparities in common diseases associated with dysregulated macrophage activation.",Li Y; Kolev MV,Research; Discovery,

In this study, xenograft model mice with tumors expressing different levels of the trophoblast antigen 2 (TROP2) were generated by subcutaneously transplanting the various TROP2-expressing cancer lines. The mice received different doses of TROP2-eribulin, a novel TROP2-targeting ADC, composed of an anti-TROP2 antibody and the eribulin payload, joined by a cleavable linker. The concentration and distribution of TROP2-eribulin, as well as the pharmacokinetics of eribulin release, were assessed in tumor and lung tissues. Analysis of tumor tissue showed that the concentration of released eribulin was approximately 10-fold higher in NCI-H2110 (high TROP2 expression) than in A549 (low TROP2 expression), whereas analysis of lung tissue showed that TROP2-eribulin was distributed in lung tissue in a dose-dependent manner, regardless of TROP2 expression, with significantly more eribulin released in the high-dose group than in the other dose groups (P < 0.05). Immunofluorescence assay analysis showed that TROP2-eribulin localized to alveolar macrophages. In the analysis using human leukemia monocytic cell, the concentration of eribulin released from TROP2-eribulin was significantly reduced by the use of an Fc receptor inhibitor (P < 0.05).

Here, we describe an optimized partial freezing protocol with key optimizations, including an increased concentration of polyethylene glycol (PEG) to enhance membrane stability while minimizing shear stress during cryoprotectant unloading with an acclimation period and a maintained osmotic balance through an increase in bovine serum albumin (BSA). These approaches ensured the viability during preservation and recovery processes, promoting liver function and ensuring optimal preservation. This was evidenced by increased oxygen consumption, decreased vascular resistance, and edema. Ultimately, we show that using the optimized protocol, livers can be stored for 10 days with comparable vascular resistance and lactate levels to 5 days, outperforming the viability of time-matched static cold stored (SCS) livers as the current gold standard. This study represents a significant advancement in expanding organ availability through prolonged preservation, thereby revolutionizing transplant medicine.",,,SNTESSIER@mgh.harvard.edu.

A typical TCS consists of a histidine kinase (HK) that activates a response regulator via phosphorylation in response to environmental signals. Here, we systematically test the effect of inactivating the conserved phosphatase activity of HKs to activate TCS signaling pathways. Transcriptome analyses of 14 HK mutants in Streptococcus agalactiae, the leading cause of neonatal meningitis, validate the conserved HK phosphatase mechanism and its role in the inhibition of TCS activity in vivo. Constitutive TCS activation, independent of environmental signals, enables high-resolution mapping of the regulons for several TCSs (e.g., SaeRS, BceRS, VncRS, DltRS, HK11030, HK02290) and reveals the functional diversity of TCS signaling pathways, ranging from highly specialized to interconnected global regulatory networks. Targeted analysis shows that the SaeRS-regulated PbsP adhesin acts as a signaling molecule to activate CovRS signaling, thereby linking the major regulators of host-pathogen interactions. Furthermore, constitutive BceRS activation reveals drug-independent activity, suggesting a role in cell envelope homeostasis beyond antimicrobial resistance. This study highlights the versatility of constitutive TCS activation, via phosphatase-deficient HKs, to uncover regulatory networks and biological processes.",Claverie C; Coppolino F; Mazzuoli MV; Jacquemet E; Legendre R; Sismeiro O; Teti G; Trieu-Cuot P; Firon A,Scylla Biotech Srl; Institut Pasteur,arnaud.firon@pasteur.fr.

Addressing these escape mechanisms requires targeting evolutionarily conserved vulnerabilities, as mutations in these regions often impose fitness costs. We introduce adaptive multi-epitope targeting with enhanced avidity (AMETA), a modular and multivalent nanobody platform that conjugates potent bispecific nanobodies to a human immunoglobulin M (IgM) scaffold. AMETA can display 20+ nanobodies, enabling superior avidity binding to multiple conserved and neutralizing epitopes. By leveraging multi-epitope SARS-CoV-2 nanobodies and structure-guided design, AMETA constructs exponentially enhance antiviral potency, surpassing monomeric nanobodies by over a million-fold. These constructs demonstrate ultrapotent, broad, and durable efficacy against pathogenic sarbecoviruses, including Omicron sublineages, with robust preclinical results. Structural analysis through cryoelectron microscopy and modeling has uncovered multiple antiviral mechanisms within a single construct. At picomolar to nanomolar concentrations, AMETA efficiently induces inter-spike and inter-virus cross-linking, promoting spike post-fusion and striking viral disarmament. AMETA's modularity enables rapid, cost-effective production and adaptation to evolving pathogens.",,,kris.white@mssm.edu.

Recently, it has been demonstrated that an electro-osmotic flow can be used to induce the transport of unraveled polypeptides across nanopores. Polypeptide translocation, however, is too fast for accurate reading its amino acid compositions. Here, we show that the introduction of hydrophobic residues into the lumen of the nanopore reduces the protein translocation speed. Importantly, the introduction of a tyrosine at the entry of the nanopore and an isoleucine at the entry of the β-barrel of the nanopore reduced the speed of translocation to ∼10 amino acids/millisecond while keeping a relatively large ionic current, a crucial component for protein identification. These nanopores showed unique features within their current signatures, which may pave the way toward protein fingerprinting using nanopores.",,,

Underuse may be partially a result of misconceptions held by some healthcare professionals (HCPs) pertaining to LAIs. A panel of four experts convened between January 2022 and May 2022 to identify these misconceptions, and example cases or scenarios were created to illustrate common clinical situations relevant to these beliefs. Ultimately, an online platform and heuristic tool, Schizophrenia Clinical Outcome Scenarios and Patient-Provider Engagement (S.C.O.P.E.™), was developed to help prescribing clinicians and other HCPs better understand common clinical dilemmas, as well as the place for LAIs in schizophrenia treatment. Three main misconceptions related to the use of LAIs to treat schizophrenia were identified and included ""physicians/providers know when patients are nonadherent"", ""patients do not accept/want LAI treatment"", and ""LAIs are only appropriate for patients who have demonstrated nonadherence"". All misconceptions are refuted by current evidence and were used to develop clinical scenarios with questions to consider when patients present to various sites of care for treatment. These cases are presented on the S.C.O.P.E. educational platform. The platform also includes videos designed to help non-prescribing HCPs and mental health professionals address patient/caregiver concerns and to communicate LAI benefits. In addition, S.C.O.P.E. provides a section with information about each LAI that is currently FDA approved in the United States for the treatment of schizophrenia, to help familiarize HCPs with characteristics of LAIs. S.C.O.P.E. is an educational tool designed for HCPs to help improve their understanding of how to manage common clinical dilemmas in the treatment of people with schizophrenia, to clarify the role of LAIs in medication management, and to increase understanding of the characteristics of available LAIs. S.C.O.P.E. also aims to improve care in schizophrenia by facilitating increased awareness to patients and caregivers. Schizophrenia is a serious, lifelong mental health disorder that affects about 2.8 million adults in the United States and many more worldwide. Symptoms can include hallucinations (ie, hearing “voices”), delusions (ie, convinced something is true when it is not), poor attention, lack of motivation and interest, and cognitive problems. Schizophrenia can have considerable impact on people with the disorder as well as their families, friends, and communities. There are several treatment options available for healthcare professionals (HCPs), patients, and caregivers to consider, with antipsychotic medicines being the cornerstone of the treatment for schizophrenia. Long-acting injectable antipsychotics (LAIs) have shown benefits over antipsychotics taken orally (by mouth), but are underused, and this is likely due to some common misconceptions. Four experts in schizophrenia treatment met repeatedly online to identify some of these misconceptions and created a tool to help HCPs learn about misconceptions, using example cases of patients with schizophrenia who have different types of clinical situations and concerns. On the Schizophrenia Clinical Outcome Scenarios and Patient-Provider Engagement (S.C.O.P.E.™) interactive digital platform, HCPs can choose in which type of case they are interested in and see details of the case, information they should obtain about the case, and appropriate considerations for LAI use. The tool also provides videos about communicating with patients and their families about LAIs, and information about the different LAIs currently available. The goal of providing this tool to HCPs is to improve understanding of how to treat patients with schizophrenia and the role that LAIs can play.",Mychaskiw MA; Thompson S; Franzenburg KR; Suett M; Kotak S,Global Health Economics and Outcomes Research; Yorker Health Corp.; Global Medical Affairs,

This was a first-in-human phase I study of BAY 2666605 (NCT04809805), an oral, potent first-in-class PDE3A-SLFN12 complex inducer, with reduced PDE3A inhibition. Adults with advanced solid tumors that coexpress SLFN12 and PDE3A received BAY 2666605 at escalating doses starting at 5 mg once daily in 28-day cycles. Forty-seven patients were prescreened for SLFN12 and PDE3A overexpression, and five biomarker-positive patients received ≥1 BAY 2666605 dose. The most common adverse event was grade 3 to 4 thrombocytopenia in three of the five patients treated. The long half-life (>360 hours) and associated accumulation of BAY 2666605 led to the selection of an alternative schedule consisting of a loading dose with a once-daily maintenance dose. The maximum tolerated dose was not established as the highest doses of both schedules were intolerable. No objective responses were observed. Due to the high expression of PDE3A in platelets compared with tumor tissues, the ex vivo dose-dependent inhibitory effect of BAY 2666605 on megakaryocytes, and the pharmacokinetic profile of the compound, alternative schedules were not predicted to ameliorate the mechanism-based thrombocytopenia.

The limited number of available models to study malignant bladder tumors is one of the obstructions in developing bladder cancer therapeutics. Patient-derived xenograft (PDX) and organoid (PDO) models are more representatives of human cancer than cell lines and cell line-derived xenograft (CDX) and are likely to be more promising and efficient in predicting drug response and finding new therapeutics. Three pairs of patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models of bladder cancer and their corresponding PDX-derived organoids (PDXOs) were successfully established. These models were utilized to assess the efficacy of abemaciclib. The sensitivity of the drug was determined through the Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK8) assay in PDXO cultures, corroborated by the EdU incorporation assay. Additionally, the in vivo tumor growth was monitored in the matched PDX models. In vitro PDXO cultures and in vivo PDX tumor models consistently demonstrated that abemaciclib had varying degrees of inhibitory effects across different bladder cancer (BC) patients. Notably, our study further revealed that treatment with abemaciclib significantly modified the expression patterns of CyclinD1/CDK4. This was achieved by not only diminishing their expression levels but also by shifting their expression from a membrane-associated localization to the nucleus. Our research provided compelling evidence attesting to the reliability and potential of PDX and PDXO models in the realm of precision medicine.

The mechanisms underlying these events and how they are connected to known risk factors for poor outcome, like obesity and diabetes, is relatively unknown. Herein we demonstrate that increased adipose tissue lipolysis is a dominating risk factor for the development of a compromised cerebrovasculature in ischemic stroke. Reducing adipose lipolysis by VEGF-B antagonism improved vascular integrity by reducing ectopic cerebrovascular lipid deposition. Thrombolytic therapy in ischemic stroke using tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) leads to increased risk of hemorrhagic complications, substantially limiting the use of thrombolytic therapy. We provide evidence that thrombolysis with tPA promotes adipose tissue lipolysis, leading to a rise in plasma fatty acids and lipid accumulation in the ischemic cerebrovasculature after stroke. VEGF-B blockade improved the efficacy and safety of thrombolysis suggesting the potential use of anti-VEGF-B therapy to extend the therapeutic window for stroke management.",Scotney PD,CSL Innovation Pty Ltd,
39415995,miR126-mediated impaired vascular integrity in Rett syndrome.,,bioRxiv : the preprint server for biology,10.1101/2024.10.11.617929,"Rett syndrome (RTT) is a neurodevelopmental disorder that is caused by mutations in melty-CpG binding protein 2 (MeCP2). MeCP2 is a non-cell type-specific DNA binding protein, and its mutation influences not only neural cells but also non-neural cells in the brain, including vasculature associated with endothelial cells. Vascular integrity is crucial for maintaining brain homeostasis, and its alteration may be linked to the pathology of neurodegenerative disease, but a non-neurogenic effect, especially the relationship between vascular alternation and Rett syndrome pathogenesis, has not been shown. Here, we recapitulate a microvascular network using Rett syndrome patient-derived induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells that carry MeCP2[R306C] mutation to investigate early developmental vascular impact. To expedite endothelial cell differentiation, doxycycline (DOX)-inducible ETV2 expression vectors were inserted into the AAVS1 locus of Rett syndrome patient-derived iPS cells and its isogenic control by CRISPR/Cas9. With these endothelial cells, we established a disease microvascular network (Rett-dMVNs) and observed higher permeability in the Rett-dMVNs compared to isogenic controls, indicating altered barrier function by MeCP2 mutation. Furthermore, we unveiled that hyperpermeability is involved in the upregulation of miR126-3p in Rett syndrome patient-derived endothelial cells by microRNA profiling and RNAseq, and rescue of miR126-3p level can recover their phenotype. We discover miR126-3p-mediated vascular impairment in Rett syndrome patients and suggest the potential application of these findings for translational medicine.",,,

Their role as signal transducers is critical to light perception across the animal kingdom. Opsins covalently bind to the chromophore 11-cis retinal, which isomerizes to the all-trans isomer upon photon absorption, causing conformational changes that result in receptor activation. Monostable opsins, responsible for vision in vertebrates, release the chromophore after activation and must bind another retinal molecule to remain functional. In contrast, bistable opsins, responsible for non-visual light perception in vertebrates and for vision in invertebrates, absorb a second photon in the active state to return the chromophore and protein to the inactive state. Structures of bistable opsins in the activated state have proven elusive, limiting our understanding of how they function as bidirectional photoswitches. Here we present active state structures of a bistable opsin, jumping spider rhodopsin isoform-1 (JSR1), in complex with its downstream signaling partners, the G",Afanasyev P,Cryo-EM Knowledge Hub,gebhard.schertler@psi.ch.

Patients developed acute-onset symptoms (typically non-bloody Grade 3+ diarrhea) with negative infectious workup beginning a median of 92.5 days (range: 22-210 days) after CAR-T therapy and a median of 85 days after cytokine release syndrome resolution. Gut biopsies uniformly demonstrated inflammation, including intra-epithelial lymphocytosis and villous blunting. In one case where CAR-specific immunofluorescence stains were available, CAR T-cell presence was confirmed within the lamina propria. Systemic corticosteroids were initiated in 10 patients (71%) a median of 25.5 days following symptom onset, with symptom improvement in 40%. Subsequent infliximab or vedolizumab led to improvement in 50% and 33% of corticosteroid-refractory patients, respectively. Five patients (36%) have died from bowel perforation or treatment-emergent sepsis. In conclusion, IEC-associated enterocolitis is a distinct but rare complication of CAR-T therapy typically beginning 1-3 months after infusion. Thorough diagnostic workup is essential, including evaluation for potential T-cell malignancies.

NG-350A is a next-generation blood-stable adenoviral vector engineered to express an agonist anti-cluster of differentiation (CD)40 antibody without affecting tumor-selectivity and oncolytic potency. Intravenous and intratumoral (IT) administration of NG-350A was assessed in a phase Ia/Ib study in patients with metastatic/advanced epithelial tumors (NCT03852511). Dose-escalation was performed separately for intravenous (four dose levels available, each with infusions on Days 1, 3 and 5 of a 57-day treatment period) and IT (single injection on D1 only or injections on Days 1, 8, 15 and 22) administration. The primary objective was safety and tolerability; secondary objectives included determining a recommended dose, pharmacokinetics, and immunogenicity. In total, 25 heavily pretreated patients received NG-350A (16 with intravenous and 9 with IT administration). Intravenous and IT dosing were both well tolerated, with no evidence of transgene-related or off-target viral toxicity. Intravenous and IT dosing resulted in dose-dependent increases in systemic NG-350A C This phase 1a study provided initial proof-of-mechanism for NG-350A, with strong evidence of tumor delivery, viral replication and transgene expression-particularly after intravenous dosing. The lack of transgene-related or off-target viral toxicity was consistent with the highly selective delivery and replication of NG-350A, even after systemic delivery.

Thus, academic and scientific communities now view global food security as a critical issue. However, food loss and waste are a major challenge when adopting food security and sustainability strategies, since a large proportion of food is lost or wasted along the food supply chain. In order to use resources efficiently and enhance food security and sustainability, food waste and by-products must be reduced and properly valorized. Plant-based food production generates various by-products which are generally rich in nutrients and bioactive compounds. Emerging technologies have been effectively employed to extract these valuable compounds with health benefits. Recently, Industry 4.0 technologies such as artificial intelligence, the Internet of Things, blockchain, robotics, smart sensors, 3D printing, and digital twins have a great deal of potential for waste reduction and by-products valorization in food industry. Reducing food waste not only benefits the environment, but also reduces greenhouse gas emissions and thus contributes to sustainable resource management. This review provides up-to-date information on the potential of Industry 4.0 for converting plant-based waste and by-products into valuable products. Recent studies showed that innovations in Industry 4.0 provide attractive opportunities to increase the effectiveness of manufacturing operations and improve food quality, safety and traceability.

The outcomes include different nervous system manifestations as well as multiple organ damage. Despite the availability of known biomarkers, early detection of FD remains a medical need. This study aimed to develop an in silico model based on machine learning to identify candidate vascular and nervous system proteins for early FD damage detection at the cellular level. A combined systems biology and machine learning approach was carried out considering molecular characteristics of FD to create a computational model of vascular and nervous system disease. A data science strategy was applied to identify risk classifiers by using 10 K-fold cross-validation. Further biological and clinical criteria were used to prioritize the most promising candidates, resulting in the identification of 36 biomarker candidates with classifier abilities, which are easily measurable in body fluids. Among them, we propose four candidates, CAMK2A, ILK, LMNA, and KHSRP, which have high classification capabilities according to our models (cross-validated accuracy ≥ 90%) and are related to the vascular and nervous systems.

These products are processed using techniques that often lead to low purity but competitive pricing. Despite their widespread use and well-established production methods, the industry lacks standardized analytical methods for assessing these products and detecting potential fraud. This study proposes a comprehensive and harmonized pipeline for their analysis, which includes quantifying total soluble protein and proteolytic activity, as well as the determination of product stability and protein profile using SDS-PAGE and proteomic techniques. Despite the fact that protease extracts from pineapple had the highest protein content, most of the bromelain remained inactive, unlike in kiwi and papaya. SDS-PAGE revealed partial protein degradation of pineapple extracts, whereas kiwi extracts reflected a lower purification level but a higher protein integrity. The application of proteomic approaches strengthened the identification and origin tracing of the proteases. This study contributes to the development of a robust framework for analyzing proteolytic extracts, spanning from soluble protein quantification to protein profiling and activity determination.

This therapy focuses on the regulation of the membrane's structure and organization with the consequent modulation of certain cell signals to revert the pathological state in several disorders. Notch signaling has been associated with tumorigenesis and cell survival, potentially driving the pathogenesis of GBM. The current study aims to determine whether 2OHOA modulates the Notch pathway as part of its antitumoral mechanism. 2OHOA's effect was evaluated on different components of the pathway by Western blot, Q-PCR, and confocal microscopy. Notch receptor processing was analyzed by subcellular fractionation and colocalization studies. Furin activity was evaluated under cleavage of its substrate by fluorescence assays and its binding affinity to 2OHOA was determined by surface plasmon resonance. We found that 2OHOA inhibits Notch2 and Notch3 signaling by dual mechanism. Notch2 inhibition is unleashed by impairment of its processing through the inactivation of furin activity by physical association. Instead, Notch3 is transcriptionally downregulated leading to a lower activation of the pathway. Moreover, we also found that HES1 overexpression highlighted the relevance of this pathway in the 2OHOA pharmacological efficacy. These findings report that the inhibition of Notch signaling by 2OHOA plays a role in its anti-tumoral activity, an effect that may be driven through direct inhibition of furin, characterizing a novel target of this bioactive lipid to treat GBM.",Fernández-García P,R&D Department,raquel.rodriguez@uib.es.

In some individuals, clinically used polymyxins can cause acute hypersensitivity reactions through mast cell activation, with a recent study attributing this effect to activation of the MAS-related G protein-coupled receptor X2 (MRGPRX2). In the present study, HEK293 cells expressing human MRGPRX2 and the human mast cell line LAD2 were used to characterize the activity of the broader family of polymyxins. Octapeptin C4, polymyxin B and colistin produced concentration-dependent calcium mobilization, degranulation, and CCL-2 (MCP-1) release in LAD2 mast cells, with the former being highly potent. CRISPR-Cas9 knockdown of MRGPRX2 in LAD2 cells and a MRGPRX2 inverse agonist caused a significant reduction in calcium mobilization, degranulation, and CCL-2 release, demonstrating dependency on MRGPRX2 expression. In contrast, polymyxin nonapeptides were far less potent calcium mobilisers and failed to induce functional degranulation in LAD2 cells. Our results confirm that activation of mast cells induced by polymyxin-related antibiotics is MRGPRX2-dependent and reveal that octapeptin C4 might be more liable, whilst nonapeptides are less liable, to trigger immediate hypersensitivity reactions clinically. The mechanism underpinning the difference in MRGPRX2 activation between polymyxin-related antibiotics is important to better understand as it may help design new, safer polymyxins and guide the optimal clinical use of existing polymyxin drugs.",,,gmackay@unimelb.edu.au.

Median Pig-MAP concentration in saliva from healthy animals was 19 ng/mL whereas in pigs with different inflammatory conditions was 11 times higher. In the same animals median pig-MAP serum concentrations were 0.72 mg/mL in the healthy group and 4.61 in the diseased group. The Spearman coefficient of correlation between Pig-MAP concentration in serum and saliva was of 0.72. A correlation was also observed between the salivary concentration of pig-MAP and other two acute phase proteins such as haptoglobin (r = 0.62) or C-reactive protein (r = 0.65). The concentration of Pig-MAP in saliva of pigs with severe respiratory disease decreased significantly from a median value of 128 ng/mL at the time of disease detection to 8 ng/mL after 1 day of antibiotic therapy. Studies performed show that pig-MAP is present in saliva and this specimen may be an alternative to serum for pig-MAP quantification.",Piñeiro M; Miralles A,Cefu S.A.; Acuvet Biotech,agmontes@um.es.

KS research is hindered by rapid loss of KSHV infection upon explant culture of tumor cells. Here, we establish patient-derived KS xenografts (PDXs) upon orthotopic implantation of cutaneous KS biopsies in immunodeficient mice. KS tumors were maintained in 27/28 PDX until experimental endpoint, up to 272 days in the first passage of recipient mice. KSHV latency associated nuclear antigen (LANA)+ endothelial cell density increased by a mean 4.3-fold in 14/15 PDX analyzed by IHC at passage 1 compared to respective input biopsies, regardless of implantation variables and clinical features of patients. The Ki-67 proliferation marker colocalized with LANA more frequently in PDXs. Spatial transcriptome analysis revealed increased expression of viral transcripts from latent and lytic gene classes in the PDX. The expanded KSHV+ regions of the PDX maintained signature gene expression of KS tumors, with enrichment in pathways associated with angiogenesis and endothelium development.

Nadunolimab is an IL1 receptor accessory protein (IL1RAP)-targeting antibody with enhanced antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity that blocks IL1α/IL1β signaling. We investigated efficacy and safety of nadunolimab in PDAC, in combination with gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel (GN). Patients with previously untreated locally advanced/metastatic PDAC received nadunolimab (1.0-7.5 mg/kg) every 2 weeks with standard GN. The primary objective was safety; secondary objectives were antitumor response, progression-free survival, and overall survival (OS). Correlations between serum and tumor biomarkers and clinical response were explored. Seventy-six patients were enrolled; the median age was 63 years (range, 43-89), 42% were female, 97% had metastatic disease, and 9% had received adjuvant chemotherapy. The most frequent grade ≥3 adverse event was neutropenia (66%), typically during cycle 1. Infusion-related reactions occurred in 29% (grade 3, 3%). Only 1 of the 76 patients had grade 3 or above peripheral neuropathy. No marked dose-dependent differences in safety or efficacy were observed among the four dose groups. The median OS was 13.2 months (95% confidence interval, 11.0-15.6), and the 1-year survival rate was 58%. The median immune PFS (immune Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours) was 7.1 months (95% confidence interval, 5.2-7.4). Treatment efficacy was higher in patients with high versus low tumor baseline IL1RAP expression (OS 14.2 vs. 10.6 months; P = 0.012). A reduction in serum IL8 on treatment correlated with prolonged OS. Nadunolimab combined with GN shows promising efficacy and manageable safety in locally advanced/metastatic PDAC.

Most patients present with early-stage disease, but a substantial proportion progress to myelofibrosis or secondary leukemia, advanced cancers with a poor prognosis and high symptom burden. Currently, it remains difficult to predict progression, and therapies that reliably prevent or reverse fibrosis are lacking. A major bottleneck to the discovery of disease-modifying therapies has been an incomplete understanding of the interplay between perturbed cellular and molecular states. Several cell types have individually been implicated, but a comprehensive analysis of myelofibrotic bone marrow is lacking. We therefore mapped the cross-talk between bone marrow cell types in myelofibrotic bone marrow. We found that inflammation and fibrosis are orchestrated by a ""quartet"" of immune and stromal cell lineages, with basophils and mast cells creating a TNF signaling hub, communicating with megakaryocytes, mesenchymal stromal cells, and proinflammatory fibroblasts. We identified the β-galactoside-binding protein galectin-1 as a biomarker of progression to myelofibrosis and poor survival in multiple patient cohorts and as a promising therapeutic target, with reduced myeloproliferation and fibrosis in vitro and in vivo and improved survival after galectin-1 inhibition. In human bone marrow organoids, TNF increased galectin-1 expression, suggesting a feedback loop wherein the proinflammatory myeloproliferative neoplasm clone creates a self-reinforcing niche, fueling progression to advanced disease. This study provides a resource for studying hematopoietic cell-niche interactions, with relevance for cancer-associated inflammation and disorders of tissue fibrosis.",Pérez Sáez JM; Rabinovich GA,Laboratorio de Glicomedicina,

We sought to understand factors associated with P/LP germline variants in patients with metastatic or localized prostate cancer qualifying for National Comprehensive Cancer Network genetic testing criteria. Patients diagnosed with prostate cancer were offered genetic testing in accordance with National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines. Patient-level factors, including demographic, clinical, and pathologic data, were tracked in a prospectively collected registry.

Senescence evolves in part due to antagonistic pleiotropy (AP), where selection favors gene variants that increase fitness earlier in life but promote pathology later. Identifying the biological mechanisms by which AP causes senescence is key to understanding the endogenous causes of aging and its attendant diseases. Here we argue that the frequent occurrence of AP as a property of genes reflects the presence of constraint in the biological systems that they specify. This arises particularly because the functionally interconnected nature of biological systems constrains the simultaneous optimization of coupled traits (interconnection constraints), or because individual traits cannot evolve (impossibility constraints). We present an account of aging that integrates AP and biological constraint with recent programmatic aging concepts, including costly programs, quasi-programs, hyperfunction and hypofunction. We argue that AP mechanisms of costly programs and triggered quasi-programs are consequences of constraint, in which costs resulting from hyperfunction or hypofunction cause senescent pathology. Impossibility constraint can also cause hypofunction independently of AP. We also describe how AP corresponds to Stephen Jay Gould's constraint-based concept of evolutionary spandrels, and argue that pathologies arising from AP are bad spandrels. Biological constraint is a conceptual missing link between ultimate and proximate causes of senescence, including diseases of aging.",,,david.gems@ucl.ac.uk.

Resistance to BCMA-targeting therapies, nonetheless, remains a significant challenge. BCMA shedding by γ-secretase is a known resistance mechanism, and preclinical studies suggest that inhibition may improve anti-BCMA therapy. Leveraging a phase 1 clinical trial of the γ-secretase inhibitor (GSI), crenigacestat, with anti-BCMA CAR T cells (FCARH143), we used single-nuclei RNA sequencing and assay for transposase-accessible chromatin sequencing to characterize the effects of GSI on the tumor microenvironment. The most significant impacts of GSI involved effects on monocytes, which are known to promote tumor growth. In addition to observing a reduction in the frequency of nonclassical monocytes, we also detected significant changes in gene expression, chromatin accessibility, and inferred cell-cell interactions after exposure to GSI. Although many genes with altered expression are associated with γ-secretase-dependent signaling, such as Notch, other pathways were affected, indicating GSI has far-reaching effects. Finally, we detected monoallelic deletion of the BCMA locus in some patients with prior exposure to anti-BCMA therapy, which significantly correlated with reduced progression-free survival (PFS; median PFS, 57 vs 861 days). GSIs are being explored in combination with the full spectrum of BCMA-targeting agents, and our results reveal widespread effects of GSI on both tumor and immune cell populations, providing insight into mechanisms for enhancing BCMA-directed therapies.",,,

Agricultural film is commonly employed to enhance the yield of peanuts; its use may lead to excessive dibutyl phthalate (DBP) residues in peanut kernels. But, limited investigations have been conducted on the regulatory mechanism of peanut leaves in response to DBP exposure throughout the entire growth period. To bridge this knowledge gap, we investigated the differences in transcriptome and metabolome of peanut leaves under DBP stress. According to visual observations, the results of morphological response showed that the growth of peanut plants was significantly inhibited from seedling to pod stage under DBP treatment. Transcriptomic analysis results showed that the genes AH19G05510 (LRR receptor-like serine threonine-protein kinase) and AH20G31870 (disease resistance), belonging to the FAR1 family and bZIP family respectively, may be key genes involved in the resistance to DBP stress throughout its growth stages. Metabolomic analysis results showed that during the initial stage of DBP stress, the key metabolites in peanut leaves response to stress were carboxylic acids and derivatives, as well as fatty acyls. As peanut growth progressed, flavonoids gradually became more prominent in the resistance to DBP stress. By integrating metabolomics and transcriptomics analysis, we have identified that purine metabolism during seedling and flowering stages, as well as the flavone and flavonol biosynthesis pathways during pod and maturity stages, played a crucial role in response to DBP stress. These findings not only provide valuable key gene and metabolic information for studying anti-plasticizer pollution throughout the entire growth period of peanuts, but also offer reference for enhancing crop resistance to plasticizer pollution through genetic modification and metabolic regulation.",Quan S,Shandong Baolai-leelai Bio-tech.

During this time, over 350,000 new chemical substances have been introduced to the lives of humans. In recent years, the epithelial barrier theory came to light explaining the growing prevalence and exacerbations of these diseases worldwide. It attributes their onset to a functionally impaired epithelial barrier triggered by the toxicity of the exposed substances, associated with microbial dysbiosis, immune system activation, and inflammation. Diseases encompassed by the epithelial barrier theory share common features such as an increased prevalence after the 1960s or 2000s that cannot (solely) be accounted for by the emergence of improved diagnostic methods. Other common traits include epithelial barrier defects, microbial dysbiosis with loss of commensals and colonization of opportunistic pathogens, and circulating inflammatory cells and cytokines. In addition, practically unrelated diseases that fulfill these criteria have started to emerge as multimorbidities during the last decades.

These choroidal hyperTDs arise from focal attenuation or loss of the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). We previously reported that once large hyperTDs formed, they were likely to persist compared with smaller lesions that were more likely to be transient. Due to their relative persistence, these large persistent choroidal hyperTDs are a point-of-no-return in the progression of intermediate AMD to the late stage of atrophic AMD. Moreover, the onset of these large choroidal hyperTDs can serve as a clinical trial endpoint when studying therapies that might slow disease progression from intermediate AMD to late atrophic AMD. To confirm the persistence of these large choroidal hyperTDs, we studied an independent dataset of AMD eyes enrolled in an ongoing prospective swept-source OCT (SS-OCT) natural history study to determine their overall persistence. We identified a total of 202 eyes with large choroidal hyperTDs containing 1725 hyperTDs followed for an average of 46.6 months. Of the 1725 large hyperTDs, we found that 1718 (99.6%) persisted while only 7 hyperTDs (0.4%) were non-persistent. Of the 7 non-persistent large hyperTDs in 6 eyes, their average GLD at baseline was 385 μm. Of the large hyperTDs ranging in size between 250 and 300 μm when first detected, only one was not persistent with a baseline GLD of 283 μm. In 6 of the non-persistent hyperTDs, the loss of a detectable large hyperTD was due to the accumulation of hyperreflective material along the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and in the retina over the area where the hyperTD was located. This hyperreflective material is thought to represent the migration and aggregation of RPE cells into this focal region where the choroidal hyperTD arose due to attenuated or lost RPE.",,,prosenfeld@miami.edu.

Post hoc analysis of the phase 3 UNIFI induction trial (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT02407236) was conducted. Participants with moderately to severely active UC were randomized to receive ustekinumab or placebo. Treatment assignment was the criterion to assess responsiveness, which was quantified using the probability of a treated participant having a larger change in score than a placebo participant, termed the win probability (WinP), and estimated using nonparametric methods. The UC-100 score demonstrated large responsiveness (WinP 0.72 [95% confidence interval: 0.66-0.78]), and the MCS (0.68 [0.62-0.73]), mMS (0.69 [0.63-0.75]), and pMS (0.65 [0.59-0.71]) demonstrated similar effect sizes.

(1) Excisional biopsies with 1-3 mm margins should be performed when feasible for clinically suspicious melanocytic neoplasms. (2) Definitive surgical treatment for CM, including wide local excision and sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB), should follow National Comprehensive Cancer Network Guidelines in the absence of data from pediatric-specific surgery trials and/or cohort studies. (3) Accurate classification of ASTs as benign or malignant is more likely with immunohistochemistry and next-generation sequencing. (4) It may not be possible to classify some ASTs as likely/definitively benign or malignant after clinicopathologic and/or molecular correlation, and these Spitz tumors of uncertain malignant potential should be excised with 5 mm margins. (5) ASTs favored to be benign should be excised with 1- to 3-mm margins if transected on biopsy. (6) Re-excision is not necessary if the AST does not extend to the biopsy margin(s) when complete/excisional biopsy was performed. (7) SLNB should not be performed for Spitz tumors unless a diagnosis of CM is favored on clinicopathologic evaluation. (8) Non-Spitz melanocytomas have a presumed increased risk for progression to CM and should be excised with 1- to 3-mm margins if transected on biopsy. (9) Re-excision of non-Spitz melanocytomas is not necessary if the lesion is completely excised on biopsy.",Ko JS,Department of Anatomic Pathology,

Fit-for-purpose patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) that assess AD-related pruritus, skin pain and sleep disturbance are important for evaluating the effectiveness of new AD treatments. To evaluate the content validity of five AD-related PROMs in adolescents and adults with moderate-to-severe AD [the Worst Pruritus Numeric Rating Scale (NRS), the AD Skin Pain NRS, the Sleep Disturbance NRS, the skin pain-specific Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC) and the skin pain-specific Patient Global Impression of Severity (PGIS)], and to assess patient-reported experience with pruritus, skin pain and sleep disturbance. A qualitative study in adolescents (aged 12-17 years) and adults (aged ≥ 18 years) with moderate-to-severe AD was conducted in two consecutive stages. In each stage, two iterative rounds of individual interviews were conducted by experienced interviewers. All interviews included concept elicitation and cognitive debriefing components. Data were analysed using thematic analysis. Twenty-seven adults and 20 adolescents with moderate-to-severe AD took part in the initial content evaluation (stage 1) of the Worst Pruritus NRS (1.0) and AD Skin Pain NRS (1.0) (n = 26; 16 adults, 10 adolescents) and in the subsequent content evaluation (stage 2) of the revised Worst Pruritus NRS (1.1), revised AD Skin Pain NRS (1.1), Sleep Disturbance NRS, skin pain-specific PGIC and skin pain-specific PGIS (n = 21; 11 adults, 10 adolescents). The results were generally aligned and consistent for adult and adolescent participants. Additionally, we found that sleep disturbance is relevant and important for evaluation in adults and adolescents with moderate-to-severe AD (stage 2), while also providing further confirmation of this for pruritus and skin pain (stages 1 and 2). Our findings support the content validity of the revised Worst Pruritus NRS (1.1), revised AD Skin Pain NRS (1.1), Sleep Disturbance NRS, skin pain-specific PGIC and skin pain-specific PGIS in individuals aged ≥ 12 years with moderate-to-severe AD. Furthermore, the findings support sleep disturbance, skin pain and pruritus as being relevant and important for adolescents and adults with moderate-to-severe AD. Atopic dermatitis (or ‘AD’ for short) is also known as ‘eczema’. It causes itchy, dry and painful or inflamed skin. AD affects millions of people in the USA and many cases are moderate or severe. As treatments for AD are developed, clinical trials need ways to measure how well a treatment works. Patient-reported outcome measures (or ‘PROMs’) are questionnaires answered only by patients that record people's experiences with their condition or treatment. We interviewed 27 adults and 20 adolescents with moderate-to-severe AD to see how well five different PROMs measuring AD symptoms line up with real experiences. Based on their answers, we found that adults and adolescents have similar experiences with AD symptoms, including itch, skin, pain and sleep disturbance. Our results suggest that these PROMs are easy to understand when people with AD are asked about their most important symptoms. The interviews confirmed that itch, skin pain and sleep disturbances cause major problems and disruptions for people with AD. This highlights the need to track these symptoms and their effects in clinical trials for AD treatments.",Reckleff J; Zhao Y; Clark M; Kosa K; Harris N; Esfandiari E; Martin S; Whalley D,Kyowa Kirin; Amgen; Kyowa Kirin International; RTI Health Solutions,

We report outcomes with cilta-cel in the standard-of-care setting. Patients with RRMM who underwent leukapheresis for cilta-cel manufacturing between 1 March 2022 and 31 December 2022 at 16 US academic medical centers were included. Overall, 255 patients underwent leukapheresis and 236 (92.5%) received cilta-cel, of which 54% would not have met CARTITUDE-1 eligibility criteria. In treated patients (N = 236), cytokine release syndrome was seen in 75% (grade ≥3, 5%), immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome in 14% (grade ≥3, 4%), and delayed neurotoxicity in 10%. Overall and complete response rates were as follows: all patients who received cilta-cel (N = 236), 89% and 70%; patients receiving conforming cilta-cel (n = 191), 94% and 74%; and conforming cilta-cel with fludarabine/cyclophosphamide lymphodepletion (n = 152), 95% and 76%, respectively. Nonrelapse mortality was 10%, most commonly from infection. After a median follow-up of 13 months from cilta-cel, the median progression-free survival (PFS) was not reached, with 12-month estimate being 68% (95% confidence interval, 62-74). High ferritin levels, high-risk cytogenetics, and extramedullary disease were independently associated with inferior PFS, with a signal for prior B-cell maturation antigen-targeted therapy (P = .08). Second primary malignancies excluding nonmelanoma skin cancers were seen in 5.5% and myeloid malignancies/acute leukemia in 1.7%.

Glycans linked to the Fc portion of IgG are found in all IgG antibodies, while about one-fifth of IgG antibodies in plasma also have glycans attached to the Fab portion of IgG. The IgG3 subclass is characterized by more complex glycosylation compared to other IgG subclasses. In this review, we discuss the significant influence that glycans exert on the structural and functional properties of IgG. We provide a comprehensive overview of how the composition of these glycans can affect IgG's effector functions by modulating its interactions with Fcγ receptors and other molecules such as the C1q component of complement, which in turn influence various immune responses triggered by IgG, including antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) and complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC). In addition, the importance of glycans for the efficacy of therapeutics like monoclonal antibodies and intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) therapy is discussed. Moreover, we offer insights into IgG glycosylation characteristics and roles derived from general population, disease-specific, and interventional studies. These studies indicate that IgG glycans are important biomarkers and functional effectors in health and disease.",,,

It also provides fertile soil for tumor metastases, which tend to be more resistant to checkpoint blockade immunotherapy than metastases in other organs. This resistance may result from the sum of incremental evolutionary adaptions in various cell types to prevent overaction to antigens absorbed from the gut into the portal circulation or it might involve a central mechanism. Here, we propose that metabolism of vitamin A, which is highly concentrated in the liver, is a root source of tolerance and resistance of hepatic metastases to checkpoint blockade. Suppression of retinoic acid synthesis from vitamin A with disulfiram may mitigate tolerance and produce enhanced immunotherapy treatment results for patients with liver metastases.",,,

The prospective MATCH-R trial (NCT02517892), led by Gustave Roussy, aimed to characterize resistance mechanisms to cancer treatments through molecular analysis of fresh tumor biopsies. This report presents the genomic data analysis of the MATCH-R study conducted from 2015 to 2022 and focuses on targeted therapies. The study included resistant metastatic patients (pts) who accepted an image-guided tumor biopsy. After evaluation of tumor content (TC) in frozen tissue biopsies, targeted NGS (10 < TC < 30%) or Whole Exome Sequencing and RNA sequencing (TC > 30%) were performed before and/or after the anticancer therapy. Patient-derived xenografts (PDX) were established by implanting tumor fragments into NOD scid gamma mice and amplified up to five passages. A total of 1,120 biopsies were collected from 857 pts with the most frequent tumor types being lung (38.8%), digestive (16.3%) and prostate (14.1%) cancer. Molecular targetable driver were identified in 30.9% (n = 265/857) of the patients, with EGFR (41.5%), FGFR2/3 (15.5%), ALK (11.7%), BRAF (6.8%), and KRAS (5.7%) being the most common altered genes. Furthermore, 66.0% (n = 175/265) had a biopsy at progression on targeted therapy. Among resistant cases, 41.1% (n = 72/175) had no identified molecular mechanism, 32.0% (n = 56/175) showed on-target resistance, and 25.1% (n = 44/175) exhibited a by-pass resistance mechanism. Molecular profiling of the 44 patients with by-pass resistance identified 51 variants, with KRAS (13.7%), PIK3CA (11.8%), PTEN (11.8%), NF2 (7.8%), AKT1 (5.9%), and NF1 (5.9%) being the most altered genes. Treatment was tailored for 45% of the patients with a resistance mechanism identified leading to an 11 months median extension of clinical benefit. A total of 341 biopsies were implanted in mice, successfully establishing 136 PDX models achieving a 39.9% success rate. PDX models are available for EGFR (n = 31), FGFR2/3 (n = 26), KRAS (n = 18), ALK (n = 16), BRAF (n = 6) and NTRK (n = 2) driven cancers. These models closely recapitulate the biology of the original tumors in term of molecular alterations and pharmacological status, and served as valuable models to validate overcoming treatment strategies.

The gut microbiome plays an important role in the onset and progression of alcohol-associated liver disease. Excessive alcohol consumption disrupts the intestinal barrier, facilitating the entry of harmful microbes and their products into the liver, exacerbating liver damage. Dysbiosis, marked by imbalance in gut bacteria, correlates with ALD severity. Promising microbiota-centered therapies include probiotics, phages, and fecal microbiota transplantation.

The effect of PEX on survival outcomes outside of clinical trials is not yet well established. In this study we aimed to evaluate the real-world use and outcomes of PEX for the treatment of ALF. This multicentre retrospective cohort study included consecutive patients with ALF admitted to all seven tertiary liver transplant centres in the UK between June 2013 and December 2021. Changes in clinical variables following PEX treatment were assessed, while overall survival and transplant-free survival up to hospital discharge in patients receiving PEX were compared to those receiving standard medical therapy Propensity score matching was performed to control for intergroup covariates and selection bias. We included 378 patients with ALF (median [IQR] age 36 (28-48), 64% [n = 242] female) of whom 120 received PEX. There was a significant improvement in most clinical variables following PEX, including median dose of noradrenaline (reduction from 0.35 μg/kg/min [0.19-0.70 μg/kg/min] to 0.16 μg/kg/min [0.08-0.49], p = 0.001). There was no significant difference between PEX and standard medical therapy groups in overall survival (51.4% vs. 62.6%, respectively, p = 0.12) or transplant-free survival (42.6% vs. 53.1%, p = 0.24). PEX is now frequently used in the management of patients with ALF in the UK. It is associated with significant improvement in haemodynamic parameters but not survival benefit. Therapeutic plasma exchange is frequently used in the management of patients with acute liver failure in the UK. This real-world study demonstrates significant improvement in haemodynamic status but has not confirmed the survival benefit seen in previous published literature.

To address the real-world implications of the FVIII mimetic antibody, emicizumab, and the role of IST, we retrospectively collected de-identified data on 62 patients with AHA who were treated off-label with emicizumab for a median of 10 weeks at 12 US-based hemophilia treatment centers. Most patients (95.2%) had acute bleeding at diagnosis, and 62.9% had partial or no control of bleeds despite the use of hemostatic agents at the time emicizumab was started. The main reason for initiating emicizumab was outpatient bleeding prophylaxis. After initiation of emicizumab, 87.1% had no additional bleeds. There were 6 breakthrough bleeds (2 spontaneous) in 5 patients and no fatal bleeding events during maintenance emicizumab treatment. The mean breakthrough bleed rate per patient-week was 0.02 (95% confidence interval, 0.0-0.03) during the first 12 weeks of emicizumab for the 55 patients with at least 12 weeks of follow-up. Of these patients, 92.7% received IST and 74.5% were prescribed rituximab-based regimens. Complete resolution of inhibitor and normalization of FVIII levels occurred in 56% overall and in 63% of the patients treated with rituximab. Overall, the median time to discontinuation of emicizumab and IST was 18 weeks. Two patients had thrombotic events while on emicizumab, but no adverse events were attributed to emicizumab and there were no infections attributed to IST. Emicizumab provides effective outpatient bleeding prophylaxis for AHA, and concurrent IST may further mitigate bleeding.",,,

This study introduces a three-dimensional (3D) self-assembled in vitro model of the human neurovascular unit to recapitulate some of the complex interactions between the BBB and AD pathologies. It incorporates primary human brain endothelial cells, pericytes and astrocytes, and stem cell-derived neurons and astrocytes harboring Familial AD (FAD) mutations. Over an extended co-culture period, the model demonstrates increased BBB permeability, dysregulation of key endothelial and pericyte markers, and morphological alterations mirroring AD pathologies. The model enables visualization of amyloid-beta (Aβ) accumulation in both neuronal and vascular compartments. This model may serve as a versatile tool for neuroscience research and drug development to provide insights into the dynamic relationship between vascular dysfunction and AD pathogenesis.",,,mjorfi@mgh.harvard.edu.

This study evaluated the multitargeted VEGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) regorafenib in patients with R/M ACC. Patients with progressive R/M ACC were treated with regorafenib until disease progression, consent withdrawal, or excessive toxicity. The co-primary endpoints were best overall response and 6-month progression-free survival (PFS). Genomic and transcriptomic biomarker analyses were performed in tumors from trial participants. Thirty-eight patients were enrolled, including 7 (18%) patients with prior VEGFR TKIs. No objective responses were observed. The 6-month PFS was 45%, and the median PFS was 7.2 months (95% confidence interval, 5.2-11.9 months). The presence of either activating NOTCH1 (22%) or KDM6A alterations (24%) was associated with decreased PFS [HR 2.6; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.1-6.1; P = 0.03]. Bulk RNA sequencing of pretreatment tumors revealed that regorafenib clinical benefit (CB; PFS ≥ 6 months; n = 11) was associated with the native enrichment of immune-related signatures. Immune deconvolution revealed a greater degree of macrophage and T-cell infiltration in CB tumors. Tumors from patients with no clinical benefit (NCB; PFS < 6 months; n = 9) had greater expression of signatures related to cell-cycle progression (E2F targets, G2-M checkpoint). The trial failed to meet the prespecified 6-month PFS and best overall response targets. We hypothesize that TKI efficacy may be reliant upon an interplay between kinase inhibition and the ACC immune microenvironment, whereas programs promoting cell-cycle progression may contribute to TKI resistance.

However, to prevent/treat dementia effectively, we require biomarkers for non-AD neuropathologies; for this, neuropathologic examinations and annotated tissue samples are essential. We conducted clinicopathologic correlation for the first 100 Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) Neuropathology Core (NPC) cases. Clinical syndromes in this cohort showed 95% sensitivity and 79% specificity for predicting high/intermediate ADNC, a 21% false positive rate, and a ∼44% false negative rate. In addition, 60% with high/intermediate ADNC harbored additional potentially dementing co-pathologies. These results suggest that clinical presentation imperfectly predicts ADNC and that accurate prediction of high/intermediate ADNC does not exclude co-pathology that may modify presentation, biomarkers, and therapeutic responses. Therefore, new biomarkers are needed for non-AD neuropathologies. The ADNI NPC supports this mission with well-characterized tissue samples (available through ADNI and the National Institute on Aging) and ""gold-standard"" diagnostic information (soon to include digital histology).

Precise regulation of receptor expression provides the necessary balance to achieve healthy immune homeostasis by establishing an appropriate immune threshold to limit autoimmunity but respond effectively to infection. The underlying genetics of the FCGR gene family are central to achieving this immune threshold by regulating affinity for IgG, signaling efficacy, and receptor expression. The FCGR gene locus was duplicated during evolution, retaining very high homology and resulting in a genomic region that is technically difficult to study. Here, we review the recent evolution of the gene family in mammals, its complexity and variation through copy number variation and single-nucleotide polymorphism, and impact of these on disease incidence, resolution, and therapeutic antibody efficacy. We also discuss the progress and limitations of current approaches to study the region and emphasize how new genomics technologies will likely resolve much of the current confusion in the field.

The short oligo allows us to focus on the role of N-N interaction. We have developed a sensitive FRET assay to interrogate LLPS assembly reactions from the perspective of the oligonucleotide. We find that N alone can form oligomers but that oligonucleotide enables their assembly into a three-dimensional phase. At a ∼1:1 ratio of N to oligonucleotide, LLPS formation is maximal. We find that a modest excess of N or of nucleic acid causes the LLPS to break down catastrophically. Under the conditions examined here, assembly has a critical concentration of about 1 μM. The responsiveness of N condensates to their environment may have biological consequences. A better understanding of how nucleic acid modulates N-N association will shed light on condensate activity and could inform antiviral strategies targeting LLPS.",,,azlotnic@iu.edu.

The diagnosis has a significant impact on the quality of life for patients and their families. An effective management approach depends on accurate, safe, and easily implementable diagnostic methods. We previously developed a cell-based assay using Hoxb8 mast cells (Hoxb8 MCs) aimed at improving clinical allergy diagnosis. In this study, we assessed its diagnostic performance by measuring blinded sera from a prospectively enrolled and pre-validated peanut allergy cohort. Hoxb8 MCs were passively sensitized with sera from peanut-allergic and peanut tolerant children and adolescents (n = 112). Degranulation of Hoxb8 MCs was quantified upon stimulation with dose-titrated peanut extract by means of flow cytometry, using CD107a as activation marker. The results from the Hoxb8 mast cell activation test (Hoxb8 MAT) were compared to established diagnostic assays such as the skin prick test (SPT), specific IgE (sIgE) levels, and the basophil activation test (BAT). Additionally, serum samples from BAT nonresponders were assessed with the Hoxb8 MAT. Hoxb8 MAT displayed a robust dose-dependent activation to peanut extract, with a cutoff value of ≤5.2% CD107a positive cells. The diagnostic accuracy was highest at allergen concentrations ≥100 ng/mL, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.97, 93% sensitivity, and 96% specificity, outperforming traditional SPT and sIgE tests. When compared to BAT, Hoxb8 MAT exhibited comparable diagnostic efficacy. Moreover, sera from BAT nonresponders were accurately classified into allergics and nonallergics by the Hoxb8 MAT. The Hoxb8 MAT demonstrated a very good diagnostic precision in patients prospectively assessed for peanut allergy comparable to the fresh whole blood-based BAT. Additionally, it demonstrated its value for accurate classification of BAT nonresponders into allergic and nonallergic individuals. Further investigations into its utility in the routine clinical setting are warranted.",,,

Antibody titers were measured for 208 adult participants at day 28, 3 months, and 6 months using a microneutralization assay against different Omicron subvariants. We developed four specific Bayesian statistical models based on a core model, accounting for vaccine-specific antibody decline, boosting of nAb for breakthrough infection, and risk of infection according to nAb levels. The model findings were cross-verified using another validated microneutralization assay. The decrease in nAb titers was significantly lower for the B.1.351 vaccine than for the other booster formulations. An inverse relationship was found between risk of infection upon exposure and nAb levels. With Omicron BA.1 data, these results translated into a positive relative vaccine efficacy against any infection over 6 months for the B.1.351 vaccine compared to the BNT162b2 (31%) and D614 (21%) vaccines. Risk of infection decreased with increasing nAb titers for all vaccines.

The refractory behavior of opportunistic fungi has necessitated the discovery of unconventional antifungals. The emergence of black fungus infection during COVID-19 also triggered the antifungal discovery program. Natural products are one of the alternative sources of antifungals. Endophytic fungi reside and co-evolve within their host plants and, therefore, offer a unique bioresource of novel chemical scaffolds with an array of bioactivities. Hence, immense possibilities exist that these unique chemical scaffolds expressed by the endophytic fungi may play a crucial role in overcoming the burgeoning antimicrobial resistance. These chemical scaffolds so expressed by these endophytic fungi comprise an array of chemical classes beginning from cyclic peptides, sesquiterpenoids, phenols, anthraquinones, coumarins, etc. In this study, endophytic fungi reported in the last six years (2018-2023) have been explored to document the antifungal entities they produce. Approximately 244 antifungal metabolites have been documented in this period by different groups of fungi existing as endophytes. Various aspects of these antifungal metabolites, such as antifungal potential and their chemical structures, have been presented. Yet another unique aspect of this review is the exploration of volatile antifungal compounds produced by these endophytic fungi.

Recent research has highlighted the importance of epithelial-mesenchymal transition between embryonic and endometrial cells in the context of embryo implantation. Additionally, the adverse endometrial environment during implantation has been proposed as a mechanism contributing to infertility in endometriosis. Nevertheless, the role of cadherin molecule alterations in relation to endometrial receptivity and embryo invasion remains a subject of controversy. We investigated the expression patterns of E-cadherin and N-cadherin in the endometria of women with ovarian endometrioma or uterine fibroids and assessed whether they differed from those of healthy women. We enrolled 17 women with ovarian endometrioma, 16 with uterine fibroids, and 6 healthy women. Endometrial tissues were obtained at the mid-secretory phase on days 19-24 of the menstrual cycle. The E-cadherin and N-cadherin mRNA and protein expression levels were measured using quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction and Western blot analysis, respectively. The E-cadherin and N-cadherin mRNA expression levels were higher and lower, respectively, in the endometrium of women with ovarian endometrioma than in those of the controls. In the endometrium of women with uterine fibroids, similar patterns with higher E-cadherin and lower N-cadherin levels were observed compared with that of the controls. Protein expression showed similar patterns. Our findings revealed higher E-cadherin expression and lower N-cadherin expression in the endometria of women with infertility-related diseases than in those of healthy women in the mid-secretory phase.

Only in recent years, from the mid-20th century, we have seen the re-emergence of psychedelics in a therapeutic setting and more specifically for the treatment of addiction. This article aims to review research over the past 40 years using classic (psilocybin, lysergic acid diethylamide [LSD], dimethyltryptamine [DMT], mescaline) and atypical (ketamine, ibogaine, 5-MeO-DMT, 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine) psychedelics for the treatment of addiction. We will start with an overview of the pharmacology and physiological and psychological properties of psychedelic substances from pre-clinical and clinical research. We will then provide an overview of evidence gathered by studies conducted in controlled research environments and naturalistic and ceremonial settings, while we identify the proposed therapeutic mechanisms of each psychedelic substance. Classic and atypical psychedelics show promise as therapeutic alternatives for the treatment of addiction, through the improvement of psychological and physiological symptoms of dependence. A more comprehensive understanding of the ancient and present-day knowledge of the therapeutic potential of psychedelics can facilitate hope for psychedelic therapeutics in the treatment of addiction, especially for individuals who have failed other conventional treatment methods.",,,joanna.vamvakopoulou20@imperial.ac.uk.

Home-based phototherapy is patient preferred but has limited clinical data, particularly in patients with darker skin. To compare the effectiveness of home- vs office-based narrowband UV-B phototherapy for psoriasis. The Light Treatment Effectiveness study was an investigator-initiated, pragmatic, open-label, parallel-group, multicenter, noninferiority randomized clinical trial embedded in routine care at 42 academic and private clinical dermatology practices in the US. Enrollment occurred from March 1, 2019, to December 4, 2023, with follow-up through June 2024. Participants were 12 years and older with plaque or guttate psoriasis who were candidates for home- and office-based phototherapy. Participants were randomized to receive a home narrowband UV-B machine with guided mode dosimetry or routine care with office-based narrowband UV-B for 12 weeks, followed by an additional 12-week observation period. The coprimary effectiveness outcomes were Physician Global Assessment (PGA) dichotomized as clear/almost clear skin (score of ≤1) at the end of the intervention period and Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) score of 5 or lower (no to small effect on quality of life) at week 12. Of 783 patients enrolled (mean [SD] age, 48.0 [15.5] years; 376 [48.0%] female), 393 received home-based phototherapy and 390 received office-based phototherapy, with 350 (44.7%) having skin phototype (SPT) I/II, 350 (44.7%) having SPT III/IV, and 83 (10.6%) having SPT V/VI.

Conventional humanized mouse models of hepatocellular carcinoma patient-derived xenografts (HCC-PDX) encounter limitations in NK cell infiltration, hindering studies on NK cell immunobiology. Here, we introduce an improved humanized mouse model with restored NK cell reconstitution and infiltration in HCC-PDX, coupled with single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to identify potential anti-HCC treatments. A single administration of adeno-associated virus carrying human interleukin-15 reinstated persistent NK cell reconstitution and infiltration in HCC-PDX in humanized mice. scRNA-seq revealed NK cell and T cell subpopulations with heightened PDCD1 and TIGIT levels. Notably, combination therapy with anti-PD-1 and anti-TIGIT antibodies alleviated HCC burden in humanized mice, demonstrating NK cell-dependent efficacy. Bulk-RNA sequencing analysis also revealed significant alterations in the tumor transcriptome that may contribute to further resistance after combination therapy, warranting further investigations. As an emerging strategy, ongoing clinical trials with anti-PD-1 and anti-TIGIT antibodies provide limited data. The improved humanized mouse HCC-PDX model not only sheds light on the pivotal role of NK cells but also serves as a robust platform for evaluating safety and anti-tumor efficacy of combination therapies and other potential regimens, complementing clinical insights.",Shuen TWH; Toh HC,Division of Medical Oncology,qchen@imcb.a-star.edu.sg.

Radiotherapy can boost anti-tumour immune responses by changing the tumour microenvironment, but it also can cause radiotherapy-induced lymphopenia (RIL), a decrease in circulating lymphocyte counts. RIL has been associated with lower survival in patients undergoing radiotherapy, and new studies have suggested that it can also affect immunotherapy outcome. To study RIL's effects and to explore mitigation treatment strategies, preclinical models closely mimicking the clinical situation are needed. State-of-the-art image-guided small animal irradiators now offer the possibility to target specific organs in small animals to induce RIL, aiding research on its molecular mechanisms and prevention. This review covers the relationship between radiotherapy and RIL, its impact on patient survival, and future directions to generate models to investigate and prevent RIL.",,,

We analysed pancreas, spleen, pancreatic lymph nodes, and duodenum samples from the following donor groups: a) donors with type 1 diabetes (n=71), with (n=35) or without (n=36) insulin-containing islets, (b) donors with single or double islet autoantibody positivity without diabetes (n=22) and c) autoantibody-negative donors without diabetes (control donors) (n=74). Five research laboratories participated in this collaborative effort using approaches for unbiased discovery of RNA viruses (two RNA-Seq platforms), targeted detection of  Direct RNA-Seq did not detect virus signal in pancreas samples, whereas RT-PCR detected enterovirus RNA confirmed by sequencing in low amounts in pancreas samples in three of the five donor groups, namely donors with type 1 diabetes with insulin-containing islets, 16% (5/32) donors being positive, donors with single islet autoantibody positivity with 53% (8/15) donors being positive, and non-diabetic donors with 8% (4/49) being enterovirus RNA positive. Detection of enterovirus RNA was significantly more frequent in single islet autoantibody-positive donors compared to donors with type 1 diabetes with insulin-deficient islets (p-value <0.001) and control donors (p-value 0.004). In some donors, pancreatic lymph nodes were also positive. RT-PCR detected enterovirus RNA also in spleen of a small number of donors and virus enrichment in susceptible cell lines before RT-PCR resulted in much higher rate in spleen positivity, particularly in donors with type 1 diabetes. Interestingly, the enterovirus strains detected did not cause a typical lytic infection, possibly reflecting their persistence-prone nature. This was the largest coordinated effort to examine the presence of enterovirus RNA in pancreas of organ donors with type 1 diabetes, using a multitude of assays. These findings are consistent with the notion that both the subjects with type 1 diabetes and those with islet autoantibodies may carry a low-grade enterovirus infection in the pancreas and lymphoid tissues.",Plagnol V; ,; Genomics PLC,

It translates an idea for a new drug to bench-level research on how it can be manufactured, formulated, characterized and controlled for use in non-clinical and early clinical trials. From pre-clinical R&D discovery work through the commercial launch, substantial R&D CMC data is generated to develop and optimize cGMP manufacturing and testing operations, while also supporting product comparability, elucidating product / impurity structures, assessing critical quality attributes, developing the drug delivery mode, and developing the product formulation for long-term stability. Significant R&D CMC work continues post-approval to support continuous improvement and market expansion of the commercial product. These activities are crucial elements of Product Lifecycle Management, and taken together, they comprise Pharmaceutical Quality or Chemistry, Manufacturing and Controls (CMC). The objective of this paper is to mitigate the regulatory ambiguity of R&D quality systems with practical, risk-based examples and recommendations when conducting supportive CMC studies for biological products. Making sound strategic CMC decisions under any circumstances assumes data from R&D studies are reliable, traceable, and complete. While there are specific regulatory guidelines on phase-appropriate cGMP activities, none exist for quality practices in R&D CMC laboratories conducting non-cGMP studies. Hindsight is not the time to discover that R&D studies lack key elements that would otherwise have allowed the data to be directly presented to regulators, if needed. There is a strong prospective business interest in protecting considerable investments made for CMC R&D studies.

In this study, we employed an event-based model (EBM) to determine the sequence of occurrence of hippocampal subfield atrophy in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD cohorts. Subjects (207) were included: 86 MCI, 53 AD, and 68 healthy controls from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Participants underwent structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans to analyse the hippocampal subfields. We assigned each patient to a specific EBM stage, based on the number of their abnormal subfields. A combination of 2-year follow-up MRI scans were applied to demonstrate the longitudinal consistency and utility of the model's staging system. The model estimated that the earliest atrophy occurs in the hippocampal fissure, then spreading to other subregions in both MCI and AD. We identified a marked divergence between the sequences of left and right hippocampal subfields atrophy, so inter-hemispheric asymmetry pattern was further analysed. The sequence of asymmetry index (AI) increases beginning in the molecular and granule cell layers of the dentate gyrus (GC-ML-DG), cornus ammonis (CA) 4, and the molecular layer (ML). Longitudinal analysis confirms the efficacy of the model. In addition, the model stages were significantly correlated with patients' memory scores (p < .05). Collectively, we used a data-driven method to provide new insight into AD hippocampal progression. The present model could aid in understanding of the disease stages, as well as tracking memory decline.",,,

Results indicated that the high CPC diet resulted in decreased growth performance and compromised intestinal health. Dietary CT enhanced the growth of fish, improved intestinal function, and optimized intestinal microbiota. Additionally, intestinal transcriptome analysis revealed that dietary CT might mitigate intestinal inflammation by downregulating the related gene expression in the cell adhesion molecule pathway. Furthermore, the gene expression of cd22 and mhc2 was positively correlated with the relative abundance of the Geodermatophilus, an indicator species of intestinal microbiota in high CPC treatment. Our research suggests that the inclusion of CT (3.75 g/kg) in the high CPC diet of largemouth bass can stimulate growth and alleviate negative impacts on intestinal health, indicating that CT can be utilized to enhance the utilization of CPC in fish nutrition.",Liu Y,Wufeng Chicheng Biotech Co.,zhangll@hqu.edu.cn.

All early-phases clinical trials participations for patients with hematological malignancies, from 2008 to 2023, in a tertiary academic center in Europe, were reviewed. Patient's demographics, tumor type categories, therapeutic responses, mortality, overall survival (OS), and investigational product (IP) were assessed. Over the period 2008-2023, 736 patients participating in 92 different early-phases clinical trials, were analyzed. The most common tumor categories were diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (n = 253; 34.4%), acute myeloid leukemia/myelodysplastic syndrome (n = 164; 22.3%) and multiple myeloma (n = 100; 13.6%). The median OS was 14.8 (95% CI: 12.4-17.9) months and response rate 31.9%, including complete responses in 13.5% of patients.

However, the mechanism whereby the cancer cells employ the ECM proteins to facilitate their motility is largely unknown. In this study we used RNA-seq and proteomic analysis to examine the proteins secreted by castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) cells upon TGFβ treatment and found that thrombospondin 1 (THBS1) was observed to be one of the predominant proteins. The CRISPR Cas9, or siRNA techniques was used to downregulate TGFβ type I receptor (TβRI) to interfere with TGFβ signaling in various cancer cells in vitro. The interaction of ECM proteins with the TβRI in the migratory prostate cancer cells in response to TGFβ1 was demonstrated by several different techniques to reveal that THBS1 mediates cell migration by interacting with integrin subunit alpha V (ITGAV) and TβRI. Deletion of TβRI or THBS1 in cancer cells prevented their migration and invasion. THBS1 belongs to a group of tumorigenic ECM proteins induced via TGFβ signaling in CRPC cells, and high expression of THBS1 in human prostate cancer tissues correlated with the degree of malignancy. TGFβ-induced production of THBS1 through TβRI facilitates the invasion and metastasis of CRPC cells as shown in vivo xenograft animal experiments.",,,yabing.mu@umu.se.

We aimed to provide such estimates for the period 1990-2021. We estimated incidence, prevalence, death, and disability-adjusted life-year (DALY) counts and age-standardised rates per 100 000 people per year for overall stroke, ischaemic stroke, intracerebral haemorrhage, and subarachnoid haemorrhage, for 204 countries and territories from 1990 to 2021. We also calculated burden of stroke attributable to 23 risk factors and six risk clusters (air pollution, tobacco smoking, behavioural, dietary, environmental, and metabolic risks) at the global and regional levels (21 GBD regions and Socio-demographic Index [SDI] quintiles), using the standard GBD methodology. 95% uncertainty intervals (UIs) for each individual future estimate were derived from the 2·5th and 97·5th percentiles of distributions generated from propagating 500 draws through the multistage computational pipeline. In 2021, stroke was the third most common GBD level 3 cause of death (7·3 million [95% UI 6·6-7·8] deaths; 10·7% [9·8-11·3] of all deaths) after ischaemic heart disease and COVID-19, and the fourth most common cause of DALYs (160·5 million [147·8-171·6] DALYs; 5·6% [5·0-6·1] of all DALYs). In 2021, there were 93·8 million (89·0-99·3) prevalent and 11·9 million (10·7-13·2) incident strokes. We found disparities in stroke burden and risk factors by GBD region, country or territory, and SDI, as well as a stagnation in the reduction of incidence from 2015 onwards, and even some increases in the stroke incidence, death, prevalence, and DALY rates in southeast Asia, east Asia, and Oceania, countries with lower SDI, and people younger than 70 years. Globally, ischaemic stroke constituted 65·3% (62·4-67·7), intracerebral haemorrhage constituted 28·8% (28·3-28·8), and subarachnoid haemorrhage constituted 5·8% (5·7-6·0) of incident strokes. There were substantial increases in DALYs attributable to high BMI (88·2% [53·4-117·7]), high ambient temperature (72·4% [51·1 to 179·5]), high fasting plasma glucose (32·1% [26·7-38·1]), diet high in sugar-sweetened beverages (23·4% [12·7-35·7]), low physical activity (11·3% [1·8-34·9]), high systolic blood pressure (6·7% [2·5-11·6]), lead exposure (6·5% [4·5-11·2]), and diet low in omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (5·3% [0·5-10·5]). Stroke burden has increased from 1990 to 2021, and the contribution of several risk factors has also increased. Effective, accessible, and affordable measures to improve stroke surveillance, prevention (with the emphasis on blood pressure, lifestyle, and environmental factors), acute care, and rehabilitation need to be urgently implemented across all countries to reduce stroke burden.

Psychiatry,10.1016/S2215-0366(24)00249-9,"Antibodies against the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) have been described in the serum of people with schizophrenia spectrum disorders (schizophrenia). However, the prevalence and clinical relevance of these antibodies in schizophrenia is unclear. This knowledge gap includes the possibility of such antibodies being associated with a distinct clinical profile, which in turn might warrant a distinct treatment approach. We aimed to assess the seroprevalence of anti-NMDAR antibodies in schizophrenia, and compare symptoms and psychosocial functioning between patients with schizophrenia who were seropositive and seronegative for these antibodies. In this case-control comparison, by combining new and existing studies, we included patients diagnosed with schizophrenia from four independent cohorts for whom anti-NMDAR serostatus had been assessed (or could be assessed by us) with live cell-based assays. Included cohorts were from the EULAST study (a trial conducted across 15 European countries and Israel), the OPTiMiSE study (an interventional study in Europe), and the PPiP1 and PPiP2 studies (conducted in the UK). Patients from these cohorts were analysed if they had complete Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) data. No participant had been diagnosed with autoimmune encephalitis or received treatment for this condition. After calculating the prevalence of serum anti-NMDAR antibodies, we examined possible differences in PANSS scores (negative, positive, and general symptom subscales, and total score) between anti-NMDAR-seropositive and anti-NMDAR-seronegative patients. Psychosocial functioning as measured by Personal Social Performance (PSP) score was also compared. All analyses were exploratory and no adjustment was done for multiple testing. People with lived experience were not involved in the conduct of this study. We collected individual patient data from 1114 patients with schizophrenia across the four cohorts. The study population had a mean age of 28·6 years (SD 7·6) and comprised 382 (34·3%) women and 732 (65·7%) men, including patients of White (929 [83·4%]), Asian (54 [4·8%]), Black (68 [6·1%]), and other (62 [5·6%]) ethnicities. Overall, 41 (3·7%) participants (range 3·1-4·0% across cohorts) tested positive for serum anti-NMDAR antibodies. Lower symptom severity on the negative symptoms PANSS subscale was observed for anti-NMDAR-seropositive patients (mean score 15·8 [SD 6·4]) than for anti-NMDAR-seronegative patients (18·2 [6·8]; Cohen's d=0·36; p=0·026), as well as on the general symptoms PANSS subscale (32·9 [8·9] vs 36·1 [10·1]; d=0·33; p=0·029) and total PANSS score (65·5 [18·5] vs 72·6 [19·3]; d=0·37; p=0·013). Mean PSP score was better in anti-NMDAR-positive patients (62·0 [17·0]) than in anti-NMDAR-negative patients (53·5 [16·3]; d=0·52; p=0·014). Serum NMDAR antibodies are present in 3-4% of patients with schizophrenia and are associated with relatively low severity of negative symptoms and relatively good psychosocial functioning. Thus, although the findings await replication in cohorts from other geographical regions, serum anti-NMDAR antibodies might be associated with a different form of psychotic illness. These findings could inform future prognostic and interventional studies examining whether anti-NMDAR antibodies are associated with a specific course of illness or with treatment response.

We investigated the association between baseline plasma miRNAs and central AD biomarkers from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI; N = 803): amyloid, tau, and neurodegeneration (A/T/N). Differentially expressed miRNAs and their targets were identified, followed by pathway enrichment analysis. Machine learning approaches were applied to investigate the role of miRNAs as blood biomarkers. We identified nine, two, and eight miRNAs significantly associated with A/T/N positivity, respectively. We identified 271 genes targeted by amyloid-related miRNAs with estrogen signaling receptor-mediated signaling among the enriched pathways. Additionally, 220 genes targeted by neurodegeneration-related miRNAs showed enrichment in pathways including the insulin growth factor 1 pathway. The classification performance of demographic information for A/T/N positivity was increased up to 9% with the inclusion of miRNAs. Plasma miRNAs were associated with central A/T/N biomarkers, highlighting their potential as blood biomarkers. We performed association analysis of microRNAs (miRNAs) with amyloid/tau/neurodegeneration (A/T/N) biomarker positivity. We identified dysregulated miRNAs for A/T/N biomarker positivity. We identified Alzheimer's disease biomarker-specific/common pathways related to miRNAs. miRNAs improved the classification for A/T/N positivity by up to 9%.

We report the overall survival results from the second interim analysis of this study. Eligible patients with newly diagnosed, high-risk (FIGO 2014 stage IB2-IIB with node-positive disease or stage III-IVA regardless of nodal status), locally advanced, histologically confirmed, squamous cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma, or adenosquamous cervical cancer were randomly assigned 1:1 to receive five cycles of pembrolizumab (200 mg) or placebo every 3 weeks with concurrent chemoradiotherapy, followed by 15 cycles of pembrolizumab (400 mg) or placebo every 6 weeks. Pembrolizumab or placebo and cisplatin were administered intravenously. Patients were stratified at randomisation by planned external beam radiotherapy type (intensity-modulated radiotherapy [IMRT] or volumetric-modulated arc therapy [VMAT] vs non-IMRT or non-VMAT), cervical cancer stage at screening (FIGO 2014 stage IB2-IIB node positive vs III-IVA), and planned total radiotherapy (external beam radiotherapy plus brachytherapy) dose (<70 Gy vs ≥70 Gy [equivalent dose of 2 Gy]). Primary endpoints were progression-free survival per RECIST 1.1 by investigator or by histopathological confirmation of suspected disease progression and overall survival defined as the time from randomisation to death due to any cause. Safety was a secondary endpoint. Between June 9, 2020, and Dec 15, 2022, 1060 patients at 176 sites in 30 countries across Asia, Australia, Europe, North America, and South America were randomly assigned to treatment, with 529 patients in the pembrolizumab-chemoradiotherapy group and 531 patients in the placebo-chemoradiotherapy group. At the protocol-specified second interim analysis (data cutoff Jan 8, 2024), median follow-up was 29·9 months (IQR 23·3-34·3). Median overall survival was not reached in either group; 36-month overall survival was 82·6% (95% CI 78·4-86·1) in the pembrolizumab-chemoradiotherapy group and 74·8% (70·1-78·8) in the placebo-chemoradiotherapy group. The hazard ratio for death was 0·67 (95% CI 0·50-0·90; p=0·0040), meeting the protocol-specified primary objective. 413 (78%) of 528 patients in the pembrolizumab-chemoradiotherapy group and 371 (70%) of 530 in the placebo-chemoradiotherapy group had a grade 3 or higher adverse event, with anaemia, white blood cell count decreased, and neutrophil count decreased being the most common adverse events. Potentially immune-mediated adverse events occurred in 206 (39%) of 528 patients in the pembrolizumab-chemoradiotherapy group and 90 (17%) of 530 patients in the placebo-chemoradiotherapy group.

We conducted a 48-week, open-label, single-arm, single-centre, phase IIIb switch study to evaluate the tolerability, safety and efficacy of switching from stable efavirenz- or dolutegravir-based antiretroviral therapy to doravirine/lamivudine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate in Black women. The 101 participants enrolled (median age 35 years; interquartile range 31-40) were on efavirenz (n = 46; mean duration on therapy 1.7 years) or dolutegravir-based (n = 55; mean duration 1.5 years) antiretrovirals at screening. Retention at 48 weeks was 92/101 participants, and viral suppression was >90% throughout the study, with a single case of doravirine resistance (106 M, V108I and H221Y mutations). The mean weight percentage change at week 48 was 4.7% (95% confidence interval [CI] 3.0-6.5; p < 0.001), and the adjusted mean change was 2.7 kg (95% CI 1.50-3.98; p < 0.001); for efavirenz, the percentage change was 5.0% (95% CI 2.9-7.1; p < 0.001), and the adjusted weight gain was 3.5 kg (95% CI 1.93-5.13); for dolutegravir, the percentage change was 4.5% (95% CI 1.8-7.3; p < 0.001), and the adjusted weight gain was 2.1 kg (95% CI 0.26-3.90). Statistically significant decreases in lipid panel percent mean to week 48 included: total cholesterol -8.4% (95% CI -11.3 to -5.5; p < 0.001), triglycerides -10.4% (95% CI -16.4 to -4.4; p < 0.001) and high-density lipoprotein -14.8% (95% CI -18.5 to -11.2%; p < 0.001), with minor differences when disaggregating the mean percent change in lipids between previous efavirenz/dolutegravir regimens. Adverse events due to doravirine were few and mild. Our findings suggest that a switch to doravirine from efavirenz or dolutegravir is safe and effective in Black women, with significant improvement in lipid profiles, but does not arrest progressive weight gain.",,,

We evaluate how improvements in Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) responses, particularly at incremental improvements approaching complete skin clearance (PASI 100), translate into improvements in health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and patient-perceived symptoms. Data from the BE RADIANT phase 3b trial (NCT03536884) and its open-label extension (OLE), pooled across all study visits and treatments over 16 weeks (randomised patients) and 2 years (patients entering the OLE), were analysed using mixed-effects logistic regression models. Proportions of patients achieving a Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) of 0/1, DLQI item scores of 0, and Psoriasis Symptoms and Impacts Measure (P-SIM) item scores of 0 for itching, scaling, and skin pain at specific PASI improvement levels were estimated. Seven hundred and forty-three patients were randomised to treatment; 654 entered the OLE. Using 16-week pooled data, there were incremental improvements in the proportions of patients estimated by our model to achieve DLQI 0/1 with PASI 100 compared with 95% (PASI = 95%) and 90% (PASI = 90%) improvements in PASI (93.0%, 89.3%, and 83.8% achieving DLQI 0/1, respectively). Estimated proportions achieving DLQI item scores of 0 had the greatest increases at higher PASI improvement levels for Items 1 (itchy, sore, painful, or stinging skin), 2 (embarrassment), and 4 (choice of clothing). Estimated proportions of patients achieving P-SIM = 0 were also higher for PASI 100 (itching: 61.7%; scaling: 82.2%; skin pain: 96.9%) than for PASI = 95% (50.8%; 72.3%; 95.7%) and PASI = 90% (39.8%; 59.5%; 94.0%).

39283415,Impact of Disease Factors of Patients with Psoriasis and Psoriatic Arthritis on Biologic Therapy Switching: Real-World Evidence from the CorEvitas Psoriasis Registry.,,Dermatology and therapy,10.1007/s13555-024-01258-1,"Patients with psoriasis (PSO) and psoriatic arthritis (PsA) may frequently switch biologic therapies over the course of treatment because of symptom variability and individual responses. Real-world studies analyzing patient characteristics and clinical factors associated with biologic switching are limited. This longitudinal cohort study used real-world data from the CorEvitas Psoriasis Registry to evaluate the relationship between associated disease factors and biologic switching among patients with PSO and PsA in the United States (US) and Canada following initiation of a biologic. Patients were evaluated between April 2015-August 2022. Combinations of disease severity (as measured by Psoriasis Area Severity Index [PASI]) and Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) as a measure of health-related quality of life (HRQoL) were assessed, and the association with time to switching was calculated using Cox proportional hazards regression modeling. Among 2580 patient-initiations (instances of patients initiating a biologic), 504 (19.5%) switched biologics within 30 months of initiation. Switching was more frequent when either PASI > 10 or DLQI > 5 compared with PASI ≤ 10 or DLQI ≤ 5 at follow-up. Patients with higher skin involvement (PASI > 10) and impact on HRQoL (DLQI > 5) were 14 times more likely to switch (hazard ratio = 14.2, 95% confidence interval: 10.7, 18.9) than those with lower skin involvement (PASI ≤ 10) and HRQoL (DLQI ≤ 5). Patients with PSO and PsA treated in a real-world dermatology setting with substantial disease factors following biologic initiation were more likely to switch therapies. Those with PASI > 10 and DLQI > 5 switched more frequently than those with PASI ≤ 10 and DLQI ≤ 5. Many patients with psoriasis may also have a related condition called psoriatic arthritis. Biologic medications work by helping to reduce inflammation and are commonly used to treat the symptoms of psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis. Patients might not all respond the same way to treatment and may need to change their medications over time. It is important we understand the reasons for switching medications to help patients better manage their symptoms.This study used information from a database on patients with both psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis. The database includes information on patients’ medical history, including when they start and change their medication. We looked at data from patients who switched medications and patients who did not switch medications and examined differences in both how serious a doctor found their disease and the patients’ own opinions of their overall health.We found that patients were more likely to change their biologic medication if they had more difficult psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis symptoms that caused worse skin problems, joint pain, and effects on their overall health compared with patients who had not changed their medication. These results suggest that it is important to consider both how serious a doctor finds their disease and patients’ opinions of how much their symptoms affect their overall health. Understanding the reasons why patients switch medications will help to develop better ways of managing psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis.",Sima AP; Beaty SW; Low R; Gomez B; Gurrola M,CorEvitas; UCB,lebwohl@aol.com.

A review of the work that supported the inclusion of this imaging modality into ADNI Phase 3 is followed by a brief description of the ADNI MTL imaging and analysis protocols and a summary of studies that have used these data. This review is supplemented by a new study that uses novel surface-based tools to characterize MTL neurodegeneration across biomarker-defined AD stages. This analysis reveals a pattern of spreading cortical thinning associated with increasing levels of tau pathology in the presence of elevated amyloid beta, with apparent epicenters in the transentorhinal region and inferior hippocampal subfields. The paper concludes with an outlook for high-resolution imaging of the MTL in ADNI Phase 4. HIGHLIGHTS: As of Phase 3, the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) protocol includes a high-resolution T2-weighted MRI scan optimized for imaging hippocampal subfields and medial temporal lobe (MTL) subregions. These scans are processed by the ADNI core to obtain automatic segmentations of MTL subregions and to derive morphologic measurements. More detailed granular examination of MTL neurodegeneration in response to disease progression is achieved by applying surface-based modeling techniques. Surface-based analysis of gray matter loss in MTL subregions reveals increasing and spatially expanding patterns of neurodegeneration with advancing stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD), as defined based on amyloid and tau positron emission tomography biomarkers in accordance with recently proposed criteria. These patterns closely align with post mortem literature on spread of pathological tau in AD, supporting the role of tau pathology in the presence of elevated levels of amyloid beta as the driver of neurodegeneration.",Xie L; DeFlores R; ,; Department of Digital Technology and Innovation; UMR-S U1237,

The use of audits to qualify a site is part of the traditional supplier quality models for drug products. Due to the rapid growth of the CGT industry in recent years, healthcare institutions and manufacturers are finding it difficult to manage the increasing workload and resources needed to support audits when they are applied to the provision of Cellular Starting Material (CSM) collection from patients/subjects for the purpose of manufacturing. To alleviate this audit burden, several manufacturers have applied risk-based approaches to determine the needs and scope of audits. The authors of this commentary recommend that all manufacturers utilize a risk-based assessment program when appropriate and explain the use of tools created to facilitate a risk-based approach to streamline and reduce duplicative audits. This approach and tools, created by The NextGen Industry Working Group (IWG) site certification workstream with representation from pharmaceutical and biotech companies, health care institutions, accrediting organizations, and other stakeholders, is aligned with proposals from other multistakeholder groups, including the ASTCT 80/20 Task Force. The tools aim to streamline the site qualification processes performed by each manufacturer, offering a standardized approach to audits or gap analysis assessments. Offering an abbreviated audit model for sites that have already attained accreditation through agencies such as the AABB (Association for the Advancement of Blood & Biotherapies) and FACT (Foundation for the Accreditation of Cellular Therapy), helping the manufacturer to focus on product-specific requirements rather than re-evaluating systems that have already been audited in great detail by other parties.",Holman P; Wacker K; Myers J; Hlucky T; Walters V; Anderson C; Shingler W; Contractor K,Arsenal Biosciences; Kite Pharma/Gilead; Independent Contractor; Vertex Pharmaceuticals; Foundation for the Accreditation of Cellular Therapy; Autolus Ltd,Pholman@ArsenalBio.com.

In this study, we constructed 11 reverse docking pipelines by integrating site prediction tools (PointSite and SiteMap), docking programs (Glide and AutoDock Vina), and scoring functions (Glide, Autodock Vina, RTMScore, DeepRMSD, and OnionNet-SFCT), and then thoroughly benchmarked their predictive capabilities. The results show that the Glide_SFCT (PS) pipeline exhibited the best target prediction performance based on the atomic structure models in AlphaFold2 human proteome. It achieved a success rate of 27.8% when considering the top 100 ranked prediction. This pipeline effectively narrows the range of potential targets within the human proteome, laying a foundation for drug target prediction, off-target assessment, and toxicity prediction, ultimately boosting drug development.

Exogenous ROS can injure mitochondria and induce them to generate more endogenous mitochondrial ROS to further perpetuate the deteriorating condition in the affected cells. Dysfunction of these cancer mitochondria may possibly be offset by the Warburg effect, which is characterized by amplified glycolysis and metabolic reprogramming. ROS from neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) are an essential element for neutrophils to defend against invading pathogens or to kill cancer cells. A chronic inflammation typically includes consecutive NET activation and tissue damage, as well as tissue repair, and together with NETs, ROS would participate in both the destruction and progression of cancers.

Although it is known that both temperature and mechanical stimulation affect the metabolism of chondrocytes, little is known about the thermal properties of agarose hydrogels. Thermal properties of agarose are needed to analyze potential heat production by chondrocytes induced by various experimental stimuli (carbon source, cyclical compression, etc). Utilizing ASTM C177, a custom-built thermal conductivity measuring device was constructed and used to calculate the thermal conductivity of 4.5 % low gelling temperature agarose hydrogels. Additionally, Differential Scanning Calorimetry was used to calculate the specific heat capacity of the agarose hydrogels. Testing of chondrocyte-embedded agarose hydrogels commonly occurs in Phosphate-Buffered Saline (PBS), and thermal analysis requires the free convection coefficient of PBS. This was calculated using a 2D heat conduction simulation within MATLAB in tandem with experimental data collected for known boundary and initial conditions.

Blood was also collected for centralized testing using an established antibody assay (GenScript cPass). A nested case-control study assessed if POC tests conducted on stored specimens were predictive of time to sustained recovery, mortality, and a composite safety outcome. While both POC tests exhibited moderate agreement with the GenScript assay (both agreeing with 89% of antibody determinations), they were significantly different from the GenScript assay. Treating the GenScript assay as the gold standard, the LumiraDx assay had 99.5% sensitivity and 58.1% specificity whereas the RightSign assay had 89.5% sensitivity and 84.0% specificity. The LumiraDx assay frequently gave indeterminant results. Both tests were significantly associated with clinical outcomes. Although both POC tests deviated moderately from the GenScript assay, they predicted outcomes of interest.

Commensurate to the vast array of gastrointestinal functions they influence, EGCs exhibit considerable diversity in terms of location, morphology, molecular profiles, and functional attributes. However, the mechanisms underlying this diversification of EGCs remain largely unexplored. To begin unraveling the mechanistic complexities of EGC diversity, the current study aimed to examine its spatiotemporal aspects in greater detail, and to assess whether the various sources of enteric neural progenitors contribute differentially to this diversity. Based on established topo-morphological criteria for categorizing EGCs into four main subtypes, our detailed immunofluorescence analyses first revealed that these subtypes emerge sequentially during early postnatal development, in a coordinated manner with the structural changes that occur in the ENS. When combined with genetic cell lineage tracing experiments, our analyses then uncovered a strongly biased contribution by Schwann cell-derived enteric neural progenitors to particular topo-morphological subtypes of EGCs. Taken together, these findings provide a robust foundation for further investigations into the molecular and cellular mechanisms governing EGC diversity.",,,

Building on recent clinical observations, this study aimed to determine whether ""lead-in"" calorie restriction before administering clinically approved weight loss medications enhances the maximum achievable weight loss in preclinical models. Diet-induced obese mice (DIO) were exposed to 7 or 14 days of calorie restriction before initiating treatment with semaglutide (a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R) agonist), tirzepatide (a GLP-1R/glucose insulinotropic peptide receptor (GIPR) co-agonist), or setmelanotide (a melanocortin-4 receptor (MC4R) agonist). Follow-up assessments using indirect calorimetry determined the contributions of energy intake and expenditure linked to consecutive exposure to dieting followed by pharmacotherapy. Calorie restriction prior to treatment with semaglutide or tirzepatide enhanced the weight loss magnitude of both incretin-based therapies in DIO mice, reflected by a reduction in fat mass and linked to reduced energy intake and a less pronounced adaptive drop in energy expenditure. These benefits were not observed with the MC4R agonist, setmelanotide. Our findings provide compelling evidence that calorie restriction prior to incretin-based therapy enhances the achievable extent of weight loss, as reflected in a weight loss plateau at a lower level compared to that of treatment without prior calorie reduction. This work suggests that more intensive lifestyle interventions should be considered prior to pharmacological treatment, encouraging further exploration and discussion of the current standard of care.",,,chc@sund.ku.dk.

While the transport of DNA is generally understood, methods to induce unfolded protein translocation have only recently been discovered (Yu et al., 2023, Sauciuc et al., 2023). Here, we found that during electroosmotically driven translocation of polypeptides, blob-like structures typically form inside nanopores, often obstructing their transport and preventing addressing individual amino acids. This is in contrast with the electrophoretic transport of DNA, where the formation of such structures has not been reported. Comparisons between different nanopore sizes and shapes and modifications by different surface chemistries allowed formulating a mechanism for blob formation. We also show that single-file transport can be achieved by using 1) nanopores that have an entry and an internal diameter smaller than the persistence length of the polymer, 2) nanopores with a nonsticky (i.e",,,

Obesity is linked to chronic inflammation, which can contribute to psoriasis pathogenesis. Fixed-dose therapies may have reduced efficacy in patients with a higher body mass index, while weight-based dosing can increase the burden of drug-specific side effects. Alcohol and nicotine from tobacco have also been shown to stimulate keratinocyte and immune cell proliferation and production of proinflammatory cytokines. While these risk factors are prevalent among patients with moderate-to-severe psoriasis, their influence on treatment outcomes may be overlooked when evaluating therapeutic options. Brodalumab is a fully human interleukin-17 receptor A antagonist approved for the treatment of moderate-to-severe psoriasis. In this review, we describe the lifestyle-related risk factors associated with decreased response to treatment. We further summarize the post hoc analyses of brodalumab in participant subgroups with moderate-to-severe psoriasis and a history of prior biologic failure, obesity, and alcohol or tobacco use from two phase 3 clinical trials (AMAGINE-2 and AMAGINE-3; ClinicalTrials.gov identifiers: NCT01708603 and NCT01708629, respectively).

In retrospective studies, artificial intelligence (AI) has proven to be helpful for enhancing melanoma detection. However, there are few prospective studies confirming these promising results. Existing studies are limited by low sample sizes, too homogenous datasets, or lack of inclusion of rare melanoma subtypes, preventing a fair and thorough evaluation of AI and its generalizability, a crucial aspect for its application in the clinical setting. Therefore, we assessed ""All Data are Ext"" (ADAE), an established open-source ensemble algorithm for detecting melanomas, by comparing its diagnostic accuracy to that of dermatologists on a prospectively collected, external, heterogeneous test set comprising eight distinct hospitals, four different camera setups, rare melanoma subtypes, and special anatomical sites. We advanced the algorithm with real test-time augmentation (R-TTA, i.e., providing real photographs of lesions taken from multiple angles and averaging the predictions), and evaluated its generalization capabilities. Overall, the AI shows higher balanced accuracy than dermatologists (0.798, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.779-0.814 vs. 0.781, 95% CI 0.760-0.802; p = 4.0e-145), obtaining a higher sensitivity (0.921, 95% CI 0.900-0.942 vs. 0.734, 95% CI 0.701-0.770; p = 3.3e-165) at the cost of a lower specificity (0.673, 95% CI 0.641-0.702 vs. 0.828, 95% CI 0.804-0.852; p = 3.3e-165). As the algorithm exhibits a significant performance advantage on our heterogeneous dataset exclusively comprising melanoma-suspicious lesions, AI may offer the potential to support dermatologists, particularly in diagnosing challenging cases. Melanoma is a type of skin cancer that can spread to other parts of the body, often resulting in death. Early detection improves survival rates. Computational tools that use artificial intelligence (AI) can be used to detect melanoma. However, few studies have checked how well the AI works on real-world data obtained from patients. We tested a previously developed AI tool on data obtained from eight different hospitals that used different types of cameras, which also included images taken of rare melanoma types and from a range of different parts of the body.

We identified the MTL substructures significantly associated with tau-positron emission tomography (PET) signal in 581 non-demented individuals from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI-3). We confirmed our results in our UCLouvain cohort including 110 non-demented individuals by comparing volumes between individuals with different visual Braak's stages and clinical diagnosis. Four amygdala subnuclei (cortical, central, medial, and accessory basal) were associated with tau in amyloid beta-positive (Aβ+) clinically normal (CN) individuals, while the global amygdala and hippocampal volumes were not. Using UCLouvain data, we observed that both Braak I-II and Aβ+ CN individuals had smaller volumes in these subnuclei, while no significant difference was observed in the global structure volumes or other subfields. Measuring specific amygdala subnuclei, early atrophy may serve as a marker of temporal tauopathy in preclinical AD, identifying individuals at risk of progression. Amygdala atrophy is not homogeneous in preclinical Alzheimer's disease (AD). Tau pathology is associated with atrophy of specific amygdala subnuclei, specifically, the central, medial, cortical, and accessory basal subnuclei. Hippocampal and amygdala volume is not associated with tau in preclinical AD. Hippocampus and CA1-3 volume is reduced in preclinical AD, regardless of tau.",,,

Using a public database, we identified new molecular entities (NMEs) approved for hematologic malignancies in the US from January 2011 to December 2022. They were divided into those submitted by non-global companies (non-global group) and those by global companies (global group). We identified 48 NMEs, of which 19 (40%) were classified as non-global. Of these, 13 (68%) were from US-based companies. In the non-global group, 63% (12/19) of the NMEs had received accelerated approval in the US, of which only 50% (6/12) had a post-approval confirmatory trial by September 2023. Regarding the impact on the approval in the European Union (EU) and Japan, the unapproval rate of 2 years after US approval was higher in the non-global group than in the global group in the EU (56% vs. 21%) and Japan (94% vs. 64%). In conclusion, many NMEs from non-global companies had received accelerated approval in the US based on phase I/II trials.

39250758,A practical guide to using oral Janus kinase inhibitors for atopic dermatitis from the International Eczema Council.,2024-12-22,The British journal of dermatology,10.1093/bjd/ljae342,"Janus kinase inhibitors (JAKi) have the potential to alter the landscape of atopic dermatitis (AD) management dramatically, owing to promising efficacy results from phase III trials and their rapid onset of action. However, JAKi are not without risk, and their use is not appropriate for all patients with AD, making this a medication class that dermatologists should understand and consider when treating patients with moderate-to-severe AD. To provide a consensus expert opinion statement from the International Eczema Council (IEC) that provides a pragmatic approach to prescribing JAKi, including choosing appropriate patients and dosing, clinical and laboratory monitoring and advice about long-term use. An international cohort of authors from the IEC with expertise in JAKi selected topics of interest were placed into authorship groups covering 10 subsections. The groups performed topic-specific literature reviews, consulted up-to-date adverse event (AE) data, referred to product labels and provided analysis and expert opinion. The manuscript guidance and recommendations were reviewed by all authors, as well as the IEC Research Committee. We recommend that JAKi be considered for patients with moderate-to-severe AD seeking the benefits of a rapid reduction in disease burden and itch, oral administration and the potential for flexible dosing. Baseline risk factors should be assessed prior to prescribing JAKi, including increasing age, venous thromboembolisms, malignancy, cardiovascular health, kidney/liver function, pregnancy and lactation, and immunocompetence. Patients being considered for JAKi treatment should be current on vaccinations and we provide a generalized framework for laboratory monitoring, although clinicians should consult individual product labels for recommendations as there are variations among the different JAKi. Patients who achieve disease control should be maintained on the lowest possible dose, as many of the observed AEs occurred in a dose-dependent manner. Future studies are needed in patients with AD to assess the durability and safety of continuous long-term JAKi use, combination medication regimens and the effects of flexible, episodic treatment over time. The decision to initiate JAKi treatment should be shared between the patient and provider, accounting for AD severity and personal risk-benefit assessment, including consideration of baseline health risk factors, monitoring requirements and treatment costs. Drugs called Janus kinase inhibitors (‘JAKi’ for short) have the potential to change how atopic dermatitis (or ‘AD’) is treated. Promising results from clinical trials and their ability to work quickly make JAKi a type of medication that should be considered for treating moderate-to-severe AD. There are some risks with JAKi treatment and they are not appropriate for all people with AD. Researchers from around the world reviewed the published information on JAKi. We provide a sensible approach to prescribing these drugs. We considered three JAKi used to treat AD. Although each JAKi is different in how effective it is and what the side effects are, we have tried to provide general guidance that may be used for all JAKi. This guidance allows for standardization and simplification of prescribing JAKi to treat AD. However, some procedures or how often monitoring is done, are slightly different for each JAKi. Using the most current safety data, we provide recommendations that cover all JAKi.",Alexis A; Aoki V; Bissonnette R; Blauvelt A; Chovatiya R; Cork MJ; Danby SG; Eichenfield LF; Eyerich K; Gooderham M; Guttman-Yassky E; Hijnen DJ; Irvine AD; Katoh N; Murrell DF; Leshem YA; Levin AA; Vittrup I; Olydam JI; Orfali RL; Paller AS; Renert-Yuval Y; Rosmarin D; Silverberg JI; Thyssen JP; Ständer S; Stefanovic N; Todd G; Yu J,,

Lebrikizumab is a selective interleukin-13 inhibitor approved in the European Union, United Kingdom, United Arab Emirates, Canada, and Japan for treatment of moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis in adults and adolescents. Here, we assess the magnitude of changes across signs and symptoms of atopic dermatitis with lebrikizumab monotherapy over the 16-week induction period in two phase 3 studies, ADvocate1 and ADvocate2. Eligible adults (aged ≥ 18 years) and adolescents (aged 12 to < 18 years and weighing ≥ 40 kg) with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis were randomized to receive either 250 mg of lebrikizumab or placebo subcutaneously every two weeks. Least squares mean percentage change from baseline through week 16 was compared between lebrikizumab and placebo using mixed model repeated measure analysis for the following endpoints: Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI), Pruritus Numeric Rating Scale (NRS), Sleep-Loss Scale, Patient-Oriented Eczema Measure (POEM), and Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI). In both trials, significant (P < 0.05) improvements were observed for lebrikizumab treatment compared with placebo at each 2-week timepoint for EASI, Pruritus NRS, Sleep-Loss Scale, and POEM, and at each 4-week timepoint for DLQI, through week 16. Statistically significant (P < 0.001) improvements were observed at 16 weeks for lebrikizumab treatment versus placebo in ADvocate1/ADvocate2 for EASI (71.9%/75.0% vs. 35.6%/43.3%), Pruritus NRS (53.3%/46.3% vs. 21.4%/18.0%), Sleep-Loss Scale (57.7%/55.6% vs. 23.9%/25.5%), POEM (54.4%/45.8% vs. 18.8%/16.9%), and DLQI (64.2%/60.5% vs. 28.5%/32.2%).

The European DEVANI (Design of a Vaccine Against Neonatal Infections) program assessed the neonatal GBS infection burden in Europe, the clinical characteristics of colonized women and microbiological data of GBS strains in colonized women and their infants with early-onset disease (EOD). Overall, 1083 pregnant women with a GBS-positive culture result from eight European countries were included in the study. Clinical obstetrical information was collected by a standardized questionnaire. GBS strains were characterized by serological and molecular methods. Among GBS carriers included in this study after testing positive for GBS by vaginal or recto-vaginal sampling, 13.4% had at least one additional obstetrical risk factor for EOD.

Here, artificial linear 9-mer human leucocyte antigen (HLA)-restricted UC peptides were designed based on the well-conserved S2 region of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein regardless of rapid mutation and glycosylation hindrance. The UC peptides were characterized for its effect on immune molecules and cells by HLA-tetramer refolding assay for HLA-binding ability, by HLA-tetramer specific T cell assay for engaged cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) involvement, by HLA-dextramer T cell assay for B cell activation, by intracellular cytokine release assay for polarization of immune response, Th1 or Th2. The specific lysis activity assay of T cells was performed for direct activation of cytotoxic T lymphocytes by UC peptides. Mice were immunized for immunogenicity of UC peptides in vivo and immunized sera was assay for complement cytotoxicity assay. Results appeared that through the engagement of UC peptides and immune molecules, HLA-I and II, that CTLs elicited cytotoxic activity by recognizing SARS-CoV-2 spike-bearing cells and preferably secreting Th1 cytokines. The UC peptides also showed immunogenicity and generated a specific antibody in mice by both intramuscular injection and oral delivery without adjuvant formulation. In conclusion, a T-cell vaccine could provide long-lasting protection against SARS-CoV-2 either during reinfection or during SARS-CoV-2 rebound.

Current clinical care is palliative at the most and there remains huge unmet medical need to fully address the core symptoms of ASD. Human umbilical cord-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hUC-MSCs) are emerging as a promising candidate for ASD treatment, but the precise mechanism remains controversial. In vitro studies we performed the transwell migration assay to explore the interaction between hUC-MSCs and the primary-cultured cortical neurons. Then we determined the therapeutic effects of intravenous administration of hUC-MSCs in rats challenged with valproic acid (VPA) during gestation, a well-defined rat model of autism. Our studies showed that hUC-MSCs promoted the growth of primary-cultured cortical neurons. Furthermore, our results demonstrated that hUC-MSCs significantly alleviated microglial activation in the brain, especially in the anterior cingulate cortex, and effectively improved the sociability of the VPA-exposed rats. These results offer valuable insights for clinical translation and further research on the mechanisms of hUC-MSCs in psychiatric disorders characterized by microglial activation, particularly in cases of autism, shall be warranted.",,,

We hypothesized that psychiatric disorders would display cell type-specific transcriptional alterations in neuronal subpopulations that make up cortical microcircuits: excitatory pyramidal (PYR) neurons and vasoactive intestinal peptide- (VIP), somatostatin- (SST), and parvalbumin- (PVALB) expressing inhibitory interneurons. Using laser capture microdissection followed by RNA sequencing (LCM-seq), we performed cell type-specific molecular profiling of subgenual anterior cingulate cortex, a region implicated in mood and cognitive control. We sequenced libraries from 130 whole cells pooled per neuronal subtype (VIP, SST, PVALB, superficial and deep PYR) in 76 subjects from the University of Pittsburgh Brain Tissue Donation Program, evenly split between MDD, BD and SCZ subjects and healthy controls (totaling 380 bulk transcriptomes from ~50,000 neurons). We identified hundreds of differentially expressed (DE) genes and biological pathways across disorders and neuronal subtypes, with the vast majority in interneurons, particularly PVALB. While DE genes were unique to each cell type, there was a partial overlap across disorders for genes involved in the formation and maintenance of neuronal circuits. We observed coordinated alterations in biological pathways between select pairs of microcircuit cell types, also partially shared across disorders. Finally, DE genes coincided with known risk variants from psychiatric genome-wide association studies, suggesting cell type-specific convergence between genetic and transcriptomic risk for psychiatric disorders. Our study suggests transdiagnostic cortical microcircuit pathology in SCZ, BD, and MDD and sets the stage for larger-scale studies investigating how cell circuit-based changes contribute to shared psychiatric risk.",Arbabi K; Davie MC; Wainberg M; Tripathy SJ,The Krembil Centre for Neuroinformatics,Etienne.Sibille@camh.ca.

Epidemiology, clinical phenotype and response to therapies for gastrointestinal and liver diseases are commonly different between women and men due to sex-specific hormonal, genetic and immune-related factors. The hepatic immune system has unique regulatory functions that promote the induction of intrahepatic tolerance, which is key for maintaining liver health and homeostasis. In liver diseases, hepatic immune alterations are increasingly recognized as a main cofactor responsible for the development and progression of chronic liver injury and fibrosis. In this Review, we discuss the basic mechanisms of sex disparity in hepatic immune regulation and how these mechanisms influence and modify the development of autoimmune liver diseases, genetic liver diseases, portal hypertension and inflammation in chronic liver disease. Alterations in gut microbiota and their crosstalk with the hepatic immune system might affect the progression of liver disease in a sex-specific manner, creating potential opportunities for novel diagnostic and therapeutic approaches to be evaluated in clinical trials. Finally, we identify and propose areas for future basic, translational and clinical research that will advance our understanding of sex disparities in hepatic immunity and liver disease.",Tacke F,Department of Hepatology and Gastroenterology,burra@unipd.it.

Targeting neuroblastoma with immunotherapies has proven challenging due to a paucity of immune cells in the tumor microenvironment and the release of immunosuppressive cytokines by neuroblastoma tumor cells. We hypothesized that combining an oncolytic Herpes Simplex Virus (oHSV) with natural killer (NK) cells might overcome these barriers and incite tumor cell death. We utilized MYCN amplified and non-amplified neuroblastoma cell lines, the IL-12 expressing oHSV, M002, and the human NK cell line, NK-92 MI. We assessed the cytotoxicity of NK cells against neuroblastoma with and without M002 infection, the effects of M002 on NK cell priming, and the impact of M002 and priming on the migratory capacity and CD107a expression of NK cells. To test clinical applicability, we then investigated the effects of M002 and NK cells on neuroblastoma in vivo. NK cells were more attracted to neuroblastoma cells that were infected with M002. There was an increase in neuroblastoma cell death with the combination treatment of M002 and NK cells both in vitro and in vivo. Priming the NK cells enhanced their cytotoxicity, migratory capacity and CD107a expression. To the best of our knowledge, these investigations are the first to demonstrate the effects of an oncolytic virus combined with self-maintaining NK cells in neuroblastoma and the priming effect of neuroblastoma on NK cells. The current studies provide a deeper understanding of the relation between NK cells and neuroblastoma and these data suggest that oHSV increases NK cell cytotoxicity towards neuroblastoma.",,,elizabeth.beierle@childrensal.org.

Here we used normative modeling to track individuals' disease progression in people with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and patients with AD. Cortical and subcortical normative models were generated using healthy controls (n ≈ 58k). These models were used to calculate regional z scores in 3233 T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging time-series scans from 1181 participants. Regions with z scores < -1.96 were classified as outliers mapped on the brain and summarized by total outlier count (tOC). tOC increased in AD and in people with MCI who converted to AD and also correlated with multiple non-imaging markers. Moreover, a higher annual rate of change in tOC increased the risk of progression from MCI to AD. Brain outlier maps identified the hippocampus as having the highest rate of change. Individual patients' atrophy rates can be tracked by using regional outlier maps and tOC. Neuroanatomical normative modeling was applied to serial Alzheimer's disease (AD) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data for the first time. Deviation from the norm (outliers) of cortical thickness or brain volume was computed in 3233 scans. The number of brain-structure outliers increased over time in people with AD.

Subsequent therapy costs were incurred after disease progression; terminal care costs were considered upon death events. Outcomes included total cost per treated patient, total cost per complete responder, and cost per month in PFS between cilta-cel and SOC. Costs were adjusted to 2024 US dollars. Total cost per treated patient, total cost per complete responder, and total cost per month in PFS were estimated at $704,641, $963,941, and $30,978 for cilta-cel, respectively, and $840,730, $3,856,559, and $42,520 for SOC over the 25.4-month period.

This study sought to examine relations between triglyceride levels and the effect of alirocumab vs placebo on cardiovascular outcomes using prespecified and post hoc analyses of the ODYSSEY OUTCOMES (Evaluation of Cardiovascular Outcomes After an Acute Coronary Syndrome During Treatment With Alirocumab) trial. Patients with recent acute coronary syndrome (ACS) (n = 18,924) and elevated atherogenic lipoproteins despite optimized statin therapy were randomized to alirocumab 75 to 150 mg or matching placebo every 2 weeks subcutaneously. Major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) were examined in relation to continuous or dichotomous triglyceride concentrations. Median baseline triglyceride concentration was 129 mg/dL. In both treatment groups, a 10-mg/dL higher baseline concentration was associated with an adjusted MACE HR of 1.008 (95% CI: 1.003-1.013; P < 0.005). Baseline triglycerides ≥150 vs <150 mg/dL were associated with a HR of 1.184 (95% CI: 1.080-1.297; P < 0.005). Versus placebo, alirocumab reduced low-density lipoprotein cholesterol from baseline (average, 54.7%) and reduced MACE (HR: 0.85; 95% CI: 0.78-0.93). At month 4, triglyceride levels were reduced from baseline by median 17.7 mg/dL (P < 0.001) and 0.9 mg/dL (P = NS) with alirocumab and placebo, respectively.

In the AEGIS-II trial, CSL112, a human apolipoprotein A-I derived from plasma that enhances cholesterol efflux, did not significantly reduce the first occurrence of CV death, myocardial infarction (MI), or stroke through 90 days compared with placebo. However, an analysis involving only the first event may not capture the totality of the clinical impact of an intervention because patients may experience multiple events. This prespecified exploratory analysis examines the effect of CSL112 on total burden of nonfatal ischemic events (ie, recurrent MI and stroke) and CV death. A total of 18,219 patients with AMI, multivessel coronary artery disease, and additional CV risk factors were randomized to either 4 weekly infusions of 6 g CSL112 (n = 9,112) or matching placebo (n = 9,107). A negative binomial regression model was applied to estimate the effect of CSL112 compared with placebo on the rate ratio (RR) of ischemic events. For CV death, MI, and stroke, there were numerically fewer total events at 90 days (503 vs 545 events; rate ratio [RR]: 0.88; 95% CI: 0.76-1.03, P = 0.11), and nominally significantly fewer total events at 180 days (745 vs 821 events, RR: 0.87; 95% CI: 0.77-0.99; P = 0.04) and 365 days (1,120 vs 1,211 events; RR: 0.89; 95% CI: 0.80-0.99; P = 0.04). Subsequent events constituted 13% of events at 90 days, 17% at 180 days, and 22% at 1 year. Similar findings were seen with the total occurrence of nonfatal MI and CV death. When type II MIs, unlikely to be modified by enhancing cholesterol efflux, were excluded, there were nominally significant reductions in the total occurrence of nonfatal MI (excluding type 2) and CV death at all time points (90 days: RR: 0.81; 95% CI: 0.68-0.97; P = 0.02; 180 days: RR: 0.82; 95% CI: 0.71-0.95; P < 0.01; 365 days: RR: 0.86; 95% CI: 0.76-0.98; P = 0.02). In this prespecified exploratory analysis of the AEGIS-II trial, 4 weekly infusions of CSL112 among high-risk patients after AMI significantly reduced the total burden of nonfatal ischemic events and CV death at 180 and 365 days compared with placebo.

39227896,Immune response caused by M1 macrophages elicits atrial fibrillation-like phenotypes in coculture model with isogenic hiPSC-derived cardiomyocytes.,2024-09-04,Stem cell research & therapy,10.1186/s13287-024-03814-0,"Atrial fibrillation has an estimated prevalence of 1.5-2%, making it the most common cardiac arrhythmia. The processes that cause and sustain the disease are still not completely understood. An association between atrial fibrillation and systemic, as well as local, inflammatory processes has been reported. However, the exact mechanisms underlying this association have not been established. While it is understood that inflammatory macrophages can influence cardiac electrophysiology, a direct, causative relationship to atrial fibrillation has not been described. This study investigated the pro-arrhythmic effects of activated M1 macrophages on human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived atrial cardiomyocytes, to propose a mechanistic link between inflammation and atrial fibrillation. Two hiPSC lines from healthy individuals were differentiated to atrial cardiomyocytes and M1 macrophages and integrated in an isogenic, pacing-free, atrial fibrillation-like coculture model. Electrophysiology characteristics of cocultures were analysed for beat rate irregularity, electrogram amplitude and conduction velocity using multi electrode arrays. Cocultures were additionally treated using glucocorticoids to suppress M1 inflammation. Bulk RNA sequencing was performed on coculture-isolated atrial cardiomyocytes and compared to meta-analyses of atrial fibrillation patient transcriptomes. Multi electrode array recordings revealed M1 to cause irregular beating and reduced electrogram amplitude. Conduction analysis further showed significantly lowered conduction homogeneity in M1 cocultures. Transcriptome sequencing revealed reduced expression of key cardiac genes such as SCN5A, KCNA5, ATP1A1, and GJA5 in the atrial cardiomyocytes. Meta-analysis of atrial fibrillation patient transcriptomes showed high correlation to the in vitro model. Treatment of the coculture with glucocorticoids showed reversal of phenotypes, including reduced beat irregularity, improved conduction, and reversed RNA expression profiles. This study establishes a causal relationship between M1 activation and the development of subsequent atrial arrhythmia, documented as irregularity in spontaneous electrical activation in atrial cardiomyocytes cocultured with activated macrophages. Further, beat rate irregularity could be alleviated using glucocorticoids. Overall, these results point at macrophage-mediated inflammation as a potential AF induction mechanism and offer new targets for therapeutic development. The findings strongly support the relevance of the proposed hiPSC-derived coculture model and present it as a first of its kind disease model.",Hutschalik T; Casini M; Szabó B; Bártulos Ó; Argenziano M; Matsa E,Ncardia Services B.V; Regenerative Medicine and Heart Transplantation Unit,ematsa@ucc.ie.

A systematic review and individual patient data (IPD)-level meta-analysis of randomised trials with centrally adjudicated endpoints was performed to evaluate the comparative efficacy and safety of ticagrelor monotherapy (90 mg twice a day) after short-term DAPT (from 2 weeks to 3 months) versus 12-month DAPT in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention with a coronary drug-eluting stent.

39224695,Tumor-Homing Antibody-Cytokine Fusions for Cancer Therapy.,,OncoTargets and therapy,10.2147/OTT.S480787,"Recombinant cytokine products have emerged as a promising avenue in cancer therapy due to their capacity to modulate and enhance the immune response against tumors. However, their clinical application is significantly hindered by systemic toxicities already at low doses, thus preventing escalation to therapeutically active regimens. One promising approach to overcoming these limitations is using antibody-cytokine fusion proteins (also called immunocytokines). These biopharmaceuticals leverage the targeting specificity of antibodies to deliver cytokines directly to the tumor microenvironment, thereby reducing systemic exposure and enhancing the therapeutic index. This review comprehensively examines the development and potential of antibody-cytokine fusion proteins in cancer therapy. It explores the molecular characteristics that influence the performance of these fusion proteins, and it highlights key findings from preclinical and clinical studies, illustrating the potential of immunocytokines to improve treatment outcomes in cancer patients. Recent advancements in the field, such as novel engineering strategies and combination strategies to enhance the efficacy and safety of immunocytokines, are also discussed. These innovations offer new opportunities to optimize this class of biotherapeutics, making them a more viable and effective option for cancer treatment. As the field continues to evolve, understanding the critical factors that influence the performance of immunocytokines will be essential for successfully translating these therapies into clinical practice.",Prodi E; Neri D; De Luca R,Philogen Spa; Philochem AG,

Melanoma cells transition between well-defined transcriptional cell states that impact treatment response and resistance. In this study, we applied single-cell RNA sequencing to interrogate the molecular features of immunotherapy-naive and immunotherapy-resistant melanoma tumours in response to ex vivo BRAF/MEK inhibitor treatment. We confirm the presence of four distinct melanoma cell states - melanocytic, transitory, neural-crest like and undifferentiated, and identify enrichment of neural crest-like and undifferentiated melanoma cells in immunotherapy-resistant tumours. Furthermore, we introduce an integrated computational approach to identify subsets of responding and nonresponding melanoma cells within the transcriptional cell states. Nonresponding melanoma cells are identified in all transcriptional cell states and are predisposed to BRAF/MEK inhibitor resistance due to pro-inflammatory IL6 and TNFɑ signalling. Our study provides a framework to study treatment response within distinct melanoma cell states and indicate that tumour-intrinsic pro-inflammatory signalling contributes to BRAF/MEK inhibitor resistance.

Oncology,10.1016/S1470-2045(24)00373-5,"CAPItello-291 is an ongoing phase 3 trial in which capivasertib-fulvestrant significantly improved progression-free survival versus placebo-fulvestrant in patients with hormone receptor-positive, HER2-negative advanced breast cancer who had relapse or disease progression during or after aromatase inhibitor treatment, in both the overall population and in patients with PIK3CA, AKT1, or PTEN-altered tumours. This study further explored patient-reported health-related quality of life (HRQOL), functioning, symptoms, and symptom tolerability in CAPItello-291. This phase 3, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, which was conducted across 193 hospitals and cancer centres in 19 countries, enrolled women with any menopausal status or men, aged ≥18 years (≥20 years in Japan), with hormone receptor-positive, HER2-negative locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer who had relapse or disease progression during or after treatment with an aromatase inhibitor, with or without previous cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) 4 or 6 inhibitor therapy. Patients had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group/WHO performance score of 0 or 1 and could have received up to two previous lines of endocrine therapy and up to one previous line of chemotherapy for advanced disease. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) using block randomisation (stratified according to the presence or absence of liver metastases, previous use of a CDK4/6 inhibitor [yes vs no], and geographical region) to receive oral capivasertib 400 mg (twice daily for 4 days, followed by 3 days off) plus intramuscular fulvestrant 500 mg (every 14 days for the first three injections, then every 28 days) or placebo with matching fulvestrant dosing. The dual primary endpoint of the trial was investigator-assessed progression-free survival assessed both in the overall population and among patients with PIK3CA, AKT1, or PTEN-altered tumours. The EORTC Quality of Life Questionnaire 30-item core module (QLQ-C30) and breast module (QLQ-BR23), Patient-Reported Outcomes version of the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (PRO-CTCAE), and Patient Global Impression of Treatment Tolerability (PGI-TT) questionnaires were used to assess patient-reported outcomes. Evaluation of EORTC QLQ-C30 and EORTC QLQ-BR23 were secondary endpoints and evaluation of PRO-CTCAE and PGI-TT were pre-defined exploratory endpoints, and these endpoints are the subject of analysis in this Article. Data were collected at baseline and prespecified timepoints. Patient-reported outcomes were analysed in all randomly assigned patients with an evaluable baseline assessment and at least one evaluable post-baseline assessment. Change from baseline was assessed using mixed model with repeated measures for EORTC QLQ-C30 and summarised for QLQ-BR23. Time to deterioration was described using the Kaplan-Meier method. PGI-TT and PRO-CTCAE responses were summarised at each treatment cycle. Patient-reported outcomes were not prospectively powered for statistical comparison. The trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04305496. Between June 2, 2020, and Oct 13, 2021, 901 patients were enrolled, of whom 708 patients were randomly assigned to receive capivasertib-fulvestrant (n=355) or placebo-fulvestrant (n=353). The median age of the patients was 59 years (IQR 51-67) in the capivasertib-fulvestrant group and 58 years (IQR 49-66) in the placebo-fulvestrant group. At data cutoff (Aug 15, 2022), the median duration of follow-up for progression-free survival in censored patients was 13·0 months (IQR 9·1-16·7) for capivasertib-fulvestrant and 12·7 months (IQR 2·0-16·4) for placebo-fulvestrant in the overall population. EORTC QLQ-C30 global health status/quality of life (GHS/QOL) scores were maintained from baseline and were similar between treatment groups throughout the study period (difference in mean change from baseline of -2·5 [95% CI -4·5 to -0·6] with capivasertib-fulvestrant vs -5·6 [-7·9 to -3·4] with placebo-fulvestrant; treatment difference 3·1 [95% CI 0·2 to 6·0]). Median time to deterioration in EORTC QLQ-C30 GHS/QOL was 24·9 months (95% CI 13·8 to not reached) in the capivasertib-fulvestrant group and 12·0 months (10·2 to 15·7) in the placebo-fulvestrant group (hazard ratio [HR] 0·70, 95% CI 0·53 to 0·92). Time to deterioration HRs for all EORTC QLQ-C30 and QLQ-BR23 subscale scores showed little difference between the treatment groups, except for diarrhoea, which was worse in the capivasertib-fulvestrant group than in the placebo-fulvestrant group (HR 2·75, 95% CI 2·01-3·81). In PRO-CTCAE symptom assessment, the proportion of patients reporting loose and watery stools ""frequently"" or ""almost constantly"" was 29% higher at cycle 1, day 15 in the capivasertib-fulvestrant group than in the placebo-fulvestrant group, decreasing at subsequent cycles. Other PRO-CTCAE-reported symptoms (rash, mouth or throat sores, itchy skin, and numbness or tingling in hands or feet) were absent or mild in most patients in both groups throughout treatment. According to the PGI-TT, most patients in both groups reported ""not at all"" or ""a little bit"" of bother from treatment side-effects. Patient-reported outcomes from CAPItello-291 demonstrated that capivasertib-fulvestrant delayed time to deterioration of GHS/QOL and maintained other dimensions of HRQOL (except symptoms of diarrhoea) similarly to fulvestrant. With the clinical efficacy and manageable safety profile, these exploratory results further support the positive benefit-risk profile of capivasertib-fulvestrant in this population.

Furthermore, ferret antisera against these Manuf-C viruses recognized ≥95% of the viruses circulating during the relevant influenza season with HI or VN titres greater than one-quarter of the homologous virus titres. No cell line-specific amino acid substitutions were observed in the resulting viruses. However, polymorphisms at positions 158/160 of H3HA, 148/151 of N2NA and 197/199 of B/Victoria HA were occasionally detected in the qMDCK-C and Manuf-C viruses but barely affected the viral antigenicity. These results indicated that qMDCK-Cs are suitable for isolating influenza viruses that can serve as a source of antigenically appropriate vaccine viruses. The use of the qMDCK-C isolates will eliminates the need for clinical sample collection, virus isolation, and antigenicity analysis every season, and is expected to contribute to the promotion of vaccine virus development using manufacturer cells.",Fujimoto T; Horikoshi F; Chida S; Tanaka K; Minari K; Tanimoto Y,BIKEN CO.; Daiichi Sankyo Biotech Co.; Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited,nobusawa@niid.go.jp.

However, the stimuli responsible remain largely unknown. Recent works have focused on stromal cells, the main steady-state cellular component in tissue, as they produce pro-inflammatory chemokines that contribute to the treatment-resistant nature of IBD. We studied the regulation of these processes by examining the communication patterns between stromal and myeloid cells in ileal Crohn's disease (CD) using a complete single-cell whole tissue sequencing analysis pipeline and in vitro experimentation in mesenchymal cells. We report expansion of S4 stromal cells and monocyte-like inflammatory macrophages in the inflamed mucosa and describe interactions that may establish sustained local inflammation. These include expression of CCL2 by S1 fibroblasts to recruit and retain monocytes and macrophages in the mucosa, where they receive signals for proliferation, survival, and differentiation to inflammatory macrophages from S4 stromal cells through molecules such as MIF, IFNγ, and FN1. The overexpression of CCL2 in ileal CD and its stromal origin was further demonstrated in vitro by cultured mesenchymal cells and intestinal organoids in the context of an inflammatory milieu. Our findings outline an extensive cross-talk between stromal and myeloid cells, which may contribute to the onset and progression of inflammation in ileal Crohn's disease. Understanding the mechanisms underlying monocyte recruitment and polarization, as well as the role of stromal cells in sustaining inflammation, can provide new avenues for developing targeted therapies to treat IBD.",Paspaliaris V,Tithon Biotech Inc.,

The expansion of digital pathology in recent years and its potential interface with diagnostic artificial intelligence algorithms provides an opportunity to democratize access to personalized medicine. Current digital pathology workstations, however, cost thousands to hundreds of thousands of dollars. As cancer incidence rises in many low- and middle-income countries, the validation and implementation of low-cost automated diagnostic tools will be crucial to helping healthcare providers manage the growing burden of cancer. Here we describe a low-cost ($230) workstation for digital slide capture and computational analysis composed of open-source components. We analyze the predictive performance of deep learning models when they are used to evaluate pathology images captured using this open-source workstation versus images captured using common, significantly more expensive hardware. Validation studies assessed model performance on three distinct datasets and predictive models: head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HPV positive versus HPV negative), lung cancer (adenocarcinoma versus squamous cell carcinoma), and breast cancer (invasive ductal carcinoma versus invasive lobular carcinoma). When compared to traditional pathology image capture methods, low-cost digital slide capture and analysis with the open-source workstation, including the low-cost microscope device, was associated with model performance of comparable accuracy for breast, lung, and HNSCC classification. At the patient level of analysis, AUROC was 0.84 for HNSCC HPV status prediction, 1.0 for lung cancer subtype prediction, and 0.80 for breast cancer classification. Our ability to maintain model performance despite decreased image quality and low-power computational hardware demonstrates that it is feasible to massively reduce costs associated with deploying deep learning models for digital pathology applications. Improving access to cutting-edge diagnostic tools may provide an avenue for reducing disparities in cancer care between high- and low-income regions.

Menin inhibitors block this interaction, downregulate the abnormal expression of MEIS1 and other transcription factors and thereby release the differentiation block. Menin inhibitors show significant clinical efficacy against KMT2A-rearranged and NPM1-mutated acute leukemias, with promising potential to address unmet needs in various pediatric leukemia subtypes. In this collaborative initiative, pediatric and adult hematologists/oncologists, and stem cell transplant physicians have united their expertise to explore the potential of menin inhibitors in pediatric leukemia treatment internationally. Our efforts aim to provide a comprehensive clinical overview of menin inhibitors, integrating preclinical evidence and insights from ongoing global clinical trials. Additionally, we propose future international, inclusive, and efficient clinical trial designs, integrating pediatric populations in adult trials, to ensure broad access to this promising therapy for all children and adolescents with menin-dependent leukemias.",Guest E,Department of Pediatric Oncology,bcuglievan@mdanderson.org.

There are limited data describing outcomes among patients in the pre- and early post-cellular therapy period during the Omicron era when multiple antiviral therapeutics were widely available. The objective of this study is to describe COVID-19 treatment and outcomes in patients diagnosed with COVID-19 during the pre- or early post-cellular therapy period. This is a single-center retrospective cohort study of adult HCT and CART recipients diagnosed with COVID-19 in the pre- and early post-cellular therapy period who tested positive for COVID-19 at our cancer center between January 1, 2022 and March 1, 2023. Primary outcomes were 30-day COVID-19-related hospitalization and death. A secondary outcome was development of persistent COVID-19, defined by a positive SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) 31 to 90 days after COVID-19 diagnosis. Among 65 patients included, 52 (80%) received at least one COVID-19 therapeutic. The most common treatment after initial COVID-19 diagnosis was nirmatrelvir/ritonavir (29%), followed by monoclonal antibody therapy (26%) and remdesivir (11%). Of the 64 patients with at least 30 days of follow-up, 8 (12%) had at least one COVID-19-related hospitalization and one patient died, though cause of death was not due to COVID-19. Of the 8 patients hospitalized for COVID-19, one had severe disease and 7 had mild or moderate infection. Persistent COVID-19 was observed in 13/65 (20%) patients, with 4 patients requiring additional antiviral therapy. Three pre-cellular therapy patients had delays in receiving cellular therapy due to persistent COVID-19. During the Omicron era, rates of 30-day COVID-19-related hospitalization and death were relatively low in this cohort of pre- and early post-HCT and CART recipients, the majority of whom received treatment with at least one antiviral agent. Persistent COVID-19 occurred in 1 in 5 patients in the peri-cellular therapy period and led to cellular therapy treatment delays in several patients, highlighting the need for new COVID-19 treatment strategies.",,,erosen@fredhutch.org.

The cytokine vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) increases mLV diameter and numbers to increase mLV drainage, resulting in increased mLV drainage. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by low plasma and CSF levels of VEGF. To determine if non-invasive transcranial radiofrequency wave treatment (TRFT), through modulation of VEGF levels in blood and CSF, can affect removal of toxins tau and amyloid-β (Aβ) from the brain. Eight mild/moderate AD subjects were given twice-daily 1-hour TRFT sessions at home by their caregivers. Blood and CSF samples were taken at baseline and following completion of 2 months of TRFT. In plasma and/or CSF, strong baseline correlations between VEGF levels and AD markers (t-tau, p-tau, Aβ1-40, Aβ1-42) were eliminated by TRFT. This effect was primarily due to TRFT-induced increases in VEGF levels in AD subjects with low or unmeasurable ""baseline"" VEGF levels. These increased VEGF levels were associated with increased clearance/drainage of tau and Aβ from the brain, likely through VEGF's actions on mLVs. A new mechanism of TRFT is identified (facilitation of brain tau and Aβ clearance via VEGF) that is likely contributory to TRFT's reversal of cognitive impairment in AD subjects. TRFT may be particularly effective for cognitive benefit in AD subjects who have low VEGF levels.",Arendash GW,RF Longevity,

ORIC-101 is a potent and selective GR antagonist that was investigated in combination with taxane chemotherapy as an anticancer regimen preclinically and in a phase 1 clinical trial. The ability of ORIC-101 to reverse taxane resistance was assessed in cell lines and xenograft models, and a phase 1 study (NCT03928314) was conducted in patients with advanced solid tumors to determine the dose, safety, and antitumor activity of ORIC-101 with nab-paclitaxel. ORIC-101 reversed chemoprotection induced by glucocorticoids in vitro and achieved tumor regressions when combined with paclitaxel in both taxane-naïve and -resistant xenograft models. In the phase 1 study, 21 patients were treated in dose escalation and 62 patients were treated in dose expansion. All patients in dose expansion had previously progressed on a taxane-based regimen. In dose escalation, five objective responses were observed. A preplanned futility analysis in dose expansion showed a 3.2% (95% confidence interval, 0.4-11.2) objective response rate with a median progression-free survival of 2 months (95% confidence interval, 1.8-2.8) across all four cohorts, leading to study termination. Pharmacodynamic analysis of tissue and plasma showed GR pathway downregulation in most patients in cycle 1. ORIC-101 with nab-paclitaxel showed limited clinical activity in taxane-resistant solid tumors. Despite clear inhibition of GR pathway signaling, the insufficient clinical signal underscores the challenges of targeting a single resistance pathway when multiple mechanisms of resistance may be in play. Glucocorticoid receptor (GR) upregulation is a mechanism of resistance to taxane chemotherapy in preclinical cancer models. ORIC-101 is a small molecule GR inhibitor.

39173102,Framework for Multistakeholder Patient Registries in the Field of Rare Diseases: Focus on Neurogenetic Diseases.,2024-08-22,Neurology,10.1212/WNL.0000000000209743,"Progress in genetic diagnosis and orphan drug legislation has opened doors to new therapies in rare neurogenetic diseases (RNDs). Innovative therapies such as gene therapy can improve patients' quality of life but come with academic, regulatory, and financial challenges. Registries can play a pivotal role in generating evidence to tackle these, but their development requires multidisciplinary knowledge and expertise. This study aims to develop a practical framework for creating and implementing patient registries addressing common challenges and maximizing their impact on care, research, drug development, and regulatory decision making with a focus on RNDs. A comprehensive 3-step literature and qualitative research approach was used to develop the framework. A qualitative systematic literature review was conducted, extracting guidance and practices leading to the draft framework. Subsequently, we interviewed representatives of 5 established international RND registries to add learnings from hands-on experiences to the framework. Expert input on the draft framework was sought in digital multistakeholder focus groups to refine the framework. The literature search; interviews with 5 registries; and focus groups with patient representatives (n = 4), clinicians (n = 6), regulators, health technology assessment (HTA) bodies and payers (n = 7), industry representatives (n = 7), and data/information technology (IT) specialists (n = 5) informed development of the framework. It covers the interests of different stakeholders, purposes for data utilization, data aspects, IT infrastructure, governance, and financing of rare disease registries. Key principles include that data should be rapidly accessible, independent, and trustworthy. Governance should involve multiple stakeholders. In addition, data should be highly descriptive, machine-readable, and accessible through a shared infrastructure and not spread over multiple isolated repositories. Sustainable and independent financing of registries is deemed important but remains challenging because of a lack of widely supported funding models. The proposed framework will guide stakeholders in establishing or improving rare disease registries that fulfill requirements of academics and patients as well as regulators, HTA bodies, and commercial parties. There is a need for more clarity regarding quality requirements for registries in regulatory and HTA context. In addition, independent financing models for registries should be developed, as well as well-defined policies on technical uniformity in health data.",,,

Plasma samples were collected pre-neoadjuvant treatment, pre-surgery and/or six weeks post-surgery from 40 patients enrolled in the OpACIN-neo and PRADO clinical trials. Patients received two cycles of ipilimumab (anti-CTLA-4) and nivolumab (anti-PD-1) before surgery.

Positive ctDNA post-surgery (N = 4), irrespective of pre-treatment ctDNA status, was 100% predictive of recurrence (sensitivity 44%, specificity 100%). Furthermore, ctDNA cleared prior to surgery in 7/9 (78%) patients who did not recur, warranting further investigation into ctDNA-guided surgical management. Post-surgery ctDNA positivity and zero-conversion are highly predictive of recurrence, offering a window for personalised modification of adjuvant therapy.",,,helen.rizos@mq.edu.au.

To investigate loss-of-function mutations in key pigmentation genes in matched germline and AHM, as well as pigmented melanoma (PM), tumour DNA samples. Analysis of clinical and histopathological characteristics - together with whole-exome sequencing data of 34 fresh frozen primary CMs, graded according to the amount of pigmentation present - was performed. Together with germline and somatic variant analysis, 30 samples had previously been analysed for copy number aberration (CNA) changes. This study focused on germline and somatic variants in the coding region of 16 genes known to be associated with albinism/hypopigmentation or variation in human pigmentation in all samples. Chromosomal regions encompassing these 16 genes were examined for DNA copy loss or gain. The finding that red hair-related MC1R and TYR R402Q loss-of-activity gene variant alleles and genotypes are associated with AHM was confirmed. Germline AHM-related gene variants were enriched in 70% (n = 7/10) of patients with AHM vs. 8% (n = 2/24) of those with PM. This surprisingly high frequency of rare germline variants in people with AHM constitutes the 'first hit' and confirms that those with AHM are more likely to be albinism allele carriers than individuals with PM. Next, in CNA analysis of each tumour sample, 50% (n = 4/8) of AHM samples with a pigmentation gene variant had loss of heterozygosity (LOH) in the region containing the corresponding gene and 25% (n = 2/8) had LOH in chromosomal regions of two AHM-related genes. This study proposes that the likely molecular mechanism for the development of amelanogenesis in AHM is carriage of an albinism/hypopigmentation allele followed by LOH of the corresponding gene in the tumour. Melanoma is a form of skin cancer. Up to 20% of melanomas are flesh-coloured tumours. Other melanomas can be coloured or ‘pigmented’. These differences present a challenge when trying to diagnose melanoma early. A type of flesh-coloured melanoma called ‘amelanotic/hypomelanotic’ melanoma (or ‘AHM’ for short) often develops with sun damage and in older people. The loss of colour, or ‘pigment’, in AHM is caused by a decrease in the amount of a substance called melanin produced in the tumour cells. We looked at possible genetic differences between AHM and pigmented melanoma. We examined changes in key genes associated with decreases in skin colouring or gene mutations that cause albinism (where no melanin is produced). We found variants in genes that cause albinism or reduced pigmentation in 7 of 10 people with AHM. Only 2 of 24 people with pigmented melanoma had these genetic variants. Overall, the high frequency of gene variants in people with AHM, together with a loss of gene function in the tumour, supports the idea that some people could be predisposed to getting AHM. This provides an explanation for the loss of melanin in AHM tumours.",McArthur GA,Cancer Research Division,

Specifically, the vaginal microbiota of ruminants is attracting growing interest, due to its predicted critical role on cows' reproductive functions in livestock contexts. Notably, fertility disorders represent a leading cause for culling, and additional research would help to fill relevant knowledge gaps. In the present study, we aimed to characterize the vaginal microbiota of a large cohort of 1171 female dairy cattle from 19 commercial herds in Northern France. Vaginal samples were collected using a swab and the composition of the microbiota was determined through 16S rRNA sequencing targeting the V3-V4 hypervariable regions. Initial analyses allowed us to define the core bacterial vaginal microbiota, comprising all the taxa observed in more than 90% of the animals. Consequently, four phyla, 16 families, 14 genera and a single amplicon sequence variant (ASV) met the criteria, suggesting a high diversity of bacterial vaginal microbiota within the studied population. This variability was partially attributed to various environmental factors such as the herd, sampling season, parity, and lactation stage. Next, we identified numerous significant associations between the diversity and composition of the vaginal microbiota and several traits related to host's production and reproduction performance, as well as reproductive tract health. Specifically, 169 genera were associated with at least one trait, with 69% of them significantly associated with multiple traits. Among these, the abundances of Negativibacillus and Ruminobacter were positively correlated with the cows' performances (i.e., longevity, production performances). Other genera showed mixed relationships with the phenotypes, such as Leptotrichia being overabundant in cows with improved fertility records and reproductive tract health, but also in cows with lower production levels. Overall, the numerous associations underscored the complex interactions between the vaginal microbiota and its host. Given the large number of samples collected from commercial farms and the diversity of the phenotypes considered, this study marks an initial step towards a better understanding of the intimate relationship between the vaginal microbiota and the dairy cow's phenotypes.",Brulin L; Ducrocq S; Even G; Sanchez MP; Martel S; Merlin S; Audebert C; Croiseau P; Estellé J,GD Biotech-Gènes Diffusion; Université Paris-Saclay,l.brulin@genesdiffusion.com.

Obinutuzumab may be a superior combination partner with lenalidomide given enhanced antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity and phagocytosis compared to rituximab. Our aim was to determine the recommended phase 2 dose, safety, and activity of lenalidomide in combination with fixed dose of obinutuzumab in relapsed and refractory indolent B cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma. In this single-arm, open-label, phase 1/2 trial, we enrolled patients with relapsed or refractory WHO Grade 1-3A follicular lymphoma, marginal zone lymphoma and small lymphocytic lymphoma and adequate performance status (ECOG 0-2) at the MD Anderson Cancer Center. We excluded patients with evidence of ongoing transformation to aggressive lymphoma. During phase 1, 1000 mg intravenous obinutuzumab was administered with three predefined levels of oral lenalidomide in a 3 + 3 dose escalation design to establish lenalidomide 20 mg as the recommended phase 2 dose. During phase 2, patients received induction therapy with six 28-day cycles of lenalidomide 20 mg with intravenous obinutuzumab 1000 mg. In accordance with our prior experience with lenalidomide plus rituximab, patients who were responding to the combination could receive up to 6 additional cycles (up to 12 cycles in total) of combination therapy. Dosing of obinutuzumab was continued in all responding patients after cycle 6 every 2 months for a total of 30 months from the start of therapy. The decision of number of cycles of combination therapy beyond 6 was at discretion of the investigator and was included to allow individualisation of therapy to maximise response while minimising exposure. The co-primary objectives were to evaluate the safety and overall response, defined as the proportion of patients who achieved a complete or partial response in relapsed and refractory indolent non-Hodgkin lymphoma at the end of induction therapy, according to Cheson and colleagues (2007 criteria). The secondary endpoints were complete response after induction therapy and time to event endpoints including time to progression, progression free survival, and overall survival. Analyses were intent to treat in the efficacy cohort and per-treated in the safety population in all patients who received at least one dose of either investigational agent. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01995669. Between June 03, 2014, and 07 March 2019, we completed planned enrolment, and 66 patients started therapy including 9 patients in phase 1 and 57 patients in phase 2. All patients were evaluated for safety and the 60 patients treated at the recommended phase 2 dose of lenalidomide 20 mg were evaluable for activity. Grade 3-4 haematological toxicities included neutropenia 21% (14/66) and thrombocytopenia 11% (7/66) with no cases of febrile neutropenia. Grade 3-4 non-haematological toxicities included lung infection 8% (5/66), fatigue 8% (5/66) and rash 6% (4/66). By Cheson 2007 criteria, 90% (54/60, 95% CI: 79-96) achieved an overall response at the end of induction meeting the prespecified activity endpoint. Complete responses were seen in 33% (20/60, 95% CI: 22-47) at the end of induction. Median progression free survival, time to progression and overall survival have not been reached after median follow-up of 41.7 months. Estimated 4-year progression free survival rates were 55% (95% CI: 42-73), time to progression of 56% (95% CI: 43-74) and overall survival of 84% (95% CI: 74-95). Our findings suggest that oral lenalidomide with obinutuzumab is safe and highly active in patients with relapsed and refractory indolent B cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma and is associated with prolonged remission duration. The study is limited by the lack of a control arm leading to cross-trial comparisons to evaluate activity. Future randomised trials comparing this regime to rituximab and lenalidomide are warranted.

At a high level, initial allergen exposure disrupts epithelial integrity, triggering local inflammation via alarmins including IL-25, IL-33, and TSLP, which activate type 2 innate lymphoid cells as well as other immune cells to secrete type 2 cytokines IL-4, IL-5 and IL-13, promoting Th2 cell development and eosinophil recruitment. Th2 cell dependent B cell activation promotes the production of allergen-specific IgE, which stably binds to basophils and mast cells. Rapid degranulation of these cells upon allergen re-exposure leads to allergic symptoms. Recent advances in our understanding of the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying allergic pathophysiology have significantly shaped the development of therapeutic intervention strategies. In this review, we highlight key therapeutic targets within the allergic cascade with a particular focus on past, current and future treatment approaches using monoclonal antibodies. Specific targeting of alarmins, type 2 cytokines and IgE has shown varying degrees of clinical benefit in different allergic indications including asthma, chronic spontaneous urticaria, atopic dermatitis, chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps, food allergies and eosinophilic esophagitis.

Our findings demonstrate that macrophages in vascularized breast and lung tumor models can enhance monocyte recruitment via CCL7 and CCL2, mediated by CSF-1R. Additionally, a multispecific antibody targeting CSF-1R, CCR2, and neutralizing TGF-β (CSF1R/CCR2/TGF-β Ab) repolarizes TAMs towards an anti-tumoral M1-like phenotype, reduces monocyte chemoattractant protein secretion, and blocks monocyte migration. This antibody also inhibits monocyte recruitment in patient-specific vascularized tumor models.

As compared to healthy controls, subjects with current or remitted MDD presented similarly lower mean C2 levels (Cohen's d = 0.2, p ≤ 1e-4). Higher overall depression severity was significantly associated with higher C3 levels (ß=0.06, SE = 0.02, p = 1.21e-3). No associations were found for C8 and C10. Focusing on symptom profiles, only higher AES scores were linked to lower C2 (ß=-0.05, SE = 0.02, p = 1.85e-2) and higher C3 (ß=0.08, SE = 0.02, p = 3.41e-5) levels. Results were confirmed in analyses pooling data with an additional internal replication sample from the same subjects measured at 6-year follow-up (totaling 4141 observations). Small alterations in levels of short-chain acylcarnitine levels were related to the presence and severity of depression, especially for symptoms reflecting altered energy homeostasis.

39148958,The Role of Coenzyme Q10 in Skin Aging and Opportunities for Topical Intervention: A Review.,,The Journal of clinical and aesthetic dermatology,,"Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) is a naturally produced, lipid-soluble molecule crucial for cellular energy production and antioxidant activity. It diminishes with age and under external stress factors in skin, leading to signs of aging. Beyond its role in cellular energy production within the mitochondria, CoQ10 is vital to skin's defense against oxidative stress, a key contributor to premature aging. Use of topical skincare products with CoQ10 can be effective to replenish levels of CoQ10 and reverse skin aging. This publication discusses the role of CoQ10 in skin aging along with the benefits of topical skincare products that incorporate CoQ10 as an ingredient. We searched the PubMed database using terms ""Coenzyme Q10"" and ""skin"" and ""aging."" Overall, the search yielded 80 results, but a limitation of 10 years was then applied to restrict publications to those with the most up-to-date science. A total of 36 publications were identified and included as background for this article. These 36 publications encompassed both original research articles and review articles. Applying topical skincare products with CoQ10 replenishes CoQ10 cellular levels, helping to normalize cellular energy homeostasis and providing antioxidative effects to support and repair cutaneous damage including signs of skin aging. In  Aging and stressed skin are, in part, the result of alterations in cellular metabolic homeostasis, which can be reversed via the benefits of topical application of CoQ10-enriched formulations that stimulate cutaneous energy metabolism and reduce free radicals via antioxidant function. By restoring physiological homeostasis, topical skincare products with CoQ10 replenish the skin's antioxidant levels, increase cellular (energy) metabolism, and reduce the signs of skin aging.",Lain ET; Agrawal N; Ruvolo E; Weise JM,Dr. Weise is with Beiersdorf AG; Messrs.

Oncology,10.1016/S1470-2045(24)00338-3,"In the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) 1325-MG/KEYNOTE-054 study, adjuvant pembrolizumab improved recurrence-free survival and distant-metastasis-free survival in patients with resected stage III melanoma. Earlier results showed no effect of pembrolizumab on health-related quality of life (HRQOL). Little is known about HRQOL after completion of treatment with pembrolizumab, an important research area concerning patients who are likely to become long-term survivors. This study reports long-term HRQOL results. This double-blind, randomised, controlled, phase 3 trial compared adjuvant pembrolizumab with placebo in patients aged 18 years or older with previously untreated stage IIIA, IIIB, or IIIC resected cutaneous melanoma and an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status score of 1 or 0, recruited from 123 academic centres and community hospitals in 23 countries. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) with a minimisation technique stratified for stage and geographical region to receive 200 mg of intravenous pembrolizumab or placebo every 3 weeks for up to 18 doses. Investigators, patients, and those collecting or analysing data were masked to group assignment. The primary endpoint of the trial was recurrence-free survival (reported elsewhere). HRQOL was a prespecified exploratory endpoint, measured with the EORTC Quality of Life Questionnaire-Core 30. All patients with a baseline HRQOL evaluation available who were alive 108 weeks from randomisation were included in this analysis of long-term HRQOL. Long-term HRQOL included assessments measured every 6 months between 108 weeks and 48 months after randomisation. The threshold of clinical relevance for all HRQOL scales used was an average change of 5 points. The trial is ongoing, recruitment is completed, and HRQOL data collection is finalised. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02362594, and EudraCT, 2014-004944-37. Between Aug 26, 2015, and Nov 14, 2016, 1019 patients were randomly assigned to pembrolizumab (n=514) or placebo (n=505). Completion of the HRQOL evaluation at baseline exceeded 90% (481 [94%] patients in the pembrolizumab group and 467 [92%] in the placebo group), and ranged between 60% and 90% for post-baseline timepoints. Among patients with a baseline HRQOL evaluation, 365 (39%) were female and 583 (61%) were male. The mean change from baseline to long-term HRQOL was -0·56 (95% CI -2·33 to 1·22) in the pembrolizumab group and 1·63 (-0·12 to 3·38) in the placebo group. The difference between the two groups was -2·19 (-4·65 to 0·27, p=0·081). Differences for all other scales were smaller than 5 and not statistically significant. Adjuvant pembrolizumab did not have a significant impact on long-term HRQOL compared with placebo in patients with resected stage III melanoma. These findings, together with earlier results on efficacy and HRQOL, support the use of pembrolizumab in this setting.

Considering their significance, artificial disulfide bonds are often introduced to enhance protein thermostability. Although an increasing number of tools can assist with this task, significant amounts of time and resources are often wasted owing to inadequate consideration. To enhance the accuracy and efficiency of designing disulfide bonds for protein thermostability improvement, we initially collected disulfide bond and protein thermostability data from extensive literature sources. Thereafter, we extracted various sequence- and structure-based features and constructed machine-learning models to predict whether disulfide bonds can improve protein thermostability. Among all models, the neighborhood context model based on the Adaboost-DT algorithm performed the best, yielding ""area under the receiver operating characteristic curve"" and accuracy scores of 0.773 and 0.714, respectively. Furthermore, we also found AlphaFold2 to exhibit high superiority in predicting disulfide bonds, and to some extent, the coevolutionary relationship between residue pairs potentially guided artificial disulfide bond design. Moreover, several mutants of imine reductase 89 (IR89) with artificially designed thermostable disulfide bonds were experimentally proven to be considerably efficient for substrate catalysis.

Current research efforts are attempting to identify biomarkers and suitable combination partners to predict or further improve the activity of immune checkpoint inhibitors. Antibody-cytokine fusions are a class of pharmaceuticals that showed the potential to boost the anticancer properties of other immunotherapies. Extradomain A-fibronectin (EDA-FN), which is expressed in most solid and hematological tumors but is virtually undetectable in healthy adult tissues, is an attractive target for the delivery of cytokine at the site of the disease. In this work, we describe the generation and characterization of a novel interleukin-7-based fusion protein targeting EDA-FN termed F8(scDb)-IL7. The product consists of the F8 antibody specific to the alternatively spliced EDA of FN in the single-chain diabody (scDb) format fused to human IL-7. F8(scDb)-IL7 efficiently stimulates human peripheral blood mononuclear cells in vitro. Moreover, the product significantly increases the expression of T Cell Factor 1 (TCF-1) on CD8+T cells compared with an IL2-fusion protein. TCF-1 has emerged as a pivotal transcription factor that influences the durability and potency of immune responses against tumors. In preclinical cancer models, F8(scDb)-IL7 demonstrates potent single-agent activity and eradicates sarcoma lesions when combined with anti-PD-1. Our results provide the rationale to explore the combination of F8(scDb)-IL7 with anti-PD-1 antibodies for the treatment of patients with cancer.",Di Nitto C; Ravazza D; Gilardoni E; Prodi E; Puca E; Neri D; De Luca R,Philogen SpA; Philochem AG,roberto.deluca@philogen.com.

In this phase 1, open-label, dose-escalation study, patients received i.v. FAP-IL2v at 10 or 15/20 mg alone or 10 mg when combined with i.v. atezolizumab. The primary objectives were identification of dose-limiting toxicities (DLT), recommended dose, and maximum tolerated dose, and evaluation of the safety/tolerability and pharmacokinetics of FAP-IL2v alone and combined with atezolizumab. All 11 patients experienced adverse events (AE) during FAP-IL2v treatment. Although most AEs were of mild severity, four treatment-related AEs led to study treatment discontinuation in two patients: one with infusion-related reaction, hypotension, and capillary leak syndrome, and the other with increased aspartate aminotransferase. No AE-related deaths occurred. One DLT (grade 3 hypotension) occurred in a patient receiving FAP-IL2v 15/20 mg alone. The recommended dose and maximum tolerated dose could not be determined. The pharmacokinetics of FAP-IL2v remained similar with or without atezolizumab. The study was terminated early as FAP-IL2v development was discontinued because of portfolio prioritization (not for efficacy/safety reasons). This study describes the safety/tolerability of FAP-IL2v 10 mg alone and in combination with atezolizumab in Japanese patients with advanced solid tumors; one DLT (hypotension) occurred with FAP-IL2v 15/20 mg. However, dose escalation of FAP-IL2v was not conducted because of early study termination. This phase I study assessed the safety/tolerability and PK of simlukafusp alfa alone or combined with atezolizumab in Japanese patients with advanced solid tumors. No notable differences in PK were noted with the combination versus simlukafusp alfa alone; however, high-dose simlukafusp alfa treatment was associated with recombinant IL2-related toxicity, despite the drug's FAP targeting and IL2Rβγ-biased IL2 variant design.",Imaizumi T; Enomoto M; Seki R,Chugai Pharmaceutical Co.,

Previous evidence suggests a connection between LID and a disruption of the dopaminergic system as well as genes implicated in PD, including GBA1 and LRRK2. Our goal was to investigate the effects of genetic variants on risk and time to LID. We performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) and analyses focused on GBA1 and LRRK2 variants. We also calculated polygenic risk scores (PRS) including risk variants for PD and variants in genes involved in the dopaminergic transmission pathway. To test the influence of genetics on LID risk we used logistic regression, and to examine its impact on time to LID we performed Cox regression including 1612 PD patients with and 3175 without LID. We found that GBA1 variants were associated with LID risk (odds ratio [OR] = 1.65; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.21-2.26; P = 0.0017) and LRRK2 variants with reduced time to LID onset (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.42; 95% CI, 1.09-1.84; P = 0.0098).

Comparison of potential for lesion formation, using in vitro models, of both primary endometrial and mesothelial cells from patients with endometriosis and control patients, establishing the former as the primary disease driver. When comparing mesothelial cells from control patients with those from patients with endometriosis, there was no significant difference in the amount of stromal cell invasion across either barrier. In contrast, when comparing stromal cell origin, the amount of invasion by endometriosis stromal cells was greater than control stromal cells regardless of whether the mesothelial cell monolayer was derived from patients with the disease or control patients. Additionally, primary mesothelial cells induced more gap junction coupling, a requirement for invasion, in stromal cells from patients with endometriosis than control patients, again independent of mesothelial origin. The notable exception was mesothelial cells derived from endometriotic lesion-affected areas that showed depressed ability to support invasion. Although both endometrial and mesothelial cells need to function for establishment of endometriosis lesions, the endometrium seems to be the key player, serving as an ideal target for diagnostic strategies and therapeutic intervention.

Quality assessment through the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) and publication bias was measured. We meta-analyzed 53 different studies (schizophrenia patients: n = 2,513,359; controls: n = 360,504,484) to highlight the differential effects of antipsychotic treatment regimens on cardio-cerebrovascular-related mortality in incident and prevalent samples of patients with schizophrenia.

39120847,Effects of Adalimumab-adbm Versus Adalimumab Reference Product on Patient-Reported Outcomes in Rheumatoid Arthritis: Results from VOLTAIRE-RA.,,Rheumatology and therapy,10.1007/s40744-024-00687-w,"This post hoc analysis of VOLTAIRE-RA compared patient-reported outcomes, including health-related quality of life (HRQoL), in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) before and after treatment with biosimilar adalimumab-adbm or adalimumab reference product. HRQoL was assessed by 36-Item Short Form Survey (SF-36) Physical and Mental Component Summary (PCS and MCS, respectively) and domain scores at baseline and weeks 12/24. Results were considered clinically meaningful if improvements were greater than or equal to minimum clinically important differences (MCIDs) of 2.5 for PCS and MCS and 5.0 for domain scores. Comparisons with age- and sex-matched norms and treatment-associated changes in domain scores from baseline were quantified using spydergrams and the health utility SF-6D measure. All comparisons between treatment groups were descriptive in nature. No differences in PCS scores were reported between treatment groups at baseline or weeks 12/24. MCS scores slightly favored the reference product group at baseline, and differences in scores at weeks 12/24 generally reflected those differences. Improvements in PCS scores greater than or equal to MCID at weeks 12/24 were reported by over 65% of patients in both treatment groups, while over 56% experienced improvements in MCS scores greater than or equal to MCID at weeks 12/24. Similar proportions receiving reference product and adalimumab-adbm reported scores greater than or equal to US age- and sex-matched normative values at week 24: 14-39% versus 15-36%, respectively, compared with baseline (1-17%). In patients with moderate to severely active RA, adalimumab-adbm and adalimumab reference product were both associated with clinically meaningful improvements in SF-36 PCS, MCS, and domain scores that were highly similar at weeks 12/24. The high proportion of patients reporting scores greater than or equal to normative values in both treatment groups is notable, as this represents a treatment goal that was difficult to achieve in earlier RA trials.

Changes in fungal communities (mycobiome), an integral component of the gut microbiome, are associated with and contribute to the development of liver disease. Fungal dysbiosis can induce intestinal barrier dysfunction and allow fungal products to translocate to the liver causing progression of disease. This review explores recent progress in understanding the compositional and functional diversity of gut mycobiome signatures across different liver diseases. It delves into causative connections between gut fungi and liver diseases. We emphasize the significance of fungal translocation, with a particular focus on fungal-derived metabolites and immune cells induced by fungi, as key contributors to liver disease.

Cardiology,10.1038/s41569-024-01064-4,"Substantial progress has been made in the management of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) in the past 25 years, but the disease remains life-limiting. Established therapies for PAH are mostly limited to symptomatic relief by correcting the imbalance of vasoactive factors. The tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib, the first predominantly non-vasodilatory drug to be tested in patients with PAH, improved exercise capacity and pulmonary haemodynamics compared with placebo but at the expense of adverse events such as subdural haematoma. Given that administration by inhalation might reduce the risk of systemic adverse effects, inhaled formulations of tyrosine kinase inhibitors are currently in clinical development. Other novel therapeutic approaches for PAH include suppression of activin receptor type IIA signalling with sotatercept, which has shown substantial efficacy in clinical trials and was approved for use in the USA in 2024, but the long-term safety of the drug remains unclear. Future advances in the management of PAH will focus on right ventricular function and involve deep phenotyping and the development of a personalized medicine approach. In this Review, we summarize the mechanisms underlying PAH, provide an overview of available PAH therapies and their limitations, describe the development of newer, predominantly non-vasodilatory drugs that are currently being tested in phase II or III clinical trials, and discuss future directions for PAH research.",,,ardeschir.ghofrani@innere.med.uni-giessen.de.

Molecular characterization, that is, by next-generation sequencing (NGS), is needed to identify potential targets. Lung Cancer Master Protocol Southwest Oncology Group S1400 enrolled patients with previously treated stage IV or recurrent SqCC to assess NGS biomarkers for therapeutic sub-studies. Tumors underwent NGS using Foundation Medicine's FoundationOne research platform, which sequenced the exons and/or introns of 313 cancer-related genes. Mutually exclusive gene set analysis and Selected Events Linked by Evolutionary Conditions across Human Tumors were performed to identify mutually exclusive and co-occurring gene alterations. Comparisons were performed with data on 495 lung SqCC downloaded from The Cancer Genome Atlas. Cox proportional hazards models were used to assess associations between genetic variants and survival. NGS data are reported for 1672 patients enrolled on S1400 between 2014 and 2019. Mutually exclusive gene set analysis identified two non-overlapping sets of mutually exclusive alterations with a false discovery rate of less than 15%: NFE2L2, KEAP1, and PARP4; and CDKN2A and RB1. PARP4, a relatively uncharacterized gene, showed three frequent mutations suggesting functional significance: 3116T>C (I1039T), 3176A>G (Q1059R), and 3509C>T (T1170I). When taken together, NFE2L2 and KEAP1 alterations were associated with poorer survival. As the largest dataset to date of lung SqCC profiled on a clinical trial, the S1400 NGS dataset establishes a rich resource for biomarker discovery. Mutual exclusivity of PARP4 and NFE2L2 or KEAP1 alterations suggests that PARP4 may have an uncharacterized role in a key pathway known to impact oxidative stress response and treatment resistance.",Tolba KA,Foundation Medicine,dkozono@bwh.harvard.edu.

Schools were randomized to intervention or control group. Surveys were conducted at baseline (pre-intervention) and at 9, 16, and 24 months post-intervention via paper & pencil questionnaires. The primary outcome was the difference in within-group changes in smoking prevalence between intervention and control group at 24 months. Overall, 144 German secondary schools comprising 11,286 pupils participated in the baseline survey, of which 100 schools participated in the baseline and at least one of the follow-up surveys, yielding 7437 pupils in the analysis sample.

39110499,Chromosome structure in ,2024-08-07,eLife,10.7554/eLife.94070,"Two different models have been proposed to explain how the endpoints of chromatin looped domains ('TADs') in eukaryotic chromosomes are determined. In the first, a cohesin complex extrudes a loop until it encounters a boundary element roadblock, generating a stem-loop. In this model, boundaries are functionally autonomous: they have an intrinsic ability to halt the movement of incoming cohesin complexes that is independent of the properties of neighboring boundaries. In the second, loops are generated by boundary:boundary pairing. In this model, boundaries are functionally non-autonomous, and their ability to form a loop depends upon how well they match with their neighbors. Moreover, unlike the loop-extrusion model, pairing interactions can generate both stem-loops and circle-loops. We have used a combination of MicroC to analyze how TADs are organized, and experimental manipulations of the ",,,

Clinical haematology,10.1016/j.beha.2024.101557,"The European society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (EBMT) has a long-standing interest in the evaluation of hematopoietic cell transplantation. More than three decades ago, its members established a continental registry. Today, more than 700,000 patients have been registered, and information has been gathered on more than 800,000 transplants. This huge amount of information has allowed conducting multiple retrospective studies, evaluating changes in practices over time and for different categories of diseases, benchmarking outcome across EBMT affiliated centers, and increasingly serves to build synthetic comparators to evaluate the introduction of therapeutic innovations in the field of hematology. CAR-T cells therapies draw on human and technical resources that are also used to deliver HCT; they elicit side effects that require the implementation of risk mitigation plans; they are living drugs that persist in the body of the recipient and thus deserve prolonged follow-up; the introduction of CAR-T cells in the pharmacopeia is likely to significantly impact on the practice of BMT; for all these reasons and even before the first approvals of CAR-T Cells in Europe, EBMT engaged in a project aiming at complementing the EBMT Registry with a Cellular Therapy Form, with the objective to register CAR-T cells treated patients and collect information on their short-, middle- and long-term outcome. The goal is to provide EBMT investigators with a tool for primary analyses of the collected information and to support secondary use of data transferred at the individual level to Marketing Authorization Holders and other interested parties, to fulfill their obligations to health authorities and further evaluate the actual medical values of CAR-T Cells in different contexts and indications.

We conducted a retrospective multicenter analysis of 189 patients with relapsed/refractory ALL treated with brexu-cel. Over half of the patients received InO before brexu-cel (InO exposed). InO-exposed patients were more heavily pretreated (P = .02) and frequently had active marrow disease before apheresis (P = .03). Response rate and toxicity profile after brexu-cel were comparable for InO-exposed and InO-naïve patients; however, consolidation therapy after brexu-cel response was used at a higher rate in InO-naïve patients (P = .005). With a median follow-up of 11.4 months, InO-exposed patients had inferior progression-free survival (PFS; P = .013) and overall survival (OS; P = .006) in univariate analyses; however, prior InO exposure did not influence PFS (hazard ratio, 1.20; 95% confidence interval, 0.71-2.03) in multivariate models. Within InO-exposed patients, InO responders had superior PFS (P = .002) and OS (P < .0001) relative to InO-refractory patients. The timing of administering InO did not affect brexu-cel outcomes, with comparable PFS (P = .51) and OS (P = .86) for patients receiving InO as bridging therapy or before apheresis. In conclusion, although InO exposure was associated with inferior survival outcomes after brexu-cel in unadjusted analyses, these associations were no longer significant in multivariate analyses, suggesting it is unlikely that InO negatively affects brexu-cel efficacy. Our data instead imply that InO-exposed recipients of brexu-cel tend to be higher-risk patients with intrinsic adverse leukemia biology.",Mukherjee A; Hilal T; Leonard JT,Division of Hematology-Oncology; Department of Hematology and Oncology; Division of Hematology and Medical Oncology,

We analysed 2414 male patients (1110 included in the development cohort, 502 in the internal cohort, and 802 in the external validation cohort), among whom 901 (37%) had died as of data cutoff (June 30, 2023; median follow-up of 52·9 months [IQR 33·9-79·0]). Predictors in the quantitative PPP nomogram were locoregional lymph node metastases (molecular imaging N2), distant metastases (extrapelvic nodal metastases, bone metastases [disseminated or diffuse marrow involvement], and organ metastases), tumour volume (in L), and tumour mean standardised uptake value. Predictors in the visual PPP nomogram were distant metastases (extrapelvic nodal metastases, bone metastases [disseminated or diffuse marrow involvement], and organ metastases) and total tumour lesion count. In the internal and external validation cohorts, C-indices were 0·80 (95% CI 0·77-0·84) and 0·77 (0·75-0·78) for the quantitative nomogram, respectively, and 0·78 (0·75-0·82) and 0·77 (0·75-0·78) for the visual nomogram, respectively. In the combined development and internal validation cohort, the quantitative PPP nomogram was superior to STARCAP risk score for patients at initial staging (n=139 with available staging data; AUC 0·73 vs 0·54; p=0·018), EAU risk score at biochemical recurrence (n=412; 0·69 vs 0·52; p<0·0001), and NCCN pan-stage risk score (n=1534; 0·81 vs 0·74; p<0·0001) for the prediction of overall survival, but was similar to GAFITA nomogram for metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer (mHSPC; n=122; 0·76 vs 0·72; p=0·49) and metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC; n=270; 0·67 vs 0·75; p=0·20). The visual PPP nomogram was superior to EAU at biochemical recurrence (n=414; 0·64 vs 0·52; p=0·0004) and NCCN across all stages (n=1544; 0·79 vs 0·73; p<0·0001), but similar to STARCAP for initial staging (n=140; 0·56 vs 0·53; p=0·74) and GAFITA for mHSPC (n=122; 0·74 vs 0·72; p=0·66) and mCRPC (n=270; 0·71 vs 0·75; p=0·23). Our PPP nomograms accurately stratify high-risk and low-risk groups for overall survival in early and late stages of prostate cancer and yield equal or superior prediction accuracy compared with established clinical risk tools. Validation and improvement of the nomograms with long-term follow-up is ongoing (NCT06320223).

However, there is a lack of mentorship opportunities within CH compared with medical oncology. To address this need, a year-long external mentorship program was implemented through the American Society of Hematology Medical Educators Institute. Thirty-five hematology/oncology fellows interested in CH and 34 academically productive faculty mentors from different institutions across North America were paired in a meticulous process that considered individual interests, experiences, and background. Pairs were expected to meet virtually once a month. Participation in a scholarly project was optional. A mixed-methods sequential explanatory design was used to evaluate the program using mentee and mentor surveys, a mentee interview, and a mentee focus group. Thirty-three mentee-mentor pairs (94.2%) completed the program. Sixty-three percent of mentee respondents worked on a scholarly project with their mentor; several mentees earned publications, grants, and awards. Mentee perception that their assigned mentor was a good match was associated with a perceived positive impact on confidence (P = .0423), career development (P = .0423), and professional identity (P = .0302). Furthermore, 23 mentees (66%) accepted CH faculty positions after fellowship. All mentor respondents believed that this program would increase retention in CH. This mentorship program demonstrates a productive, beneficial way of connecting mentees and mentors from different institutions to improve the careers of CH trainees, with the ultimate goal of increasing retention in CH.",Fritz J,American Society of Hematology,

Despite commentary from politicians, and public health officials, it is unknown how xylazine impacts naloxone efficacy, and. few studies have examined it alone. Here, we examine the impact of xylazine alone and in combination with fentanyl on several behaviors in mice. Surprisingly, naloxone precipitates withdrawal from xylazine and fentanyl/xylazine coadministration, with enhanced sensitivity in females. Further, xylazine is a full agonist at kappa opioid receptors, a potential mechanism for its naloxone sensitivity. Finally, we demonstrate surprising effects of xylazine to kappa opioid antagonism, which are relevant for public health considerations.

The mechanisms of action include an increase in extracellular level of serotonin, neurogenesis, and growth of vessels in the brain. We investigated whether fluoxetine could have broader peripheral regenerative properties. Following prolonged administration of fluoxetine in male mice, we showed that fluoxetine increases the number of muscle stem cells and muscle angiogenesis, associated with positive changes in skeletal muscle function. Fluoxetine also improved skeletal muscle regeneration after single and multiples injuries with an increased muscle stem cells pool and vessel density associated with reduced fibrotic lesions and inflammation. Mice devoid of peripheral serotonin treated with fluoxetine did not exhibit beneficial effects during muscle regeneration.

Current dichotomous classification of LDL receptor gene (LDLR) variants may inadequately capture patient variability in LDL cholesterol levels and CAD risk. This study assessed a novel approach for determining LDLR variant severity using variant-specific LDL cholesterol percentiles. Participants of the Dutch FH cascade screening program were screened for 456 LDLR variants. For each LDLR variant carrier, a sex- and age-specific LDL cholesterol percentile was derived from the LDL cholesterol level measured at study entry, i.e. generally from the blood drawn for DNA analysis. These percentiles were used to calculate the mean LDL cholesterol percentile for each variant. Based on the variant-specific LDL cholesterol percentiles, carriers were grouped into the following LDL cholesterol strata: <75th, 75th-88th, 88th-92nd, 92nd-96.5th, 96.5th-98th, and ≥98th percentile. Additionally, variants were categorized into class 1 (LDLR deficient) and non-class 1 (often LDLR defective) variants. CAD risk between carriers in the different LDL cholesterol strata and non-carriers was compared using a Cox proportional hazard model. Out of 35,067 participants, 12,485 (36 %) LDLR variant carriers (mean age 38.0 ± 20.0 years, 47.7 % male) were identified. Carriers had a 5-fold higher CAD risk compared with non-carriers. Hazard ratios for CAD increased gradually from 2.2 (95%CI 0.97-5.0) to 12.0 (95%CI 5.5-24.8) across the LDL cholesterol strata. A 7.3-fold and 3.9-fold increased CAD risk was observed in carriers of class 1 and non-class 1 LDLR variants, respectively. This study presents a refined approach for classifying LDLR variants based on their impact on LDL cholesterol levels, allowing for more precise, genotype-specific CAD risk estimation in FH patients compared with traditional methods.",Huijgen R,Department of Internal Medicine,roeland.huijgen@gmail.com.

Histologic imaging via hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining is routinely performed on PDX samples, which could be harnessed for computational analysis. Prior studies of large clinical H&E image repositories have shown that deep learning analysis can identify intercellular and morphologic signals correlated with disease phenotype and therapeutic response. In this study, we developed an extensive, pan-cancer repository of >1,000 PDX and paired parental tumor H&E images. These images, curated from the PDX Development and Trial Centers Research Network Consortium, had a range of associated genomic and transcriptomic data, clinical metadata, pathologic assessments of cell composition, and, in several cases, detailed pathologic annotations of neoplastic, stromal, and necrotic regions. The amenability of these images to deep learning was highlighted through three applications: (i) development of a classifier for neoplastic, stromal, and necrotic regions; (ii) development of a predictor of xenograft-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder; and (iii) application of a published predictor of microsatellite instability. Together, this PDX Development and Trial Centers Research Network image repository provides a valuable resource for controlled digital pathology analysis, both for the evaluation of technical issues and for the development of computational image-based methods that make clinical predictions based on PDX treatment studies.

Most patients' disease progresses within a year after chemotherapy, emphasizing the need for novel strategies. Mirvetuximab soravtansine-gynx (MIRV), an antibody-drug conjugate, comprises a folate receptor alpha (FRα)-binding antibody and tubulin-targeting payload (maytansinoid DM4). In FRα-high PSOC, MIRV plus bevacizumab previously showed promising efficacy (objective response rate, 69% [95% CI: 41-89]; median progression-free survival, 13.3 months [95% CI: 8.3-18.3]; median duration of response, 12.9 months [95% CI: 6.5-15.7]) and safety. The Phase III randomized GLORIOSA trial will evaluate MIRV plus bevacizumab vs. bevacizumab alone as maintenance therapy in patients with FRα-high PSOC who did not have disease progression following second-line platinum-based doublet chemotherapy plus bevacizumab. Most patients with ovarian cancer are initially treated with platinum-based chemotherapy. If the cancer reappears/recurs after more than 6 months following this therapy, it is called platinum-sensitive ovarian cancer (PSOC). Patients with PSOC usually receive additional platinum-based chemotherapy along with bevacizumab, a drug that reduces tumor growth by decreasing its blood supply. If patients improve or are stable on this therapy, they are usually kept on bevacizumab alone for ‘maintenance therapy’. Unfortunately, this maintenance therapy does not work long-term in all patients, so better long-term treatments are needed. The GLORIOSA (NCT05445778) clinical trial will compare maintenance therapy with bevacizumab alone to maintenance therapy with bevacizumab plus a drug called mirvetuximab soravtansine-gynx (MIRV) to determine which therapy leads to better results in patients with PSOC. MIRV is made up of an antibody that binds to a specific protein (folate receptor alpha [FRα]) on cancer cells to directly deliver a cancer-killing drug. MIRV received US FDA approval to be used as a therapy for patients with ovarian cancer who are resistant to platinum-based chemotherapy and express high levels of FRα. The GLORIOSA trial will study maintenance therapy with MIRV plus bevacizumab in patients with PSOC who have not had cancer progression after second-line platinum-based chemotherapy plus bevacizumab, and whose cancer expresses high amounts of FRα. The main purpose of this trial is to determine if MIRV plus bevacizumab leads to better patient survival and decreases cancer growth and spread when compared with bevacizumab alone.",Diver E,Medical Affairs,

Changes in the brain caused by TSC usually have the biggest negative impact on quality of life. Approximately 85% of individuals with TSC have epilepsy, and TSC-associated neuropsychiatric disorders (TAND) affect nearly all individuals with TSC in some way. TSC Alliance's research strategy is built upon both funding and catalyzing research. Through grants, the organization provides funding directly to researchers through a competitive application process. The organization has also built a set of resources available to researchers worldwide, including a Natural History Database, Biosample Repository, and Preclinical Consortium. These resources catalyze research because they are available to qualified academic or industry researchers around the world, enabling an almost unlimited number of scientists to access data and resources to enable and accelerate research on TSC. This research strategy continues to be shaped by the needs and priorities of the TSC community, working toward a future where everyone affected by TSC can live their fullest lives. The role of the TSC Alliance in advancing therapy development: a patient organization perspective Finding a new treatment for any disease is a long and expensive process, and it can be even more challenging for a rare disease such as tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC). To encourage research on TSC and speed up the process developing new treatments, the TSC Alliance established a research strategy based upon the priorities of people living with TSC. TSC community members best know how the disease negatively affects their lives. Equally importantly, the TSC community is a necessary partner for any researcher or company who wants to bring forward a potential new treatment. The TSC Alliance awards research grants to individual researchers who are at early stages of their careers. We also collaborate with many researchers and healthcare providers, and with the TSC community, to build shared resources. These resources include data from medical records and biological samples, such as blood and tissue samples, which are shared with researchers around the world for a wide range of projects related to TSC. We also collaborate with researchers from academic laboratories and the pharmaceutical or biotech industry to test potential new drugs or other therapies in animals, which is required before new therapies can be tested in humans. Before and during human testing in clinical trials, we help researchers design a trial that is both meaningful to the TSC community and not overly burdensome to participants. As new therapies become available, the TSC Alliance educates the TSC community and advocates for patient access to new therapies. Over time, as more is learned about how best to monitor and treat people with TSC, the organization convenes a conference of TSC experts to update clinical consensus guidelines to guide improved treatment of this rare disease.",Roberds SL; Fuchs Z; Cassidy EM; Metzger S; Abi A; Pounders AJ; Aguiar DJ,TSC Alliance,

Traditional methods used to assess dysbiosis include the dual sugar absorption test and the urinary lactulose/mannitol ratio (LMR) measurement using mass spectrometry. Despite its precision, this approach is costly and requires specialized equipment. Hence, we developed a rapid and reliable spectrofluorimetric method for measuring LMR in urine, offering a more accessible alternative. This spectrofluorimetric assay quantifies the fluorescence of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) produced during the enzymatic oxidation of mannitol and lactulose, respectively. The assay requires 100 µL of urine samples and detects LMR values lower (eubiosis) and higher (dysbiosis) than 0.05, ultimately being amenable to high-throughput screening and automatization, making it practical for clinical and research settings. A validation of the method demonstrated its high precision, accuracy, and robustness. Additionally, this study confirmed analyte stability under various storage conditions, ensuring reliable results even with delayed analysis. Overall, this spectrofluorimetric technique reduces costs, time, and the environmental impact associated with traditional mass spectrometry methods, making it a viable option for widespread use in the assessment of dysbiosis.",,,

Human liver stem cells (HLSCs) have anti-fibrotic activity, and HLSC-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) mediate this effect. Herein, we evaluated the ability of HLSC-EVs to reverse renal and cardiac alterations in a murine model of partial nephrectomy (PNx) that mimics human CKD development. Furthermore, we investigated the contribution of extracellular matrix remodeling-related proteases to the anti-fibrotic effect of HLSC-EVs. PNx was performed by ligation of both poles of the left kidney, followed one week later by the removal of the right kidney. EV treatment started 4 weeks after the nephrectomy, when renal and cardiac alternations were already established, and mice were sacrificed at week eight. HLSC-EV treatment improved renal function and morphology, significantly decreasing interstitial fibrosis, glomerular sclerosis, and capillary rarefaction. This improvement was confirmed by the decreased expression of pro-fibrotic genes. Moreover, EV treatment improved cardiac function and reduced cardiac fibrosis. HLSC-EVs shuttled different proteases with ECM remodeling activity, and matrix metalloproteinase 1 (MMP-1) was involved in their anti-fibrotic effect on renal tissue.

39060019,Treatment-free survival and partitioned survival analysis of patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma treated with nivolumab plus ipilimumab versus sunitinib: 5-year update of CheckMate 214.,2024-07-27,Journal for immunotherapy of cancer,10.1136/jitc-2024-009495,"Immunotherapy can be associated with prolonged disease control even after cessation of treatment without the need for further cancer-directed therapy. Treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) can also persist after discontinuation of therapy. Treatment-free survival (TFS) with and without toxicity as a component of a partitioned survival model can characterize patient survival time, which is not captured by standard outcome measures. Data from 1096 patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma treated with first-line nivolumab plus ipilimumab (NIVO+IPI) versus sunitinib (SUN) in the CheckMate 214 trial were analyzed. TFS was defined as the area between two Kaplan-Meier curves for time from randomization to protocol therapy discontinuation and time from randomization to subsequent systemic therapy initiation or death, estimated as the difference in 60-month restricted mean times with confidence intervals (CIs) obtained using bootstrap sampling. Time on protocol therapy and TFS were further characterized as time with and without grade 2+ and 3+TRAEs. Survival functions were estimated in subgroups including International Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma Database Consortium risk groups using the Kaplan-Meier method. At 5 years from randomization, 48% of patients treated with NIVO+IPI and 37% of patients treated with SUN were alive. In the intent-to-treat population, 18% of the NIVO+IPI-treated and 5% of SUN-treated patients are surviving treatment-free. For favorable-risk patients, the 60-month mean TFS was 14.4 months for NIVO+IPI versus 5.5 months for SUN (difference 8.9 months (95% CI 4.9 to 12.8)). TFS for NIVO+IPI versus SUN with grade 2+TRAEs was 5.0 and 2.1 months, respectively, and with grade 3+TRAEs was 1.2 and 0.3 months, respectively. For intermediate/poor-risk patients, the 60-month mean TFS was 10.1 months for NIVO+IPI versus 4.1 months for SUN (difference 6.1 months (95% CI 4.2 to 7.9)). TFS for NIVO+IPI versus SUN with grade 2+TRAEs was 4.0 versus 2.0 months, respectively, and 0.6 versus 0.3 months with grade 3+TRAEs. Although overall survival was similar, favorable-risk patients treated with NIVO+IPI spent more time surviving treatment-free with and without toxicity versus SUN after 60 months of follow-up. Intermediate/poor-risk patients treated with NIVO+IPI had longer survival and longer TFS without toxicity versus SUN.

In practice,10.1016/j.jaip.2024.07.011,"Eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) is a chronic, food antigen-driven esophageal disorder. Connective tissue disorders (CTDs) and esophageal connective tissue alterations are associated with EoE. Therefore, angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockade with losartan, an accepted CTD treatment, is a potential EoE treatment. We evaluated losartan's effects on esophageal pathology, symptoms, and safety in patients with EoE with and without a CTD in an open-label, non-placebo controlled multisite study. Fifteen participants with EoE, aged 5 to 23 years, underwent treatment with per-protocol titrated doses of losartan in an open-label, 16-week pilot trial. Losartan was added to standard of care therapy and 14 patients completed the study. Eosinophil counts served as the primary end point, whereas we also assessed the EoE Histology Scoring System, Endoscopic Reference Scores, EoE Diagnostic Panel, and patient-reported outcomes. Esophageal eosinophilia was not reduced after losartan. The peak eosinophil count was not reduced for the proximal (median [interquartile range]: -3 [-22 to 3]; P = .49) and distal esophagus (median [interquartile range]: -18 [-39 to -1]; P = .23). There were no differences in losartan response in EoE with or without CTD (n = 7 and 8, respectively). Regardless, in a small subset of four participants esophageal eosinophilia was resolved with a concomitant reduction in EoE Histology Scoring System score and Endoscopic Reference Score. Across all subjects, the Pediatric EoE Symptom Score, Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory EoE Module, and EoE Diagnostic Panel improved after losartan (P < .05). Losartan treatment was associated with improved patient-reported outcome scores and EoE Diagnostic Panel biomarkers although without a reduction in esophageal eosinophilia overall. A subset of patients demonstrated improved histopathologic and endoscopic features that could not be tied to a specific feature predicting response to treatment.",,,saceves@ucsd.edu.

The tide has finally turned with recent advances in biochemically engineered agonists for the receptor of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and their use in GLP-1-based polyagonists. These polyagonists reduce body weight through complementary pharmacology by incorporating the receptors for glucagon and/or the glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP). In their most advanced forms, gut-hormone polyagonists achieve an unprecedented weight reduction of up to ∼20%-30%, offering a pharmacological alternative to bariatric surgery. Along with favorable effects on glycemia, fatty liver, and kidney disease, they also offer beneficial effects on the cardiovascular system and adipose tissue. These new interventions, therefore, hold great promise for the future of anti-obesity medications.",Tschöp MH,Helmholtz Munich,philipp.scherer@utsouthwestern.edu.

This case summarizes how lamotrigine can cause dangerous consequences if its pharmacology is not properly understood. The case also illustrates how the 4 Ds of a forensic malpractice suit were met in this case. First, there was duty on the part of the prescriber which, if followed, would have prevented or minimized the damages experienced by the patient. Dereliction in the performance of a patient-physician treatment contract was a direct cause of the development of Stevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis (SJS/TEN) in this patient. An immune-mediated reaction to lamotrigine or one of its metabolites has been extensively reported in the literature, with the risk of this reaction increasing at higher doses and with more rapid titration, fulfilling the elements of direct cause. Dereliction implies a deviation from the standard of care. On the basis of the clinical information from the package insert, more likely than not a deviation from the standard of care occurred in this case when lamotrigine was titrated faster than recommended by the package insert.",Masolak DD,,

DNA methylation changes are a hallmark of AML but are not routinely used as a criterion for risk stratification. The aim of this study was to explore DNA methylation markers that could risk stratify patients with cytogenetically normal AML (CN-AML), currently classified as intermediate-risk. DNA methylation profiles in whole blood samples from 77 patients with CN-AML in The Cancer Genome Atlas (LAML cohort) were analyzed. Individual 5'-cytosine-phosphate-guanine-3' (CpG) sites were assessed for their ability to predict overall survival. The output was validated using DNA methylation profiles from bone marrow samples of 79 patients with CN-AML in a separate data set from the Gene Expression Omnibus. In the training set, using DNA methylation data derived from the 450K array, we identified 2,549 CpG sites that could potentially distinguish patients with CN-AML with an adverse prognosis ( This study highlights DNA methylation profiling as a promising approach to enhance risk stratification in patients with CN-AML, potentially offering a pathway to more personalized treatment strategies.",,,

To investigate the decrease of guttae through polishing degenerated CECs and abnormal extracellular matrix (ECM) without Descemet stripping and to observe the behavior of guttae following cultured CEC transplant. This case series prospective observational study was conducted in a hospital outpatient clinic setting. Between December 2013 and January 2019, 22 eyes with corneal endothelial failure caused by FECD received cultured CEC transplant therapy at Kyoto Prefectural University Hospital. Of these, 15 eyes were consistently monitored at the same central corneal area during the preoperative phase, as well as in the early (within 1 year) and late (after 3 years) postoperative phases. The images from these phases were categorized into 3 groups: typical guttae, atypical guttae, and no guttae. Cultured CEC transplant therapy. Proportion of guttae in the observable area was measured, comparing the early and late postoperative phases for each group. The mean age of the patients at the time of surgery was 69 years (range, 49-79 years). All 15 eyes exhibited the presence of confluent guttae preoperatively (100%). Among these, 3 of 15 eyes belonged to male patients. The early postoperative phase of guttae morphologies was classified into 3 groups: 5 eyes with typical guttae, 7 with atypical guttae, and 3 with no guttae. The decrease in the number of these guttae was achieved by surgical procedures. The median percentage of guttae in the typical guttae, atypical guttae, and no guttae groups was 41.8%, 44.4%, and 16.2%, respectively, in the early phase, and 42.2%, 38.2%, and 18.8%, respectively, in the late phase. The findings demonstrate that in some cases of FECD, guttae can be removed by scraping and polishing abnormal ECM and degenerated CECs, while preserving the Descemet membrane. Furthermore, cultured CEC transplant resulted in no increase in guttae for up to 3 years, providing insights into surgically eliminating guttae.",,,

The objectives of this study were to explore the patient experience of HCC in relation to treatment options, treatment decision-making and treatment goals throughout the disease journey. This study also aimed to determine the symptoms and impacts of HCC across early, intermediate and advanced HCC. Semi-structured 60-min interviews were conducted with n = 50 patients with HCC and n = 12 healthcare professionals (HCPs) with experience of treating patients with HCC. Interview data were analyzed using directed content analysis techniques with a hybrid inductive and deductive approach. An assessment of conceptual saturation was conducted for patients' symptom experience. Patients described treatment decisions as mostly HCP-led. In this study, surgery/resection was the most frequently offered treatment option across the HCC journey, and most patients were satisfied with the treatment options presented to them. Overall, patients described extending their overall survival (OS) and preserving quality of life (QoL) as their most important treatment goals, with patients diagnosed with advanced/unresectable HCC prioritizing QoL. HCPs also prioritized OS and progression-free survival (PFS) though reported that QoL became more important as HCC progressed. Patients experienced various symptoms across the HCC journey including fatigue, nausea, appetite loss, diarrhea and pain. Overall, HCPs and patients collaborate throughout the treatment journey regarding treatment decisions and shared treatment goals. OS is critically important to patients and HCPs, though treatment goals may change depending on various clinical factors. Liver cancer is the third leading cause of cancer death worldwide. Very few studies have directly explored how patients experience liver cancer and its treatment. This research was performed to understand the patient experience of liver cancer including treatment decisions and goals, communication dynamics between patients and their treating doctors, the types of treatment offered to patients and symptoms that patients experience while living with liver cancer. Patients and doctors were interviewed to understand their experience of living with and treating liver cancer. Overall, patients and doctors work together to decide on treatment. Patients generally trusted their doctor’s knowledge and expertise when selecting the best treatment(s) for them. Treatment decisions are mostly based on how far along the cancer has progressed.

39048763,Type XII collagen is elevated in serum from patients with solid tumors: a non-invasive biomarker of activated fibroblasts.,2024-07-25,Clinical and experimental medicine,10.1007/s10238-024-01431-y,"Understanding the tumor microenvironment (TME) and extracellular matrix (ECM) is crucial in cancer research due to their impact on tumor progression. Collagens, major ECM components, regulate cell signaling and behavior. Of the 28 reported collagens, type XII collagen is known to be vital for ECM organization. Over-produced by cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), its upregulation correlates with poor survival in various cancers. This study aimed to develop an ELISA for quantifying circulating type XII collagen as a cancer biomarker. A specific ELISA targeting the C-terminal of type XII collagen was developed and used to analyze serum samples from cancer patients (n = 203) and healthy controls (n = 33). Additionally, type XII collagen expression was assessed in CAFs and normal fibroblasts (NFs) from different tissues, both under TGF-β stimulated and non-stimulated conditions. The nordicPRO-C12 ELISA demonstrated robustness and specificity for type XII collagen. PRO-C12 levels were significantly elevated in patients with various cancers compared to healthy controls and effectively distinguished between cancer patients and controls. Findings were validated using gene expression data. Furthermore, Western blot analysis revealed increased type XII collagen expression in both CAFs and NFs upon TGF-β1 stimulation, suggesting a potential role of TGF-β1 in modulating the expression of type XII collagen in cancerous and normal tissue microenvironments. This study unveils a promising avenue for harnessing PRO-C12 as a non-invasive serum biomarker, enabling the quantification of type XII collagen fragments in cancer patients. Further investigations are warranted to explore the potential of PRO-C12 across different cancer types and disease stages, shedding light on its multifaceted role in cancer development.",Crespo-Bravo M; Hettich A; Thorlacius-Ussing J; Karsdal MA; Willumsen N,Nordic Bioscience A/S,mcb@nordicbio.com.

PAC inhibits interleukin 6 (IL-6) receptor activity and pathogenic T helper cell 1 (Th1)/Th17 differentiation in preclinical models and the phase 1 trial. Herein, we report on our completed phase 2 trial of PAC/SIR/TAC after 8/8 human leukocyte antigen matched alloHCT. This single-arm phase 2 trial (NCT02891603) was powered to determine if PAC/SIR/TAC suppressed percentage phosphorylated STAT3 (pSTAT3)+ CD4+ T cells at day +21 (primary end point: percentage pSTAT3+ CD4+ T cells ≤ 35%) and estimated grade II to IV acute GVHD by day +100. The impact of PAC/SIR/TAC on T-cell subsets, CD28 (pS6 and pH3ser10), and IL-2 receptor (pSTAT5) signal transduction was also evaluated. Eligible patients (n = 28) received alloHCT for hematologic malignancies or myeloproliferative neoplasms. Reduced or myeloablative intensity conditioning was permitted. PAC/SIR/TAC met the primary end point, reducing percentage pSTAT3+ CD4+ T cells to 9.62% at day +21. Th1/Th17 cells were decreased at day +21, increasing the ratio of regulatory T cells to Th1 and Th17 cells with PAC/SIR/TAC at recommended phase 2 dose PAC compared with dose level 1 PAC. The cumulative incidence of grade II to IV acute GVHD by day +100 with PAC/SIR/TAC was similar to historic SIR/TAC values (46% vs 43%).

The US Food and Drug Administration has mandated patients remain close to the treatment center for 4 weeks as part of a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy to monitor and manage these toxicities, which, although cautious, may add to cost of care, be burdensome for patients and their families, and present challenges related to patient access and socioeconomic disparities. This retrospective study across 9 centers involving 475 patients infused with axi-cel, tisa-cel, and liso-cel from 2018 to 2023 aimed to assess CRS and ICANS onset and duration, as well as causes of nonrelapse mortality (NRM) in real-world CAR T recipients. Although differences were noted in the incidence and duration of CRS and ICANS between CAR T products, new-onset CRS and ICANS are exceedingly rare after 2 weeks after infusion (0% and 0.7% of patients, respectively). No new cases of CRS occurred after 2 weeks and a single case of new-onset ICANS occurred in the third week after infusion. NRM is driven by ICANS in the early follow-up period (1.1% until day 28) and then by infection through 3 months after infusion (1.2%).

Personalized in vitro breast cancer models hold great promise for high-throughput testing of therapeutic strategies to normalize the aberrant microenvironment in a patient-specific manner. Here, tumoroids assembled from breast cancer cell lines (MCF7, SKBR3, and MDA-MB-468) and patient-derived breast tumor cells (TCs) cultured in microphysiological systems including perfusable microvasculature reproduce key aspects of stromal and vascular dysfunction causing impaired drug delivery. Models containing SKBR3 and MDA-MB-468 tumoroids show higher stromal hyaluronic acid (HA) deposition, vascular permeability, interstitial fluid pressure (IFP), and degradation of vascular HA relative to models containing MCF7 tumoroids or models without tumoroids. Interleukin 8 (IL8) secretion is found responsible for vascular dysfunction and loss of vascular HA. Interventions targeting IL8 or stromal HA normalize vascular permeability, perfusion, and IFP, and ultimately enhance drug delivery and TC death in response to perfusion with trastuzumab and cetuximab. Similar responses are observed in patient-derived models. These microphysiological systems can thus be personalized by using patient-derived cells and can be applied to discover new molecular therapies for the normalization of the tumor microenvironment.",Possenti L; Hickman D; Knutson CG,Amgen Research; LaBS,

Here, we investigated the impact of vaccination and SARS-CoV-2 infection on maternal-neonate immune response in a cohort study involving 141 pregnant individuals, and defined the importance of maternal COVID-19 vaccination timing for its effectiveness. Our data indicate that vertically transferred maternal hybrid immunity provides significantly better antiviral protection for a neonate than either maternal post-infection or post-vaccination immunity alone. Higher neutralization potency among mothers immunized before pregnancy and their newborns highlights the promising role of pre-pregnancy vaccination in neonatal protection. A comparison of neutralizing antibody titers calculated for each dyad suggests that infection and pre-/during-pregnancy vaccination all support transplacental transfer, providing the offspring with strong passive immunity against SARS-CoV-2. Analysis of neutralizing antibody levels in maternal sera collected during pregnancy and later during delivery shows that immunization may exert a positive effect on maternal protection.",Cho H,KR Biotech Co.,

A phase 1/2 study of the Akt/mTOR inhibitor and autophagy inducer Ibrilatazar (ABTL0812) in combination with paclitaxel/carboplatin in patients with advanced/recurrent endometrial cancer.,2024-07-22,BMC cancer,10.1186/s12885-024-12501-5,"Carboplatin and paclitaxel (CP) have been the standard of care for advanced/recurrent endometrial cancer (EC) for many years. However, this chemotherapy combination shows limited efficacy and recurrences often occur in less than 12 months. ABTL0812 is a novel drug that selectively kill cancer cells by cytotoxic autophagy and has shown anticancer efficacy in preclinical models of EC in combination with CP. ENDOLUNG was an open-label, phase 1/2 clinical trial designed to determine the safety and efficacy of Ibrilatazar (ABTL0812) with CP in patients with advanced/recurrent EC and non-irradiable stage III and IV squamous non-small cell lung cancer (sq-NSCLC). The phase 1 part consisted of a 3 + 3 de-escalation design followed by an expansion cohort with 12 patients. The primary endpoint was safety. ABTL0812 starting dose was 1300 mg tid combined with carboplatin at area under the curve (AUC) 5 and paclitaxel at 175 mg/m During the phase 1 only one dose limiting toxicity (DLT), a grade 4 neutropenia, was observed in 1 out of 6 patients, thus no de-escalation was applied. One additional DLT, a grade 3 febrile neutropenia, was observed in the expansion cohort, thus the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) for ABTL0812 was established at 1300 mg tid. Most frequent hematological adverse events (AE) of the combination were neutropenia (52.9%), anemia (37.3%) and thrombocytopenia (19.6%). Nausea (66.7%), asthenia (66.7%), diarrhea (54.9%) and vomiting (54.9%) were the most frequent non-hematological adverse events (AEs). The combination of ABTL0812 plus CP showed an ORR of 65.8% (13.2% complete response and 52.6% partial response) with a median DOR of 7.4 months (95% CI: 6.3-10.8 months). Median PFS was 9.8 months (95% CI: 6.6-10.6) and median OS 23.6 months (95% CI 6.4-ND).

We aimed to develop and validate a natural language processing (NLP) algorithm to extract oncologists' documentation of stage in the national Veterans Affairs (VA) Healthcare System. Using nationwide electronic health record (EHR) and cancer registry data from the VA Corporate Data Warehouse, we developed and validated a rule-based NLP algorithm to extract oncologist-determined MM stage. To that end, a clinician annotated MM stage within over 5,000 short snippets of clinical notes, and annotated MM stage at MM treatment initiation for 200 patients. These were allocated into snippet- and patient-level development and validation sets. We developed MM stage extraction and roll-up algorithms within the development sets. After the algorithms were finalized, we validated them using standard measures in held-out validation sets. We developed algorithms for three different MM staging systems that have been in widespread use (Revised International Staging System [R-ISS], International Staging System [ISS], and Durie-Salmon [DS]) and for stage reported without a clearly defined system. Precision and recall were uniformly high for MM stage at the snippet level, ranging from 0.92 to 0.99 for the different MM staging systems. Performance in identifying for MM stage at treatment initiation at the patient level was also excellent, with precision of 0.92, 0.96, 0.90, and 0.86 and recall of 0.99, 0.98, 0.94, and 0.92 for R-ISS, ISS, DS, and unclear stage, respectively. Our MM stage extraction algorithm uses rule-based NLP and data aggregation to accurately measure MM stage documented in oncology notes and pathology reports in VA's national EHR system. It may be adapted to other systems where MM stage is recorded in clinical notes.",Dharne M; Munshi NC,VA Boston Healthcare System,
39038086,Demystifying the Contemporary Role of 12-Month Dual Antiplatelet Therapy After Acute Coronary Syndrome.,2024-07-22,Circulation,10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.124.069012,"For almost two decades, 12-month dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) in acute coronary syndrome (ACS) has been the only class I recommendation on DAPT in American and European guidelines, which has resulted in 12-month durations of DAPT therapy being the most frequently implemented in ACS patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) across the globe. Twelve-month DAPT was initially grounded in the results of the CURE (Clopidogrel in Unstable Angina to Prevent Recurrent Events) trial, which, by design, studied DAPT versus no DAPT rather than the optimal DAPT duration. The average DAPT duration in this study was 9 months, not 12 months. Subsequent ACS studies, which were not designed to assess DAPT duration, rather its composition (aspirin with prasugrel or ticagrelor compared with clopidogrel) were further interpreted as supportive evidence for 12-month DAPT duration. In these studies, the median DAPT duration was 9 or 15 months for ticagrelor and prasugrel, respectively. Several subsequent studies questioned the 12-month regimen and suggested that DAPT duration should either be fewer than 12 months in patients at high bleeding risk or more than 12 months in patients at high ischemic risk who can safely tolerate the treatment. Bleeding, rather than ischemic risk assessment, has emerged as a treatment modifier for maximizing the net clinical benefit of DAPT, due to excessive bleeding and no clear benefit of prolonged treatment regimens in high bleeding risk patients. Multiple DAPT de-escalation treatment strategies, including switching from prasugrel or ticagrelor to clopidogrel, reducing the dose of prasugrel or ticagrelor, and shortening DAPT duration while maintaining monotherapy with ticagrelor, have been consistently shown to reduce bleeding without increasing fatal or nonfatal cardiovascular or cerebral ischemic risks compared with 12-month DAPT. However, 12-month DAPT remains the only class-I DAPT recommendation for patients with ACS despite the lack of prospectively established evidence, leading to unnecessary and potentially harmful overtreatment in many patients. It is time for clinical practice and guideline recommendations to be updated to reflect the totality of the evidence regarding the optimal DAPT duration in ACS.",Mehta SR; Montalescot G,ACTION Group; Hamilton Health Sciences,

Haematology,10.1016/S2352-3026(24)00172-8,"Richter transformation usually presents as an aggressive diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, occurs in up to 10% of patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, has no approved therapies, and is associated with a poor prognosis. Pirtobrutinib has shown promising efficacy and tolerability in patients with relapsed or refractory B-cell malignancies, including those who progress on covalent Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitors. This study aims to report the safety and activity of pirtobrutinib monotherapy in a subgroup of patients with Richter transformation from the multicentre, open-label, phase 1/2 BRUIN study. This analysis included adult patients (aged ≥18 years) with histologically confirmed Richter transformation, an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status score of 0-2, and no limit of previous therapies, with patients receiving first-line treatment added in a protocol amendment (version 9.0, Dec 15, 2021). Pirtobrutinib 200 mg was administered orally once a day in 28-day cycles. The primary endpoint of phase 1 of the BRUIN trial as a whole, which has been previously reported, was to establish the recommended phase 2 dose for pirtobrutinib monotherapy and the phase 2 primary endpoint was overall response rate. Safety and activity were measured in all patients who received at least one dose of pirtobrutinib monotherapy. This BRUIN phase 1/2 trial was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov and is closed to enrolment (NCT03740529). Between Dec 26, 2019, and July 22, 2022, 82 patients were enrolled, of whom five were enrolled during phase 1 and 77 during phase 2. All but one patient received a starting dose of 200 mg pirtobrutinib once a day as the recommended phase 2 dose. The remaining patient received 150 mg pirtobrutinib once a day, which was not escalated to 200 mg. The median age of patients was 67 years (IQR 59-72). 55 (67%) of 82 patients were male and 27 (33%) were female. Most patients were White (65 [79%] of 82). 74 (90%) of 82 patients received at least one previous Richter transformation-directed therapy. Most patients (61 [74%] of 82) had received previous covalent BTK inhibitor therapy for chronic lymphocytic leukaemia or Richter transformation. The overall response rate was 50·0% (95% CI 38·7-61·3). 11 (13%) of 82 patients had a complete response and 30 (37%) of 82 patients had a partial response. Eight patients with ongoing response electively discontinued pirtobrutinib to undergo stem-cell transplantation. The most common grade 3 or worse adverse event was neutropenia (n=19). There were no treatment-related deaths. Pirtobrutinib shows promising safety and activity among patients with Richter transformation, most of whom received previous Richter transformation-directed therapy, including covalent BTK inhibitors. These data suggest that further investigation is warranted of pirtobrutinib as a treatment option for patients with relapsed or refractory Richter transformation after treatment with a covalent BTK inhibitor.

Understanding the FI improves the interpretation of the results of meta-analyses and can help to inform changes to clinical practice. This review determined the fragility of ophthalmology-related meta-analyses. Meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials with binary outcomes published in a journal classified as 'Ophthalmology' according to the Journal Citation Report or an Ophthalmology-related Cochrane Review were included. An iterative process determined the FI of each meta-analysis. Multivariable linear regression modeling evaluated the relationship between the FI and potential predictive factors in statistically significant and non-significant meta-analyses. 175 meta-analyses were included. The median FI was 6 (Q1-Q3: 3-12). This meant that moving 6 outcomes from one group to another would reverse the study's findings. The FI was 1 for 18 (10.2%) of the included meta-analyses and was ≤5 for 75 (42.4%) of the included meta-analyses. The number of events (p < 0.001) and the p-value (p < 0.001) were the best predictors of the FI in both significant and non-significant meta-analyses. The statistical significance of meta-analyses in ophthalmology often hinges on the outcome of a few patients. The number of events and the p-value are the most important factors in determining the fragility of the evidence. The FI is an easily interpretable measure that can supplement the reader's understanding of the strength of the evidence being presented.

Fluid accumulation syndrome (FAS) is defined as fluid accumulation (any degree, expressed as percentage from baseline body weight) with new onset organ-failure. Over the years, many studies have described the negative impact of FAS on clinically relevant outcomes. While the relationship between FAS and ICU outcomes is well described, uncertainty exists regarding its diagnosis, monitoring and treatment. A stepwise approach is suggested to prevent and treat FAS in patients with septic shock, including minimizing fluid intake (e.g., by limiting intravenous fluid administration and employing de-escalation whenever possible), limiting sodium and chloride administration, and maximizing fluid output (e.g., with diuretics, or renal replacement therapy). Current literature implies the need for a multi-tier, multi-modal approach to de-resuscitation, combining a restrictive fluid management regime with a standardized early active de-resuscitation, maintenance fluid reduction (avoiding fluid creep) and potentially using physical measures such as compression stockings.Trial registration: Not applicable.",van Regenmortel N,Department of Intensive Care Medicine,carmen.pfortmueller@insel.ch.

Alcohol exacerbates liver damage by inducing gut dysbiosis, bacterial translocation and inflammation, which is characterised by increased numbers of circulating and hepatic neutrophils. In this study, we performed tandem mass tag (TMT) proteomics to analyse proteins in the faeces of controls (n=19), patients with alcohol-use disorder (AUD; n=20) and AH (n=80) from a multicentre cohort (InTeam). To identify protein groups that are disproportionately represented, we conducted over-representation analysis using Reactome pathway analysis and Gene Ontology to determine the proteins with the most significant impact. A faecal biomarker and its prognostic effect were validated by ELISA in faecal samples from patients with AH (n=70), who were recruited in a second and independent multicentre cohort (AlcHepNet). Faecal proteomic profiles were overall significantly different between controls, patients with AUD and AH (principal component analysis p=0.001, dissimilarity index calculated by the method of Bray-Curtis). Proteins that showed notable differences across all three groups and displayed a progressive increase in accordance with the severity of alcohol-associated liver disease were predominantly those located in neutrophil granules. Over-representation and Reactome analyses confirmed that differentially regulated proteins are part of granules in neutrophils and the neutrophil degranulation pathway. Myeloperoxidase (MPO), the marker protein of neutrophil granules, correlates with disease severity and predicts 60-day mortality. Using an independent validation cohort, we confirmed that faecal MPO levels can predict short-term survival at 60 days. We found an increased abundance of faecal proteins linked to neutrophil degranulation in patients with AH, which is predictive of short-term survival and could serve as a prognostic non-invasive marker.",Stärkel P; Caballería J; Louvet A; Mathurin P; Investigators A,Roster for authorship; Department of Hepatology and Gastroenterology; Centro de Investigación en Red de Enfermedades Hepáticas y Digestivas (CIBERehd); Service des Maladies de L'appareil Digestif et Unité INFINITE 1286,beschnabl@ucsd.edu.

The resulting cells retain enhanced lytic ability for up to 7 days as well as after cryopreservation, and memory-like NK cells (mlNK) have been shown to induce complete remissions in patients with hematological malignancies. No single phenotype has been described for mlNK and the physiological changes induced by the short-term cytokine or tumor-priming which are responsible for these enhanced functions have not been fully characterized. Here, we have generated mlNK by cytokine and tumor-priming to find commonalities to better define the nature of NK cell ""memory"" in vitro and, for the first time, in vivo. We initiated mlNK in vitro from healthy donors with cytokines (initiated cytokine-induced memory-like (iCIML)-NK) and by tumor priming (TpNK) overnight and compared them by high-dimensional flow cytometry, proteomic and metabolomic profiling. As a potential mechanism of enhanced cytolytic function, we analyzed the avidity of binding of the mlNK to NK-resistant tumors (z-Movi). We generated TpNK from healthy donors and from cancer patients to determine whether mlNK generated by interaction with a single tumor type could enhance lytic activity. Finally, we used a replication-incompetent tumor cell line (INKmune) to treat patients with myeloid leukaemias to potentiate NK cell function in vivo. Tumor-primed mlNK from healthy donors and patients with cancer showed increased cytotoxicity against multiple tumor cell lines in vitro, analogous to iCIML-NK cells. Multidimensional cytometry identified distinct memory-like profiles of subsets of cells with memory-like characteristics; upregulation of CD57, CD69, CD25 and ICAM1. Proteomic profiling identified 41 proteins restricted to mlNK cells and we identified candidate molecules for the basis of NK memory which can explain how mlNK overcome inhibition by resistant tumors. Finally, of five patients with myelodysplastic syndrome or refractory acute myeloid leukemia treated with INKmune, three responded to treatment with measurable increases in NK lytic function and systemic cytokines. NK cell ""memory"" is a physiological state associated with resistance to MHC-mediated inhibition, increased metabolic function, mitochondrial fitness and avidity to NK-resistant target cells.",Das K,LUMICKS,m.lowdell@ucl.ac.uk.

Research has shown that socket preservation techniques using bone graft substitutes can effectively minimize early bone loss in such cases. α-calcium sulfate hemihydrate (α-CSH) has garnered significant attention as a potential bone graft material due to its favorable properties, including osteoconductivity, angiogenic potential, and biocompatibility. Considering these facts, we developed a preliminary protocol for applying α-CSH in addressing alveolar bone loss following tooth extraction. This research's general objective is to evaluate the feasibility and initial effectiveness of α-CSH as bone-inducing graft material for socket preservation after tooth extraction. This preliminary clinical trial will involve 30 fresh extraction sockets from individuals aged 18-35 years. The participants will be divided into 2 groups: one group will receive α-CSH graft material after tooth extraction for socket preservation, while the other group will not receive any graft material. Throughout the study, the participants will be closely monitored for safety measures, which will include clinical examinations, radiographic imaging, and blood tests. Radiographic imaging will be used extensively to assist the progress of bone formation. The study commenced enrollment in August 2022 and is scheduled to conclude post assessments and analyses by the end of 2023. The results of the study are anticipated to be accessible in late 2024. This clinical study represents the initial investigation in humans to assess the feasibility and efficacy of α-CSH in alveolar bone regeneration. We hypothesize that the inclusion of α-CSH can greatly expedite the process of bone formation within fresh sockets, resulting in a swift restoration of bone height without the disadvantages associated with harvesting autogenous bone graft.

The EDITA-ON study aimed to assess long-term effects of open label therapy with ambrisentan vs. no pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) therapy. Patients who participated in the EDITA study and received regular follow-up were included in EDITA-ON. Clinical, echocardiographic, laboratory, exercise and hemodynamic parameters during follow-up were analysed. The primary endpoint was to assess whether continued treatment with ambrisentan vs. no treatment prevented the development of PAH according to the new definition. Of 38 SSc patients included in the EDITA study four were lost to follow-up. Of the 34 remaining patients (age 55 ± 11 years, 82.1% female subjects), 19 received ambrisentan after termination of the blinded phase, 15 received no PAH medication. The mean follow-up time was 2.59 ± 1.47 years, during which 29 patients underwent right heart catheterization. There was a significant improvement of mPAP in catheterised patients receiving ambrisentan vs. no PAH treatment (-1.53 ± 2.53 vs. 1.91 ± 2.98 mmHg, p = 0.003). In patients without PAH treatment 6/12 patients had PAH vs. 1/17 of patients receiving ambrisentan (p < 0.0001). In SSc patients with early PVD, the development of PAH and/or deterioration was less frequent among patients receiving ambrisentan, indicating that early treatment and close follow-up could be beneficial in this high-risk group.

In each treatment arm, higher baseline tumor mutational burden or immune infiltration/inflammation was associated with improved efficacy compared with lower levels. On-treatment peripheral biomarker changes showed that BEMPEG + NIVO increased all immune cell subset counts interrogated, including regulatory T cells. This was followed by attenuation of the increase in CD8 + T cells, conventional CD4 + T cells, and systemic interferon gamma levels at later treatment cycles in the combination arm.

The sesquiterpenoid hormones and their synthetic mimics are agonist ligands of a unique JH receptor (JHR) protein, methoprene-tolerant (MET). Upon binding an agonist to its PAS-B cavity, MET dissociates from a cytoplasmic chaperone complex including HSP83 and concomitantly switches to a bHLH-PAS partner taiman, forming a nuclear, transcriptionally active JHR heterodimer. This course of events resembles the vertebrate aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR), activated by a plethora of endogenous and synthetic compounds. Like in AHR, the pliable PAS-B cavity of MET adjusts to diverse ligands and binds them through similar mechanisms. Despite recent progress, we only begin to discern agonist-induced conformational shifts within the PAS-B domain, with the ultimate goal of understanding how these localized changes stimulate the assembly of the active JHR complex and, thus, fully grasp the mechanism of JHR signaling.",,,jindra@entu.cas.cz.

Preclinical data suggest that nirmatrelvir-ritonavir might be more effective than remdesivir alone or in combination with nirmatrelvir-ritonavir for people at high risk of severe COVID-19. We aimed to assess the safety and effectiveness of combining remdesivir and nirmatrelvir-ritonavir compared with using each drug alone for adults hospitalised with COVID-19. In this target trial emulation study, we used electronic health records of patients aged 18 years or older who received either combination treatment of nirmatrelvir-ritonavir and remdesivir or monotherapy of either drug between March 16 and Dec 31, 2022, within 5 days of hospitalisation for COVID-19 in Hong Kong. Inverse probability of treatment weighting was applied to balance baseline patient characteristics across the treatment groups. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality. Cox proportional hazards regression adjusting weighting was used to compare the risk of all-cause mortality, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, or ventilatory support for 90 days of follow-up between groups. Between March 16 and Dec 31, 2022, 18 196 participants were identified from electronic health records and assigned to receive remdesivir (n=4232), nirmatrelvir-ritonavir (n=13 656), or nirmatrelvir-ritonavir and remdesivir (n=308). By applying an inverse probability of treatment weighting, a weighted sample composed of 18 410 recipients of nirmatrelvir-ritonavir and remdesivir combination treatment, 18 178 recipients of remdesivir monotherapy, and 18 287 recipients of nirmatrelvir-ritonavir monotherapy was obtained. After a median follow-up of 84 days (IQR 45-90), risk of mortality was lower in patients who received nirmatrelvir-ritonavir monotherapy (hazard ratio [HR] 0·18 [95% CI 0·15 to 0·20]; absolute risk reduction [ARR] -16·33% [95% CI -16·98 to -15·68]) or remdesivir and nirmatrelvir-ritonavir combination therapy (HR 0·66 [95% CI 0·49 to 0·89]; ARR -6·52% [95% CI -7·29 to -5·74]) than in patients who received remdesivir monotherapy. Similar results were observed for ICU admission or ventilatory support (nirmatrelvir-ritonavir monotherapy: HR 0·09 [95% CI 0·07 to 0·11]; ARR -10·04% [95% CI -10·53 to -9·56]; combination therapy: HR 0·68 [95% CI 0·42 to 1·12]; ARR -3·24% [95% CI -3·84 to -2·64]). Compared with combination therapy, nirmatrelvir-ritonavir monotherapy was associated with lower risk of mortality (HR 0·27 [95% CI 0·20 to 0·37]; ARR -9·81% [95% CI -10·39 to -9·24]) and ICU admission or ventilatory support (HR 0·13 [95% CI 0·08 to 0·22]; ARR -6·80% [95% CI -7·22 to -6·39]). Our study highlighted the potential for reduced risk of mortality, ICU admission, or the need for ventilatory support in patients hospitalised with COVID-19 treated with nirmatrelvir-ritonavir as a monotherapy compared with treatment regimens based on nirmatrelvir-ritonavir and remdesivir combination therapy or remdesivir monotherapy.

Diabetes is a well-known risk factor for PAD, and the occurrence of PAD in people with T2D further increases the risk of long-term complications. As the available evidence is primarily focused on the overall PAD population, we undertook a systematic review to describe the burden of comorbid PAD in people with T2D. The MEDLINE, Embase and Cochrane Library databases were searched for studies including people with T2D and comorbid PAD published from 2012 to November 2021, with no restriction on PAD definition, study design or country. Hand searching of conference proceedings, reference lists of included publications and relevant identified reviews and global burden of disease reports complemented the searches. We identified 86 eligible studies, mostly observational and conducted in Asia and Europe, presenting data on the epidemiology (n = 62) and on the clinical (n = 29), humanistic (n = 12) and economic burden (n = 12) of PAD in people with T2D. The most common definition of PAD relied on ankle-brachial index values ≤ 0.9 (alone or with other parameters). Incidence and prevalence varied substantially across studies; nonetheless, four large multinational randomised controlled trials found that 12.5%-22% of people with T2D had comorbid PAD. The presence of PAD in people with T2D was a major cause of lower-limb and CV complications and of all-cause and CV mortality. Overall, PAD was associated with poor quality of life, and with substantial healthcare resource use and costs. To our knowledge, this systematic review provides the most comprehensive overview of the evidence on the burden of PAD in people with T2D to date. In this population, there is an urgent unmet need for disease-modifying agents to improve outcomes.",Mangla KK; Nielsen NF; Hansen Y,Novo Nordisk A/S,Subodh.Verma@unityhealth.to.

Niraparib was originally approved in recurrent OC at a fixed starting dose (FSD) of 300 mg once daily (QD). This analysis characterized the population pharmacokinetics (PK) of niraparib and evaluated the relationships between exposure, efficacy, and safety to support clinical use of an individualized dosing strategy, in which the starting dose of niraparib was adjusted based on patient characteristics to improve the benefit-risk profile. A population PK model was developed by pooling data from four niraparib clinical trials (PN001 [n = 104], QUADRA [n = 455], NOVA [n = 403], and PRIMA [n = 480]) in patients with solid tumors, including OC. Exposure-response analyses were conducted to explore the relationships of niraparib exposure with progression-free survival (PFS) and adverse events in the PRIMA study. A multivariate logistic regression model was also developed to estimate the probability of grade ≥3 thrombocytopenia, using data from patients enrolled in PRIMA and NOVA. The impact of an individualized starting dose (ISD) regimen (200 mg QD in patients with body weight [BW] <77 kg or platelet count [PLT] <150,000/µL, or 300 mg QD in patients with BW ≥77 kg and PLT ≥150,000/µL) on systemic exposure, efficacy, and safety was assessed. Niraparib disposition was best described by a 3-compartment model with linear elimination. Key covariates included baseline creatinine clearance, BW, albumin, and age, all of which had minor effects on niraparib exposure. Comparable model-predicted exposure up to the time of disease progression/death or censoring in the 300-mg FSD and 200-/300-mg ISD groups was consistent with the lower rate of dose reduction in the ISD groups. No consistent niraparib exposure-response relationship was observed for efficacy in all PRIMA patients (first-line OC), and no statistically significant difference was seen in PFS curves for patients receiving a niraparib dose of 200 mg versus 300 mg. In the multivariate regression model, performed using combined data from PRIMA and NOVA, higher niraparib exposure (area under the concentration-time curve at steady-state [AUC Population PK and exposure-response analyses support use of an ISD to improve the safety profile of niraparib, including reducing the rate of grade ≥3 thrombocytopenia, without compromising efficacy.

39019116,Dietary medium-chain fatty acids reduce hepatic fat accumulation via activation of a CREBH-FGF21 axis.,2024-08-05,Molecular metabolism,10.1016/j.molmet.2024.101991,"Dietary medium-chain fatty acids (MCFAs), characterized by chain lengths of 8-12 carbon atoms, have been proposed to have beneficial effects on glucose and lipid metabolism, yet the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. We hypothesized that MCFA intake benefits metabolic health by inducing the release of hormone-like factors. The effects of chow diet, high-fat diet rich in long-chain fatty acids (LCFA HFD) fed ad libitum or pair-fed to a high-fat diet rich in MCFA (MCFA HFD) on glycemia, hepatic gene expression, circulating fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21), and liver fat content in both wildtype and Fgf21 knockout mice were investigated. The impact of a single oral dose of an MCFA-rich oil on circulating FGF21 and hepatic Fgf21 mRNA expression was assessed. In flag-tagged Crebh knockin mice and liver-specific Crebh knockout mice, fed LCFA HFD or MCFA HFD, active hepatic CREBH and hepatic Fgf21 mRNA abundance were determined, respectively. MCFA HFD improves glucose tolerance, enhances glucose clearance into brown adipose tissue, and prevents high-fat diet-induced hepatic steatosis in wildtype mice. These benefits are associated with increased liver expression of CREBH target genes (Apoa4 and Apoc2), including Fgf21. Both acute and chronic intake of dietary MCFAs elevate circulating FGF21. Augmented hepatic Fgf21 mRNA following MCFA HFD intake is accompanied by higher levels of active hepatic CREBH; and MCFA-induced hepatic Fgf21 expression is blocked in mice lacking Crebh. Notably, while feeding male and female Fgf21 wildtype mice MCFA HFD results in reduced liver triacylglycerol (TG) levels, this liver TG-lowering effect is blunted in Fgf21 knockout mice fed MCFA HFD. The reduction in liver TG levels observed with MCFA HFD was independent of weight loss. Dietary MCFAs reduce liver fat accumulation via activation of a CREBH-FGF21 signaling axis.",,,hshimano@md.tsukuba.ac.jp.

Paliperidone palmitate (PP) once every 6 months is the first and currently only LAI antipsychotic with an extended dosing interval of 6 months. To assess long-term outcomes of PP received once every 6 months in adults with schizophrenia. In a 2-year open-label extension (OLE) study of a 1-year randomized clinical trial (RCT), eligible adults with schizophrenia could choose to continue PP every 6 months if they had not experienced relapse after receiving PP once every 3 or 6 months in the 1-year, international, multicenter, double-blind, randomized noninferiority trial. The present analysis focused on patients receiving PP every 6 months in the double-blind trial through the OLE study (November 20, 2017, to May 3, 2022). Patients received a dorsogluteal injection of PP on day 1 and once every 6 months up to month 30. End points included assessment of relapse and change from the double-blind trial baseline to the OLE end point in Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) total and subscale, Clinical Global Impression-Severity (CGI-S) Scale, and Personal Social Performance (PSP) Scale scores. Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), injection site evaluations, and laboratory tests were also assessed. Among 121 patients (83 [68.6%] male), mean (SD) age at baseline was 38.6 (11.24) years and mean (SD) duration of illness was 11.0 (9.45) years. At screening of the double-blind study, 101 patients (83.5%) were taking an oral antipsychotic and 20 (16.5%) were taking an LAI antipsychotic. Altogether, 5 of 121 patients (4.1%) experienced relapse during the 3-year follow-up; reasons for relapse were psychiatric hospitalization (2 [1.7%]), suicidal or homicidal ideation (2 [1.7%]), and deliberate self-injury (1 [0.8%]). Patients treated with PP every 6 months were clinically and functionally stable, and outcomes were well maintained, evidenced by stable scores on the PANSS (mean [SD] change, -2.6 [9.96] points), CGI-S (mean [SD] change, -0.2 [0.57] points), and PSP (mean [SD] change, 3.1 [9.14] points) scales over the 3-year period. In total, 101 patients (83.5%) completed the 2-year OLE. At least 1 TEAE was reported in 97 of 121 patients (80.2%) overall; no new safety or tolerability concerns were identified.

Proof-of-concept work in AD supports using cendakimab for type 2 inflammatory diseases. To evaluate the efficacy and safety of cendakimab compared with placebo in patients with moderate to severe AD. This phase 2, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, dose-ranging clinical trial was conducted from May 2021 to November 2022. Adult patients with moderate to severe AD and inadequate response to topical medications were enrolled at 69 sites in 5 countries (US [n = 26], Japan [n = 17], Canada [n = 9], Poland [n = 9], and Czech Republic [n = 8]). Data were analyzed between April 25, 2023, and October 16, 2023.

The treatment effect for 360 mg, every 2 weeks (-16.3; nominal P = .03 vs placebo) was comparable with 720 mg, once weekly (-21.8); however, significance was not claimed because the hierarchical testing sequence was interrupted. Of patients with treatment-emergent adverse events leading to discontinuation, 4 (7.4%) received 720 mg, once weekly; 2 (3.6%) 720 mg, every 2 weeks; 1 (1.8%) 360 mg, every 2 weeks; and 2 (3.6%) placebo. The results of this randomized clinical trial indicated that cendakimab was effective, generally safe, and well-tolerated in patients with moderate to severe AD.

We aimed to explore the value of serum N-glycan markers in liver fibrosis. This multi-center (33 hospitals) study recruited 760 treatment-naïve CHB patients who underwent liver biopsy. Serum N-glycan markers were analyzed by DNA sequencer-assisted fluorophore-assisted with capillary electrophoresis (DSA-FACE) technology. First, we explore the relationship between 12 serum N-glycan markers and the fibrosis stage. Then, we developed a Px score for diagnosing significant fibrosis using the LASSO regression. Next, we compared the diagnostic performances between Px, LSM, APRI, and FIB-4. Finally, we explored the relationships between glycosyltransferase gene and liver fibrosis with RNA-transcriptome sequencing. We included 622 CHB participants: male-dominated (69.6%); median age 42.0 (IQR 34.0-50.0); 287 with normal ALT; 73.0% with significant fibrosis. P5(NA2), P8(NA3), and P10(NA4) were opposite to the degree of fibrosis, while other profiles (except for P0[NGA2]) increased with the degree of fibrosis. Seven profiles (P1[NGA2F], P2[NGA2FB], P3[NG1A2F], P4[NG1A2F], P7[NA2FB], P8[NA3], and P9[NA3Fb]) were selected into Px score. Px score was associated with an increased risk of significant fibrosis (for per Px score increase, the risk of significant fibrosis was increased by 3.54 times (OR = 4.54 [2.63-7.82]) in the fully-adjusted generalized linear model. p for trend was <0.001. The diagnostic performance of the Px score was superior to others. Glycosyltransferase genes were overexpressed in liver fibrosis, and glycosylation and glycosyltransferase-related pathways were significantly enriched. Serum N-glycan markers were positively correlated with liver fibrosis.

There has been a shift in the epidemiology of pertussis toward older children and adults. This shift has been attributed to the waning of infection- or vaccine-induced immunity, newer detection techniques causing detection bias, and possibly the replacement of whole-cell pertussis with acellular vaccines in high-income countries, which may lead to immunity waning more quickly. The burden of adult pertussis is still likely under-ascertained due to widespread under-recognition by healthcare professionals (HCPs), under-diagnosis, and under-reporting in this age group. Non-standardized testing guidance and varied case definitions have contributed to under-reporting. Key barriers to HCP engagement with the tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis (Tdap) vaccine include low awareness, lack of time/funding, and lack of motivation due to low prioritization of Tdap.",Rizzo A; Sampson K; Sobczyk E; von König CHW,American Lung Association; Immunisation Coalition; Clinical Microbiology Consultant; AMDA - The Society for Post-Acute and Long-Term Care Medicine,

Our group recently introduced partial freezing, a novel approach in high-subzero storage at -15°C, enabling 5 days storage of rodent livers through precise control over ice nucleation and unfrozen fraction. However, increased vascular resistance and tissue edema suggested a need for improvements to extend viable preservation. Here, we describe an optimized partial freezing protocol with key optimizations including increased concentration of propylene glycol to reduce ice recrystallization and maintained osmotic balance through an increase in bovine serum albumin, all while minimizing sheer stress during cryoprotectant unloading with an acclimation period. These approaches ensured the viability during preservation and recovery processes, promoting liver function and ensuring optimal preservation. This was evidenced by increased oxygen consumption, decreased vascular resistance and edema. Ultimately, we show that using the optimized protocol, livers can be stored for 10 days with comparable vascular resistance and lactate levels to 5 days, outperforming the viability of time-matched cold stored livers as the current gold standard. This study represents a significant advancement in expanding organ availability through prolonged preservation and thereby revolutionizing transplant medicine.",,,

To further explore this concept for COVID-19, we constructed Adeno-associated viral (AAV) vectors encoding the human variable regions of the SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody, TRES6, fused to murine constant regions. An optimized vector construct was packaged in hepatotropic (AAV8) or myotropic (AAVMYO) AAV capsids and injected intravenously into syngeneic TRIANNI-mice. The highest TRES6 serum concentrations (511 µg/ml) were detected 24 weeks after injection of the myotropic vector particles and mean TRES6 serum concentrations remained above 100 µg/ml for at least one year. Anti-drug antibodies or TRES6-specific T cells were not detectable. After injection of the AAV8 particles, vector mRNA was detected in the liver, while the AAVMYO particles led to high vector mRNA levels in the heart and skeletal muscle. The analysis of the Fc-glycosylation pattern of the TRES6 serum antibodies revealed critical differences between the capsids that coincided with different binding activities to murine Fc-γ-receptors. Concomitantly, the vector-based immune prophylaxis led to protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection in K18-hACE2 mice.

Diagnoses comprise all KSHV-associated diseases (KAD): Kaposi sarcoma (KS), primary effusion lymphoma (PEL), KSHV-associated large cell lymphoma (KSHV-LCL), a type of multicentric Castleman disease (KSHV-MCD), and KSHV inflammatory cytokine syndrome (KICS). Participants originated from 22 different countries, providing the opportunity to obtain new near full-length sequences of a wide diversity of KSHV genomes. These include near full-length sequence of genomes with KSHV K1 subtypes A, B, C, and F as well as subtype E, for which no full sequence was previously available. High levels of recombination were observed. Fourteen individuals (18%) showed evidence of infection with multiple KSHV variants (from two to four unique genomes). Twenty-six comparisons of sequences, obtained from various sampling sites including PBMC, tissue biopsies, oral fluids, and effusions in the same participants, identified near complete genome conservation between different biological compartments. Polymorphisms were identified in coding and non-coding regions, including indels in the K3 and K15 genes and sequence inversions here reported for the first time. One such polymorphism in KSHV ORF46, specific to the KSHV K1 subtype E2, encoded a mutation in the leucine loop extension of the uracil DNA glycosylase that results in alteration of biochemical functions of this protein.

The lack of effective treatments associated with the absence of early symptoms highlights the need to search for new therapeutic targets for CCA. Sulfatides (STs), a type of sulfoglycosphingolipids, have been found in the biliary tract, with increased levels in CCA and other types of cancer. STs are involved in protein trafficking and cell adhesion as part of the lipid rafts of the plasma membrane. We aimed to study the role of STs in CCA by the genetic targeting of GAL3ST1, an enzyme involved in ST synthesis. We used the CRISPR-Cas9 system to generate ",,,

These positive responses to CAR T therapy have spurred biotech and big pharma companies to evaluate innovative production methods to increase patient access while maintaining adequate quality control and profitability. Autologous cellular therapies are, by definition, manufactured as single patient batches, and demand has soared for manufacturing facilities compliant with current Good Manufacturing Practice (cGMP) regulations. The use of a centralized production model is straining finite resources even in developed countries in North America and the European Union, and patient access is not feasible for most of the developing world.

Gradual rewarming during machine perfusion has proven effective in mitigating reperfusion injury and enhancing graft quality. Limited data exist on artificial oxygen carriers as an effective solution to meet the increasing metabolic demand with temperature changes. The aim of the present study was to assess the efficacy and safety of utilizing a hemoglobin-based oxygen carrier (HBOC) during the gradual rewarming of DCD rat livers. Liver grafts were procured after 30 min of warm ischemia. The effect of 90 min of oxygenated rewarming perfusion from ice cold temperatures (4 °C) to 37 °C with HBOC after cold storage was evaluated and the results were compared with cold storage alone. Reperfusion at 37 °C was performed to assess the post-preservation recovery. Gradual rewarming with HBOC significantly enhanced recovery, demonstrated by markedly lower lactate levels and reduced vascular resistance compared to cold-stored liver grafts. Increased bile production in the HBOC group was noted, indicating improved liver function and bile synthesis capacity. Histological examination showed reduced cellular damage and better tissue preservation in the HBOC-treated livers compared to those subjected to cold storage alone. This study suggests the safety of using HBOC during rewarming perfusion of rat livers as no harmful effect was detected. Furthermore, the viability assessment indicated improvement in graft function.",,,

In vivo, various levels of HT were added to high SBM diets and fed to largemouth bass (initial weight: 6.00 ± 0.03 g) for 56 days. Results showed that a high level of SBM led to the reduction in growth performance, as evidenced by decreased weight gain rate and impaired hepatic function. Dietary supplementation with HT (1.0 g/kg) improved growth performance of largemouth bass, accompanied by the enhancements in hepatic antioxidant capacity and glycolipid metabolism. In vitro, HT facilitated glucose utilization in hepatocytes and positively influenced the modulation of crucial genes within the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. Conversely, administration of LY294002 (a PI3K inhibitor) reversed the detrimental effects observed in hepatocytes exposed to high glucose levels. Overall, incorporating HT (1.0 g/kg) into the diet enhanced liver health and improved the absorption and utilization of SBM in largemouth bass, potentially achieved through modulation of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway.",Liu Y,Wufeng Chicheng Biotech Co.,zhangll@hqu.edu.cn.

Further, patients hospitalized because of HF with comorbid diabetes mellitus (DM) are at a significantly increased risk of death and rehospitalization. Results from the SOLOIST-WHF trial show that sotagliflozin lowered rates of readmission among hospitalized patients with HF and comorbid DM. However, it is unclear what the economic impact of the use of sotagliflozin would be on hospitals and health systems, particularly in an age where provider reimbursement is increasingly tied to value. To quantify the 1-year financial impact on US provider health systems of adopting sotagliflozin relative to standard of care (SoC) across different alternative payment models. This study created a 3-part decision tree model to quantify the financial impact of using sotagliflozin to treat patients hospitalized with HF in a US hospital setting. The model first estimated the clinical and economic outcomes of health systems with current SoC (no sotagliflozin) to treat US patients hospitalized for HF with comorbid DM. Then, using the results from the SOLOIST trial, the changes in clinical and economic outcomes with sotagliflozin adoption were modeled. Finally, the differences in health care utilization between sotagliflozin and SoC arms were translated to differences in health system reimbursement in the context of 3 common alternative payment models (APMs) in addition to the baseline fee-for-service (FFS) model: FFS with the Hospital Readmissions Reduction Program, the Bundled Payments for Care Improvement-Advanced program, and Accountable Care Organizations. A typical community hospital would have 83.4 patients per year on average with an index HF hospitalization with comorbid DM. The model predicted that sotagliflozin would reduce the probability of hospitalization, emergency department visits, and deaths by 29.3%, 38.5%, and 17.8%, respectively, compared with SoC. For hospitals not participating in APM programs, sotagliflozin resulted in a net loss of $92.94 per person ($7,754 per health system). Conversely, when accounting for provider health system participation in APMs, sotagliflozin adoption increased financial returns by $4,720 per person ($305,604 per health system) under the Hospital Readmissions Reduction Program, $1,200 per person ($100,106 per health system) for the Bundled Payments for Care Improvement-Advanced program, and $1,078 per person ($31,029 per health system) for Accountable Care Organizations. Based on the national average composition of APM reimbursement, sotagliflozin adoption resulted in a $1,576 increase in margin per patient with HF ($105,454 per health system). Although sotagliflozin adoption reduced health system revenue in an FFS payment model, it led to a net positive financial impact after accounting for APM bonus payments.",Sikirica S,Lexicon Pharmaceuticals,

P2X7 receptor (P2X7R) activation by extracellular ATP (eATP) causes a large MP release and affects their contents in a cell-specific fashion. We investigated MP release and functional impact in microglial cells from P2X7R-WT or P2X7R-KO mice, as well as mouse microglial cell lines characterized for high (N13-P2X7RHigh) or low (N13-P2X7RLow) P2X7R expression. P2X7R stimulation promoted release of a mixed MP population enriched with naked mitochondria. Released mitochondria were taken up and incorporated into the mitochondrial network of the recipient cells in a P2X7R-dependent fashion. NLRP3 and the P2X7R itself were also delivered to the recipient cells. Microparticle transfer increased the energy level of the recipient cells and conferred a pro-inflammatory phenotype. These data show that the P2X7R is a master regulator of intercellular organelle and MP trafficking in immune cells.",,,

Emerging data suggest that dysregulated CAR-driven T-cell activation causes T-cell dysfunction and therapeutic failure. To re-engage the precision of the endogenous T-cell response, we designed MHC-independent T-cell receptors (miTCR) by linking antibody variable domains to T-cell receptor constant chains. Using predictive modeling, we observed that this standard ""cut and paste"" approach to synthetic protein design resulted in myriad biochemical conflicts at the hybrid variable-constant domain interface. Through iterative modeling and sequence modifications, we developed structure-enhanced miTCRs which significantly improved receptor-driven T-cell function across multiple tumor models. We found that 41BB costimulation specifically prolonged miTCR T-cell persistence and enabled improved leukemic control in vivo compared with classic CAR T cells. Collectively, we have identified core features of hybrid receptor structure responsible for regulating function. Significance: Improving the durability of engineered T-cell immunotherapies is critical to enhancing efficacy. We used a structure-informed design to evolve improved miTCR function across several models. This work underscores the central role of synthetic receptor structure in T-cell function and provides a framework for improved receptor engineering.",,,
38976181,Electrical excitability of cancer cells-CELEX model updated.,2024-11-12,Cancer metastasis reviews,10.1007/s10555-024-10195-6,"The normal functioning of every cell in the body depends on its bioelectric properties and many diseases are caused by genetic and/or epigenetic dysregulation of the underlying ion channels. Metastasis, the main cause of death from cancer, is a complex multi-stage process in which cells break away from a primary tumour, invade the surrounding tissues, enter the circulation by encountering a blood vessel and spread around the body, ultimately lodging in distant organs and reproliferating to form secondary tumours leading to devastating organ failure. Such cellular behaviours are well known to involve ion channels. The CELEX model offers a novel insight to metastasis where it is the electrical excitation of the cancer cells that is responsible for their aggressive and invasive behaviour. In turn, the hyperexcitability is underpinned by concomitant upregulation of functional voltage-gated sodium channels and downregulation of voltage-gated potassium channels. Here, we update the in vitro and in vivo evidence in favour of the CELEX model for carcinomas. The results are unequivocal for the sodium channel. The potassium channel arm is also broadly supported by existing evidence although these data are complicated by the impact of the channels on the membrane potential and consequent secondary effects. Finally, consistent with the CELEX model, we show (i) that carcinomas are indeed electrically excitable and capable of generating action potentials and (ii) that combination of a sodium channel inhibitor and a potassium channel opener can produce a strong, additive anti-invasive effect. We discuss the possible clinical implications of the CELEX model in managing cancer.",,,m.djamgoz@imperial.ac.uk.

In this study, we characterized two murine embryonic clonal preadipocyte lines, EB5 and EB7, each displaying unique gene marker expression profiles. EB5 cells differentiate into brown adipocytes, whereas EB7 cells into brite (also known as beige) adipocytes. To draw a comprehensive comparison, we contrasted the gene expression patterns, adipogenic capacity, as well as carbohydrate and lipid metabolism of these cells to that of F442A, a well-known white preadipocyte and adipocyte model. We found that commitment to differentiation in both EB5 and EB7 cells can be induced by 3-Isobutyl-1-methylxanthine/dexamethasone (Mix/Dex) and staurosporine/dexamethasone (St/Dex) treatments. Additionally, the administration of rosiglitazone significantly enhances the brown and brite adipocyte phenotypes. Our data also reveal the involvement of a series of genes in the transcriptional cascade guiding adipogenesis, pinpointing GSK3β as a critical regulator for both EB5 and EB7 adipogenesis. In a developmental context, we observe that, akin to brown fat progenitors, brite fat progenitors make their appearance in murine development by 11-12 days of gestation or potentially earlier. This result contributes to our understanding of adipocyte lineage specification during embryonic development. In conclusion, EB5 and EB7 cell lines are valuable for research into adipocyte biology, providing insights into the differentiation and development of brown and beige adipocytes. Furthermore, they could be useful for the characterization of drugs targeting energy balance for the treatment of obesity and metabolic diseases.",,,

Bacterial pathogens accounted for 7.7 million deaths and deaths attributable to bacterial antibiotic resistance amounted to 1.3 million, describing a clear demand for novel antibiotics. Antibiotic development had its golden age in 1930-1960. Following failures in the screening of chemical libraries for novel antibiotics at the beginning of this century, the high cost of launching new antibiotics (estimated at US$ 1.4 billion per registered drug) and difficulties in achieving a return of investment for novel antibiotics, pharmaceutical industry has mostly left the field. The current Lilliput review analyses the question whether scientific or economic hurdles prevented the registration of new antibiotics. Scientifically, substantial progress has been achieved over recent years to define the chemical properties needed to overcome the permeation barrier in Gram-negative pathogens; in extending the chemical space of antibiotic candidates by full modular synthesis of suitable molecules; by extending bioprospecting to previously 'unculturable' bacteria or unusual bacteria; by attacking bacterial targets on the outer bacterial membrane; and by looking for support from structural biology, genomics, molecular genetics, phylogenetic analyses and deep machine learning approaches. However, these research activities were mostly conducted by academic researchers and biotech companies with limited financial resources. It thus seems that the development of new antibiotics, frequently described as the drying of the pipeline, is less limited by lack of scientific insight than by lack of the mobilization of the monetary resources needed to bring these discoveries to the market despite recent financial push and pull efforts of the public sector.",,,

The CFB in mean or median IENF density and in percentage of IENFs with axonal swellings was minimal and similar between groups at Month 9. Ritlecitinib treatment was also not associated with an imbalanced incidence of neurological and audiological adverse events.
