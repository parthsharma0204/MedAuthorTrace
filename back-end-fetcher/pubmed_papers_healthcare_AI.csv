Climate change disrupts ecological balances that have historically limited viral spillover events, creating novel interfaces between wildlife reservoirs and human populations. The coronavirus family presents particular concern due to its diversity, adaptability, and demonstrated capacity for cross-species transmission. With over 200 coronaviruses identified in bat populations alone, this vast reservoir of genetic diversity, combined with the family's propensity for recombination, creates substantial pandemic potential that climate disruption may further amplify. Long COVID has revealed another dimension of the coronavirus threat: the potential for significant chronic disease burden following acute infection. This complex multisystem condition affects a substantial portion of SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals, with mechanisms including viral persistence, autoimmunity, microclot formation, and mitochondrial dysfunction. Future projections suggest that climate change could increase global viral spillover risk by 30-45% by 2070, particularly in Southeast Asia, Central Africa, and parts of South America. Artificial intelligence offers promising tools for addressing these interconnected challenges through enhanced surveillance, accelerated therapeutic development, and optimized healthcare delivery.

However, estimating food leftovers through visual observation is time-consuming and biased. To tackle this issue, we have devised an efficient deep learning-based approach that promises to revolutionize how we estimate food leftovers. Our first step was creating the LeFoodSet dataset, a pioneering large-scale open dataset explicitly designed for estimating food leftovers. This dataset is unique in its ability to estimate leftover rates and types of food. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive dataset for this type of analysis. The dataset comprises 524 image pairs representing 34 Indonesian food categories, each with images captured before and after consumption. Our prediction models employed a combined visual feature extraction and late fusion approach utilizing soft parameter sharing. Here, we used multi-task (MT) models that simultaneously predict leftovers and food types in training. In the experiments, we tested the single task (ST) model, the ST Model with Ground Truth (ST-GT), the MT model, and the MT model with Inter-task Connection (MT-IC). Our AI-based models, particularly the MT and MT-IC models, have shown promising results, outperforming human observation in predicting leftover food. These findings show the best with the ResNet101 model, where the Mean Average Error (MAE) of leftover task and food classification accuracy task is 0.0801 and 90.44% in the MT Model and 0.0817 and 92.56% in the MT-IC Model, respectively. It is proved that the proposed solution has a bright future for AI-based approaches in medical and nursing applications.",,,

A total of 100 DSA examinations were conducted on 100 patients. The infrarenal abdominal aorta (AAI), common iliac arteries (CIA), and external iliac arteries (EIA) were independently evaluated by two experienced radiologists using a standardized 5-point grading scale. Dr-SAM analyzed the same DSA images, and its assessments were compared with the average stenosis grading provided by the radiologists. Diagnostic accuracy was evaluated using Cohen's kappa, specificity, sensitivity, and Wilcoxon signed-rank tests. Interobserver agreement between radiologists, which established the reference standard, was strong (Cohen's kappa: CIA right = 0.95, CIA left = 0.94, EIA right = 0.98, EIA left = 0.98, AAI = 0.79). Dr-SAM showed high agreement with radiologist consensus for CIA (κ = 0.93 right, 0.91 left), moderate agreement for EIA (κ = 0.79 right, 0.76 left), and fair agreement for AAI (κ = 0.70). Dr-SAM demonstrated excellent specificity (up to 1.0) and robust sensitivity (0.67-0.83). Wilcoxon tests revealed no significant differences between Dr-SAM and radiologist grading (p > 0.05). Dr-SAM proved to be an accurate and efficient tool for vascular assessment, with the potential to streamline diagnostic workflows and reduce variability in stenosis grading.

40384019,Stratifying Risk for Postpartum Depression at Time of Hospital Discharge.,,The American journal of psychiatry,10.1176/appi.ajp.20240381,"Postpartum depression (PPD) is a major contributor to postpartum morbidity and mortality. Beyond efforts at routine screening, risk stratification models could enable more targeted interventions in settings with limited resources. The authors sought to develop and estimate the performance of a generalizable risk stratification model for PPD in patients without a history of depression, using information collected as part of routine clinical care. The authors conducted a retrospective cohort study of all individuals who delivered between 2017 and 2022 in one of two large academic medical centers and six community hospitals. An elastic net model was constructed and externally validated to predict PPD, defined as having a mood disorder, an antidepressant prescription, or a positive screen on the postpartum Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale. Predictors used included sociodemographic factors, medical history, and prenatal depression screening information, all of which were known before discharge from the delivery hospitalization. The cohort included 29,168 individuals; 2,696 (9.2%) met at least one criterion for postpartum depression in the 6 months following delivery. In the external validation data, the model had good discrimination and remained well calibrated: the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.721 (95% CI=0.709, 0.736), and the Brier calibration score was 0.087 (95% CI=0.083, 0.091). At a specificity of 90%, the positive predictive value was 28.8% (95% CI=26.7, 30.8), and the negative predictive value was 92.2% (95% CI=91.8, 92.7). These findings demonstrate that a simple machine-learning model can be used to stratify the risk for PPD before delivery hospitalization discharge. This tool could help identify patients within a practice at the highest risk and facilitate individualized postpartum care planning for the prevention of, screening for, and management of PPD at the start of the postpartum period and potentially the onset of symptoms.",,,

The study involved 70 patients with RRMS and 44 healthy controls. Neurological and MRI assessments were performed, and cognitive performance was assessed via the Brief Repeatable Battery of Neuropsychological Tests (BRB-N). To assess the glymphatic function, we calculated the choroid plexus volume (CPV) and diffusion tensor imaging along perivascular spaces (DTI-ALPS) index. Multivariable linear regression analyses were used to examine correlations between glymphatic dysfunction and MRI-derived brain damage metrics. Additionally, we utilised random forest analysis to identify predictors of Co-I and assessed the mediating role of DTI-ALPS. Patients with RRMS, particularly those with Co-I, exhibited a low DTI-ALPS index and large CPV. A lower DTI-ALPS index was associated with longer disease duration, greater disability, larger lesion volume (LV), mean diffusivity (MD), and CPV, as well as lower fractional anisotropy (FA) (all FDR-p < 0.05). Moreover, DTI-ALPS mediated 27.21 % and 43.75 % of CPV effects on information processing speed and visuospatial memory, respectively. Random forest analysis indicated that lower education (relative importance [RI] = 100 %), higher CPV (RI = 95.8 %), lower DTI-ALPS index (RI = 80.7 %), higher MD (RI = 61.3 %), lower FA (RI = 60.5 %), older age (RI = 54.6 %), and higher EDSS score (RI = 45.4 %) are predictors of Co-I. The study implied that glymphatic dysfunction may contribute to brain structural damage, clinical disability, and cognitive impairment in RRMS, indicating that glymphatic dysfunction may play a key role in the pathogenesis of RRMS.",Ai K,Deparment of Clinical and Technical Support,ery_zhangiing@lzu.edu.cn.

While Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems hold promise as a solution, they have not been designed to accommodate the sensory and cognitive changes typical of aging individuals. The current study investigates the use of an AI-powered communication device for the assessment of neuropsychological tests to an older adult population. Twenty-four (twelve females) older adult participants completed three memory tasks using the AI device: logical memory, poem recall, and the backward and sequencing digit span tests. Significant negative correlations were found between the age of the participants and performance on the Logical memory and digit span tests. The AI device effectively identified age-related memory changes comparable to those observed with human administrators. Implementing this technology in healthcare offers several advantages: alleviating healthcare professionals' workload, improving standard of care by reaching underserved populations, and facilitating continuous screening for early identification of prodromal stages of neurodegenerative diseases.",,,d.aguilarramirez@uleth.ca.

Digital health,10.1016/j.landig.2025.02.002,"CT attenuation correction (CTAC) scans are routinely obtained during cardiac perfusion imaging, but currently only used for attenuation correction and visual calcium estimation. We aimed to develop a novel artificial intelligence (AI)-based approach to obtain volumetric measurements of chest body composition from CTAC scans and to evaluate these measures for all-cause mortality risk stratification. We applied AI-based segmentation and image-processing techniques on CTAC scans from a large international image-based registry at four sites (Yale University, University of Calgary, Columbia University, and University of Ottawa), to define the chest rib cage and multiple tissues. Volumetric measures of bone, skeletal muscle, subcutaneous adipose tissue, intramuscular adipose tissue (IMAT), visceral adipose tissue (VAT), and epicardial adipose tissue (EAT) were quantified between automatically identified T5 and T11 vertebrae. The independent prognostic value of volumetric attenuation and indexed volumes were evaluated for predicting all-cause mortality, adjusting for established risk factors and 18 other body composition measures via Cox regression models and Kaplan-Meier curves. The end-to-end processing time was less than 2 min per scan with no user interaction. Between 2009 and 2021, we included 11 305 participants from four sites participating in the REFINE SPECT registry, who underwent single-photon emission computed tomography cardiac scans. After excluding patients who had incomplete T5-T11 scan coverage, missing clinical data, or who had been used for EAT model training, the final study group comprised 9918 patients. 5451 (55%) of 9918 participants were male and 4467 (45%) of 9918 participants were female. Median follow-up time was 2·48 years (IQR 1·46-3·65), during which 610 (6%) patients died. High VAT, EAT, and IMAT attenuation were associated with an increased all-cause mortality risk (adjusted hazard ratio 2·39, 95% CI 1·92-2·96; p<0·0001, 1·55, 1·26-1·90; p<0·0001, and 1·30, 1·06-1·60; p=0·012, respectively). Patients with high bone attenuation were at reduced risk of death (0·77, 0·62-0·95; p=0·016). Likewise, high skeletal muscle volume index was associated with a reduced risk of death (0·56, 0·44-0·71; p<0·0001).

This study presents Dilated Y-Block-based Feature Summarized Pyramidal Attention Network (DY-FSPAN), a deep learning framework designed for robust feature extraction and classification. The architecture incorporates Y-blocks and attention mechanisms to enhance spatial feature representation while maintaining receptive field coherence. The proposed model achieves a classification accuracy of 98.5 %, surpassing existing approaches such as convolutional block attention networks, adversarial learning models, and multi-output 3D CNNs. To validate the efficacy of DY-FSPAN, we conduct an extensive experiment, including comparative benchmarking against state-of-the-art methods, robustness assessments, and ablation studies. The model's structural improvements are tested through various configurations to assess the impact of key components, confirming the contribution of attention mechanisms to performance enhancement. Grad-CAM analysis was employed to visualize learned feature maps, highlighting the model's focus on diagnostically relevant regions, thereby improving trust in AI-driven medical decision-making. From an explainable AI perspective, the proposed framework achieves superior classification accuracy and enhances interpretability, addressing a crucial requirement in medical imaging applications. The qualitative and quantitative analyses demonstrate that DY-FSPAN effectively localizes disease-specific features, making it a suitable tool for clinical use.

This study evaluated four distinct GPT-4-based approaches for mapping local medical terminologies to SNOMED CT: baseline, prompt-engineered, fine-tuned, and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). Using 1,200 diagnostic terms from a Korean hospital, we assessed the models' accuracy and error rates. The RAG model achieved the highest performance with a 96.2% valid SNOMED CT term match rate and a 57.6% overall exact match rate, surpassing the fine-tuned model (69.2% valid term match, 47.2% exact match). Error analysis showed that the RAG model also minimized structural errors to 14%, significantly lower than other models. While the fine-tuned and RAG models struggled with specificity, they showed promise for improving automated mapping and Named Entity Recognition (NER) tasks in clinical settings. This study highlights the potential of AI-human collaboration for enhancing autocoding and data standardization in healthcare.

With the advancement of artificial intelligence, automatic CDC is now achievable through deep learning techniques. While existing research has shown promising results, more effective and accurate classification of long clinical documents is still desired. To address this, we propose a new model called the Enhanced Effective Convolutional Attention Network (EECAN), which incorporates a Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE) Inception module to improve feature representation by adaptively recalibrating channel-wise feature responses. This architecture introduces an Encoder and Attention-Based Clinical Document Classification (EAB-CDC) strategy, which utilizes sum-pooling and multi-layer attention mechanisms to extract salient features from clinical document representations. This study proposes EECAN (Enhanced Effective Convolutional Attention Network) as the overall model architecture and EAB-CDC (Encoder and Attention-Based Clinical Document Classification) as a core strategy conducted in EECAN. EAB-CDC is not a standalone model but a functional part applied to the architecture for discriminative feature extraction by sum-pooling and multi-layer attention mechanisms. With this integrated design, EECAN can transform multi-label clinical texts' general and label-specific contexts without losing information. Our empirical study, conducted on benchmark datasets such as MIMIC-III and MIMIC-III-50, demonstrates that the proposed EECAN model outperforms several existing deep learning approaches, achieving AUC scores of 99.70% and 99.80% using sum-pooling and multi-layer attention, respectively.

In literature, miRNAs have been used for the survival prediction of different types of cancers using AI. Although AI is useful for diagnosis and prognosis prediction of cancer, however, a major criticism of incorporating it into medical fields is that it is essentially a mechanistically uninterpretable opaque ""black box"", and hence it may not have the required level of accountability, transparency, and reliability in decisions of cancer diagnosis and prognosis for their adoption in clinical settings. Therefore, there is need to develop intelligent models which may explain their prediction so that they may be reliably used by the clinicians. As dysregulated miRNAs are reported to cause cancer metastasis hence, they can play role in survival of patient. Therefore, there is needed to develop ML based techniques which may automatically indicate specific miRNAs involved in survival of patients. In this research, Machine Learning and Explainable AI (XAI) based models have been developed for survival prediction of Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma (HNSC) patients using miRNA sequences and clinical datasets. miRNAs dataset contains the data of 485 HNSC patients and clinical dataset contains data of 528 patients. The proposed XAI based model explains its prediction by showing the specific miRNA sequences involved in survival of the patients to demonstrate its reliability to be used by clinicians for therapeutic decisions.

40378109,Tools and methods for cataract recognition in low-resource settings: A narrative review.,,PLOS global public health,10.1371/journal.pgph.0004619,"Cataracts are a leading cause of global blindness, with many low-resource populations having poor access to eye care. While much is known regarding surgical access and outcomes, less is understood about the initial detection of operable cataracts in low-resource settings. We performed a comprehensive literature review on existing and emerging cataract screening methods in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). The search keywords were ""cataract detection, diagnosis, assessment, and evaluation in low- and middle- income countries"". 1,825 articles were identified and 62 were selected for final inclusion comprising reviews, meta-analyses, and original research studies. Only 12 studies proposed new cataract screening methods for low-income settings. We extracted data on the efficacy and cost-efficiency of these novel methods and compared them to existing conventional cataract diagnosis methods. 8 out of 12 original research works developed novel devices or imaging modalities such as low-cost ophthalmoscopes and retinal cameras for cataract detection. 7 studies leveraged non-ophthalmologist staff to test their methods, suggesting a potential benefit of employing additional personnel for cataract screening. 8 studies utilized tele-ophthalmology and artificial intelligence (AI) platforms with high cataract detection accuracy. Overall, rates of cataract diagnosis in LMICs can be increased through a multifaceted strategy involving low-cost, portable devices operated by local healthcare workers and augmented by telehealth or AI approaches. Such efforts can aid in addressing the disparity between cataract diagnosis and surgical intervention in low-resource environments. However, improvements in research infrastructure are needed to support such efforts and the ability to thoroughly evaluate new innovations.",,,

We utilized a nationwide administrative database from Taiwan and conducted propensity score matching (PSM) to investigate the association between sarcopenia and major postoperative complications. This retrospective cohort study analyzed data from the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database from 2016 to 2020. Patients who underwent elective cholecystectomy under general anesthesia for gallstone disease were included. They were categorized into two groups: those with sarcopenia and those without. The cohorts were matched at a 1:4 ratio using PSM. PSM yielded a final cohort of 13,330 surgical patients (10,664 without sarcopenia and 2666 with sarcopenia). Multivariate logistic regression demonstrated that sarcopenia was significantly associated with higher 30 day mortality (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 2.26, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.61-3.18) and major complications, including acute renal failure (aOR = 1.71, 95% CI 1.02-2.84), pneumonia (aOR = 1.68, 95% CI 1.22-2.31), stroke (aOR = 1.13, 95% CI 1.06-1.57), and overall complications (aOR = 1.23, 95% CI 1.07-1.41). Sarcopenia also increased the risk of 90-day mortality (aOR = 2.09, 95% CI 1.58-2.76) and 90-day major complications, including acute renal failure (aOR = 1.61, 95% CI 1.01-2.56), pneumonia (aOR = 1.70, 95% CI 1.30-2.21), stroke (aOR = 1.28, 95% CI 1.04-1.58), and overall complications (aOR = 1.24, 95% CI 1.09-1.41). We found that sarcopenia is an independent risk factor for increased postoperative complications and mortality following cholecystectomy.

However, their performance compared to nurses and across different AI chatbots, particularly in the field of sexual health, remains understudied. This study evaluated the performance of three AI chatbots - two prompt-tuned (Alice and Azure) and one standard chatbot (ChatGPT by OpenAI) - in providing sexual health information on questions that experienced sexual health nurses could correctly answer. We analysed 195 anonymised sexual health questions received by the Melbourne Sexual Health Centre phone line. A panel of experts in a blinded order using a consensus-based approach evaluated responses to these questions from nurses and the three AI chatbots. Performance was assessed based on overall correctness and five specific measures: guidance, accuracy, safety, ease of access, and provision of necessary information. We conducted subgroup analyses for clinic-specific (e.g., opening hours) and general sexual health questions and a sensitivity analysis excluding questions that Azure could not answer. Alice demonstrated the highest overall correctness (85.2%; 95% confidence interval (CI), 82.1-88.0%), followed by Azure (69.3%; 95% CI, 65.3-73.0%) and ChatGPT (64.8%; 95% CI, 60.7-68.7%).

However, this vulnerable population may not adequately weigh risks against benefits when participating in research, forming an ethical concern, yet little is known about how YLWH perceive these risks and benefits. To inform research-related policies and procedures, we sought perspectives of Kenyan YLWH, their caregivers and subject matter experts (SMEs) on risks and benefits of participation in research in a setting with a high burden of youth HIV infection. We conducted a qualitative inquiry on identifying, enrolling, and protecting YLWH (age 10-24 years) in research using semi-structured interviews with YLWH involved in research, their caregivers, YLWH with no prior research experience, and other SMEs at the AMPATH care and research sites in western Kenya. Transcripts were thematically analyzed and emerging themes derived to characterize perspectives of each group on risks and benefits of engaging YLWH in research. Interviews were conducted with 40 YLWH (50% female; median age 17.5 years), 20 caregivers (70% female), and 39 SMEs [healthcare providers (N = 10), community leaders (N = 10) community advisory board members (N = 4), IRB experts (N = 5), clinical researchers (N = 6), social science researchers (N = 4) and laboratory experts (N = 1).] Participants in all groups identified accidental disclosure of HIV status, stigma and discrimination, risks of blood draws, mental health effects, and coercion due to study compensation as risks of research involvement. Benefits fell into 5 categories: clinical, informational, personal, future and community or household benefits. Benefits included access to health care, learning about HIV, gaining hope and community, improving HIV care, and reducing stigma. All participant groups largely held similar views; however, caregivers were the only group to identify misuse of study compensation as a risk, and YLWH less frequently cited clinical benefits. These findings suggest that participants commonly cite indirect risks and benefits of research participation, yet these are often excluded from institutional guidelines for consent documentation. Researchers should consider including indirect risks and benefits, such as the risk of stigma or the benefit of gaining knowledge and community, to study documentation.",Aluoch J; Koros H; Ashimosi C; Biegon W; Munyoro D; Lidweye J; Nyagaya J; Naanyu V,Academic Model Providing Access to Healthcare (AMPATH),rachel.vreeman@mssm.edu.

The PLASMIC Score was developed to identify individuals with thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP), a TMA subtype characterized by severe ADAMTS13 deficiency (< 10%), using 7 commonly available laboratory variables and aspects of the patient's medical history. This study aimed to assess the distribution of PLASMIC Scores in patients with known aHUS, and evaluate the utility of the PLASMIC Score in the diagnostic pathway of aHUS in patients with confirmed TMA. Data from eculizumab (NCT01194973) and ravulizumab (NCT02949128) clinical trials were utilized to calculate and evaluate PLASMIC Score distribution in aHUS patients. Real-world patient-level data from the PINC AI™ Healthcare Database (PHD) were used to evaluate the performance of the PLASMIC Score in identifying aHUS in patients with documented TMA diagnoses and renal impairment (primary analysis population; n = 110), and subsequent sensitivity analyses were performed in alternative populations.

While digital tools like mobile apps, telehealth reminders, and AI-driven interventions have shown global success in managing hypertension, their adoption in Asia remains limited due to cultural dietary habits, disparities in digital literacy and access, and fragmented healthcare infrastructure present unique barriers to equitable implementation. This mini review examines key challenges and opportunities in applying digital health interventions to improve hypertension adherence in the region. We identify five critical barriers: (1) difficulty in monitoring dietary sodium intake due to limited practical tools and regional dietary diversity, (2) low digital engagement among older adults, who are disproportionately affected by hypertension, (3) lack of interoperability between digital platforms and healthcare systems, (4) a fragmented regulatory landscape that hinders consistent oversight and adoption, and (5) challenges in sustaining long-term user engagement. Achieving meaningful impact will require cross-sector collaboration to standardize data protocols, improve regulatory alignment, ensure affordability, and support user-centered design. As evidence for outcome-based effectiveness grows, digital tools can be integrated into national strategies to reduce cardiovascular disease risk and healthcare costs.

However, evidence for its association with mental health is mixed. The present longitudinal study examined whether medical students with higher ERA scores report better mental health over one year and whether this effect is mediated by a higher perceived availability of social support. Longitudinal mediation analyses were conducted with data from 986 medical students in Switzerland who completed questionnaires at two time points, one year apart. While ERA at T1 was not directly associated with mental health issues and burnout at T2, it predicted greater social support availability at T2, which in turn predicted fewer mental health issues and lower burnout. Exploratory analyses revealed that although ERA increased social support, it also predicted higher habitual avoidance coping, which was negatively related to mental health. Overall, this study sheds light on both positive and negative indirect pathways through which ERA may affect mental health in future healthcare professionals. These insights highlight the need for careful consideration of ERA intervention studies, addressing both positive and negative influences on mental health.",,,nils.sommer@unibe.ch.

This study aims to evaluate and compare the predictive accuracy of AI algorithms in predicting the mode of delivery (vaginal or cesarean) using routinely collected antepartum data from electronic health records (EHRs). A retrospective dataset of 16,651 pregnancies monitored at St. Mary's Hospital, London, over a four-year period was utilized. The dataset included 12,639 vaginal deliveries and 4012 unplanned cesarean deliveries, with 92 variables recorded for each patient. Five machine learning algorithms were evaluated: XGBoost, AdaBoost, random forest, decision tree, and multi-layer perceptron (MLP) classifier. A comprehensive feature importance analysis was conducted on the trained models to identify the key predictors influencing the mode of delivery classification. All five models demonstrated excellent predictive performance, with AdaBoost and XGBoost achieving nearly identical top scores across most metrics: ROC-AUC (90 %), accuracy (89 %), PR-AUC (83 %), and F1 score (88 %) Feature importance analysis highlighted the most predictive factors for mode of delivery. Maternal age demonstrated the highest importance, followed by gravida and maternal height.

A total of 72 participants (mean age 38.3 ± 15.4 years, 40 males) prospectively enrolled in this single-center, cross-sectional study underwent cine scans using standard breath-holding (BH) cine and FB AI MOCO cine at 3.0 Tesla. The image quality of the cine images was evaluated with a 5-point Ordinal Likert scale based on blood-pool to myocardium contrast, endocardial edge definition, and artifacts, and overall quality score was calculated by the equal weight average of all three criteria, apparent signal to noise ratio (aSNR), estimated contrast to noise ratio (eCNR) were assessed. Biventricular functional parameters including Left Ventricular (LV), Right Ventricular (RV) End-Diastolic Volume (EDV), End-Systolic Volume (ESV), Stroke Volume (SV), Ejection Fraction (EF), and LV End-Diastolic Mass (LVEDM) were also assessed. Comparison between two sequences was assessed using paired t-test and Wilcoxon signed-rank test, correlation using Pearson correlation. The agreement of quantitative parameters was assessed using intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and Bland-Altman analysis. P < 0.05 was statistically significant. The total acquisition time of the entire stack for FB AI MOCO cine (14.7 s ± 1.9 s) was notably shorter than that for standard BH cine (82.6 s ± 11.9 s, P < 0.001). The aSNR between FB AI MOCO cine and standard BH cine has no significantly difference (76.7 ± 20.7 vs. 79.8 ± 20.7, P = 0.193). The eCNR of FB AI MOCO cine was higher than standard BH cine (191.6 ± 54.0 vs. 155.8 ± 68.4, P < 0.001), as was the scores of blood-pool to myocardium contrast (4.6 ± 0.5 vs. 4.4 ± 0.6, P = 0.003). Qualitative scores including endocardial edge definition (4.2 ± 0.5 vs. 4.3 ± 0.7, P = 0.123), artifact presence (4.3 ± 0.6 vs. 4.1 ± 0.8, P = 0.085), and overall image quality (4.4 ± 0.4 vs. 4.3 ± 0.6, P = 0.448), showed no significant differences between the two methods. Representative RV and LV functional parameters - including RVEDV (102.2 (86.4, 120.4) ml vs. 104.0 (88.5, 120.3) ml, P = 0.294), RVEF (31.0 ± 11.1 % vs. 31.2 ± 11.0 %, P = 0.570), and LVEDV (106.2 (86.7, 131.3) ml vs. 105.8 (84.4, 130.3) ml, P = 0.450) - also did not differ significantly between the two methods. Strong correlations (r > 0.900) and excellent agreement (ICC > 0.900) were found for all biventricular functional parameters between the two sequences.

The objective of this systematic review is to determine the role of AIDAs in educating and empowering patients, particularly those from underrepresented populations. We conducted a comprehensive systematic review following PRISMA guidelines to explore the potential for AIDAs to address healthcare inequalities and promote patient education and empowerment. From 1078 abstracts screened, 21 articles were suitable for inclusion, all of which utilized chatbots. Three main themes of studies were identified. Fourteen studies focused on enhancing patient education, four studies investigated whether chatbots can improve the accessibility of urological literature and three studies explored chatbots role in providing lifestyle guidance. While chatbots demonstrated great potential as educational and lifestyle support tools, current research found mixed accuracy and a tendency for them to produce unreliable information. In terms of accessibility, chatbots were able to effectively enhance readability and translate literature, potentially bridging language, and literacy barriers. Through chatbots, AIDAs show strong potential to enhance urological education and empower underrepresented communities. However, chatbots must show greater consistency in accuracy before they can be confidently relied upon in clinical contexts. Further research evaluating chatbots' efficacy in clinical settings, especially with underrepresented groups, would enable greater understanding of their role in improving patient inclusivity, empowerment, and education.",,,

Understanding health provider perceptions of barriers and facilitators that influence implementation can optimize adoption and sustainment of health systems interventions. The Data-informed Stepped Care (DiSC) study was a cluster randomized controlled trial of a stepped care intervention in 24 HIV care facilities in Kenya. At each visit, providers used an assessment tool to allocate AYLHIV to services according to level of need. Stable clients were allocated to differentiated service delivery (DSD) with less frequent visits. Intensified services, including behavioral counseling, were provided for those with greater likelihood of loss to follow-up, mental health issues, or viral non-suppression. We conducted focus group discussions (FGDs) with providers across 12 intervention sites between January-February 2023. FGDs used a semi-structured interview guide, grounded in the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research, which were audio-recorded and transcribed. Transcripts were analyzed using a team-based rapid turnaround approach to characterize key determinants influencing adoption, reach, and fidelity. Providers were enthusiastic about, and quick to adopt, the DiSC intervention. They found the DiSC tool easy to use and felt it provided a relative advantage by improving service delivery efficiency and prioritizing time with higher need AYLHIV. Providers noted the importance of tool flexibility to align with changing national guidelines. They expressed concerns about compatibility with existing workflows at facilities exclusively using electronic medical record (EMR) systems, suggesting EMR integration will be needed for intervention sustainment. AYLHIV eligible for DSD benefited from clinic visit intervals that aligned with the school calendar, which posed a challenge for reaching AYLHIV in more intensive steps. Provider collective efficacy was important in consistent implementation of DiSC and was facilitated by continuous quality improvement meetings, access to knowledge and information, and perceived intervention effectiveness. Supportive leadership was an important driver of implementation success, through availing space for mental health counseling sessions and time for client-provider interactions outside standard operating hours. Consideration of alignment with national policy, integration into clinic workflows, school schedules, and leadership engagement, will be important for sustained use of differentiated care interventions.

Whilst cell cycle phase and the chromatin context largely dictate which repair pathway is utilised to restore damaged DNA, it has been recently shown that nuclear actin filaments play a major role in clustering DNA breaks to facilitate DSBR by homologous recombination (HR). However, the mechanism with which nuclear actin and the different actin nucleating factors regulate HR is unclear. Interestingly, patients with biallelic mutations in the actin nucleating factor DIAPH1 exhibit a striking overlap of clinical features with the HR deficiency disorders, Nijmegen Breakage Syndrome (NBS) and Warsaw Breakage Syndrome (WABS). This suggests that DIAPH1 may play a role in regulating HR and that some of the clinical deficits associated with DIAPH1 mutations may be caused by an underlying DSBR defect. In keeping with this clinical similarity, we demonstrate that cells from DIAL (DIAPH1 Loss-of-function) Syndrome patients display an HR repair defect comparable to loss of NBS1. Moreover, we show that this DSBR defect is also observed in a subset of patients with Baraitser-Winter Cerebrofrontofacial (BWCFF) syndrome associated with mutations in ACTG1 (γ-actin) but not ACTB (β-actin). Lastly, we demonstrate that DIAPH1 and γ-actin promote HR-dependent repair by facilitating the relocalisation of the MRE11/RAD50/NBS1 complex to sites of DNA breaks to initiate end-resection.

However, challenges like low completion rates, inadequate bowel preparation, high conversion to OE, and discrepancies in findings remain. Accurate polyp size measurement in CCE is essential to avoid unnecessary procedures due to size overestimation. This retrospective study analysed real-world data to compare polyp size measurements between CCE, OE, and histopathology (HP) and assess the impact on the need for further procedures. Data from 2508 participants across 12 UK centres were analysed, with 4898 polyps identified via CCE. Polyps were matched with OE and HP reports based on size, location, morphology, sequence, and count, including those meeting ≥3 criteria. Regional data from Scotland and England were compared. Half of the CCE patients required follow-up OE, with 29 % undergoing colonoscopy. Among these, 32 % required OE for polypectomy, and 18 % due to incomplete CCE. In these cases, CCE overestimated polyp size by an average of 2.5 mm compared to HP and 2.7 mm compared to OE, leading to 17.3 % of potentially deferrable procedures. one in six participants had a further procedure reflecting the overestimation of polyp size. AI advancement could enhance polyp measurement accuracy and reduce unnecessary procedures whilst improving the cost-effectiveness of CCE.",Ibrahim H; Jardine R; Mcgreevy C; Hunt C; Nair SS; Nizar ZY; ,Department of Surgery; ; Department of Gastroenterology,brian.lei@uhcw.nhs.uk.
40368671,Impact of aspirin therapy on progression of thoracic and abdominal aortic aneurysms.,,Atherosclerosis,10.1016/j.atherosclerosis.2025.119224,"Aortic aneurysms, including abdominal (AAA) and thoracic (TAA), pose significant challenges due to their rupture risk and complex pathophysiology. While aspirin has been proposed to manage aneurysm progression, evidence remains limited. This retrospective, single-center study used AI-driven methods to examine the association between aspirin therapy and aneurysm growth. The study, at the University of Kentucky Healthcare, utilized de-identified electronic health record data from 2010 to 2023. To evaluate platelet count changes, Cohort 1 included patients with AAA or TAA and matched healthy controls. To evaluate aortic diameter, Cohort 2 included AAA or TAA patients who had at least two imaging studies. Extraction of aortic diameters utilized an advanced AI-based natural language processing (NLP) algorithm to identify and extract relevant text strings related to aortic dimensions. Multivariable-adjusted linear regression analyses assessed the impact of aspirin on aneurysm progression. Cohort 1 included 11,538 participants: 5774 controls, 3439 with AAA, and 2325 with TAA. Platelet counts were significantly lower in patients with aortic aneurysms compared to controls, though they were not considered thrombocytopenic. Cohort 2 included 302 AAA and 141 TAA patients. Subgroup analysis revealed that aspirin use was associated with increased AAA progression in females with small aneurysms (<50 mm). Further, aspirin therapy showed no significant impact on the annualized change in aneurysm diameter for TAA or for males with AAA. Our findings suggest aspirin's effectiveness varies by sex and potentially aneurysm size, underscoring the need for further research to refine antiplatelet therapy guidelines for aortic aneurysms.",,,whitehe@uky.edu.

Developing a widely accepted mobile wellness app is imperative for advancing personalized wellness interventions. The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the Aspire2B wellness app (powered by Salus Optima), designed to exceed industry standards for participant engagement by incorporating evidence-based behavior change strategies and to assess its acceptability (eg, liking the face scan) and utility (eg, willing to use the face scan technology for other health insights) as a digital health solution. Participants aged 18-65 years, who were smartphone and fitness tracker users, were recruited in the United States during March-May 2022. Participants received US $5 compensation for downloading the app, with no further incentive for usage. Following completion of onboarding (ie, survey questions about lifestyle behaviors), participants were placed in either a nutrition, sleep, or fitness 4-week challenge. During the challenge, participants used various app features at their own will, such as a facial scan for wellness insights (eg, heart rate and biological age), recipes, and workout videos. These interactions with the app were cumulatively evaluated as engagement metrics. Participants were also asked to answer offboarding questions to evaluate any changes to lifestyle behaviors and experience using the app features (eg, acceptability of face scan experience). Out of the 398 people who created an account, 85.9% (342/398) completed onboarding and a face scan. Following this, 74.9% (298/398) of users completed additional survey questions about current wellness behaviors. Notably, interaction with the app was relatively stable from week 2 to 4 (173/398, 43.5%), outperforming industry standards by roughly 3×. In addition, on average, participants completed 2.1-2.7 face scans per week, with approximately 7% (24/342) of participants maintaining regular use of face scan technology for 4 weeks. In users who completed offboarding questions, 88.8% (111/125) found Aspire2B credible, 64.8% (81/125) liked the face scan experience, 7.2% (9/125) disliked the face scan experience, and 83.2% (104/125) said they would use face scan technology for other insights into their health. These findings highlight strong initial engagement with Aspire2B, followed by significant sustained user engagement over a 4-week period. Furthermore, users indicated high levels of credibility and willingness to use face scan technology for wellness insights.

Despite global efforts, Kenya continues to report high maternal mortality rates of over 350 deaths per 100,000 live births and a neonatal mortality rate of 21 per 1,000 live births. Artificial Intelligence (AI)-enabled maternal healthcare interventions, such as Obstetric Point-of-Care Ultrasound (OPOCUS) and AI-driven SMS intervention on Promoting Mothers through Pregnancy and Postpartum (PROMPTS), offer innovative solutions to improve early detection, diagnosis, and maternal health-seeking behaviors. However, there is limited evidence on their usability, feasibility, and impact on maternal and neonatal outcomes. This study aims to assess the implementation, user experiences, and impact of OPOCUS and PROMPTS on maternal and neonatal health outcomes in Kenya. Specifically, it evaluates their effectiveness in reducing maternal complications, improving antenatal and postnatal care utilization, and enhancing clinical decision-making while identifying potential barriers to adoption and scalability. This mixed-methods, cross-sectional study will be conducted in ten counties in Kenya that have integrated AI-based maternal healthcare interventions. Quantitative data will be collected from health facility records, national health databases (KHIS), and structured surveys, while qualitative data will be gathered through key informant interviews (KIIs) with healthcare providers and policymakers, as well as focus group discussions (FGDs) with maternal health service users. Statistical analyses will include comparative pre- and post-AI implementation assessments, with thematic analysis for qualitative insights. The study will generate empirical evidence on the feasibility, effectiveness, and barriers to AI integration in maternal health services. Findings will inform policy recommendations, enhance AI-assisted maternal healthcare design, and support the scaling of AI-driven interventions to improve maternal and neonatal health outcomes in Kenya and other low-resource settings. AI-based maternal health interventions hold promise for reducing maternal mortality, improving diagnostic accuracy, and enhancing health-seeking behaviors. However, their success depends on user experiences, healthcare system readiness, and policy alignment.

We retrospectively collected 41 patients with non-removal dental hardware who underwent non-contrast head and neck CT prior to radiotherapy. All images were reconstructed with standard reconstruction algorithm (SRA), and were additionally processed with both conventional MAC and AI-MAC. The image quality of SRA, MAC and AI-MAC were compared by qualitative scoring on a 5-point scale, with scores ≥ 3 considered interpretable. This was followed by a quantitative evaluation, including signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and artefact index (Idxartefact). Organ contouring accuracy was quantified via calculating the dice similarity coefficient (DSC) and hausdorff distance (HD) for oral cavity and teeth, using the clinically accepted contouring as reference. Moreover, the treatment planning dose distribution for oral cavity was assessed. AI-MAC yielded superior qualitative image quality as well as quantitative metrics, including SNR and Idxartefact, to SRA and MAC. The image interpretability significantly improved from 41.46% for SRA and 56.10% for MAC to 92.68% for AI-MAC (p < 0.05). Compared to SRA and MAC, the best DSC and HD for both oral cavity and teeth were obtained on AI-MAC (all p < 0.05). No significant differences for dose distribution were found among the three image sets. AI-MAC outperforms conventional MAC in metal artefact reduction, achieving superior image quality with high image interpretability for patients with dental hardware undergoing head and neck CT. Furthermore, the use of AI-MAC improves the accuracy of organ contouring while providing consistent dose calculation against metal artefacts in radiotherapy. AI-MAC is a novel deep learning-based technique for reducing metal artefacts on CT. This in-vivo study first demonstrated its capability of reducing metal artefacts while preserving organ visualization, as compared with conventional MAC.",Zhong S; Zhang G,United Imaging Healthcare,

It was unclear whether these differences in weight gain and body mass were due to reduced adiposity. Therefore, we aimed to determine whether there were any differences in body composition. Body composition was measured using bioelectrical impedance spectroscopy at six weeks, six months, one year, and two years among offspring born to mothers who received a nutritional intervention (n = 268) or control (n = 264) supplement preconception and during pregnancy. There were no group-level differences in body composition, except at two years, when fat-free mass was greater among control offspring [adjusted mean difference (aMD) 0.14 kg, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.03, 0.25, P = 0.012]. However, there were no differences in mean percentage fat mass (%FM) at any time. In both groups, rapid weight gain [Δ weight > 0.67 standard deviation (SD) from birth to one year] was associated with greater %FM (aMD 2.0% at six months, 2.0% at one year, 1.4% at two years) compared with those who did not have rapid weight gain. Likewise, high BMI (≥ 95 percentile) at two years was associated with greater %FM (aMD 2.5%). A maternal nutritional intervention did not lead to differences in average offspring body composition in the first two years of life. However, fewer offspring from the supplemented group experienced rapid weight gain and high BMI, characterized by greater %FM.",,,w.cutfield@auckland.ac.nz.
40366078,Attitudes Towards the Use of Artificial Intelligence in Dermatology: A Survey of Australian Dermatologists.,,The Australasian journal of dermatology,10.1111/ajd.14524,"This study explored the views of dermatologists in Australia on the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in dermatology. Fellows and Trainees of the Australasian College of Dermatologists (ACD) were invited to participate in an anonymous online survey, resulting in a sample of 122 completed surveys (response rate 16.2%). Although 44% have used AI in their dermatology practice, only a minority are using AI regularly for clinical (12%) or administrative purposes (17%). A key barrier is trust, with most (69%) participants either unwilling or unsure about trusting AI for supporting the diagnosis of skin cancer. Participants identified accuracy and information on datasets, limitations, benefits, and the purpose of AI as important for trust. 52% want AI accuracy to be equivalent to or superior to the best dermatologist if it is used for clinical diagnosis. Participants perceived a range of benefits and risks of AI, with key risks around accuracy and divestment of AI to tech companies, and key benefits being reduction of monotonous tasks and improved patient access. Few (10%) are concerned about AI replacing dermatologists even though almost half (47%) expect key aspects of dermatology work will be performed by AI. Dermatologists in Australia are at an early stage of integrating AI into practice, with most wary or unsure about the accuracy of currently available AI tools for diagnostic purposes.

We aimed to assess the extent to which PrEP persistence varied by race/ethnicity, sex and age. Previously reported methods and US commercial pharmacy data identified PrEP users and days covered. We calculated PrEP Days Covered (PDC) as the annual number of pills dispensed (i.e., pill-days) overall and by sex, race/ethnicity and age group. Statistical differences by demographic characteristics were calculated. To assess the potential impact of 2-1-1 PrEP dosing on median days of PrEP use, we compared 2018 and 2022 (pre- and post-US Public Health Service guideline for 2-1-1 dosing). There were 225,180 PrEP users in 2018, and 459,984 in 2022. In 2022, the median PDC was 167 (IQR: 67, 308). There were 90 versus 180 median PDC for female and male users, respectively (difference of 90 PDC, 95% CI, 89.6-90.4). Among PrEP users with race/ethnicity data, the median PDC was higher for White non-Hispanic (NH) (290 days) than Hispanic (268 days) or Black NH (251 days) users. Older users had significantly more PDC than younger users (<16 years: 60 days; 16-29 years: 120 days; 30-64 years: 191 days). Residents of states with PrEP-Drug Assistance Programs (PrEP-DAP) or Medicaid expansion had higher median PrEP duration than states without programmes. Median days covered for 2018 (154 days) and 2022 (167 days) did not suggest that the addition of the 2-1-1 PrEP guideline was associated with fewer covered days. PrEP programmes are often evaluated by enumerating people who used PrEP at any time during a year; our data indicate that significant differences in days of PrEP covered among users might mask further inequities in PrEP protection among women, and Black, Hispanic and younger people. Evaluations of PrEP equity should include a pharmacoequity component by assessing days covered as an additional indicator of PrEP equity.",Russell ES; Woodyatt CR,Merck & Co.; OHSU Department of Emergency Medicine,

While the visual interpretation of CTG traces is highly subjective, with the inter-observer agreement as low as 29% and a false positive rate of approximately 60%, the Dawes-Redman system provides an automated approach to fetal well-being assessments. However, it is primarily designed to rule out adverse outcomes rather than detect them, resulting in a high specificity (90.7%) but low sensitivity (18.2%) in identifying fetal distress. This paper introduces PatchCTG, an AI-enabled biomedical time series transformer for CTG analysis. It employs patch-based tokenisation, instance normalisation, and channel-independent processing to capture essential local and global temporal dependencies within CTG signals. PatchCTG was evaluated on the Oxford Maternity (OXMAT) dataset, which comprises over 20,000 high-quality CTG traces from diverse clinical outcomes, after applying the inclusion and exclusion criteria. With extensive hyperparameter optimisation, PatchCTG achieved an AUC of 0.77, with a specificity of 88% and sensitivity of 57% at Youden's index threshold, demonstrating its adaptability to various clinical needs. Its robust performance across varying temporal thresholds highlights its potential for both real-time and retrospective analysis in sensor-driven fetal monitoring. Testing across varying temporal thresholds showcased it robust predictive performance, particularly with finetuning on data closer to delivery, achieving a sensitivity of 52% and specificity of 88% for near-delivery cases. These findings suggest the potential of PatchCTG to enhance clinical decision-making in antepartum care by providing a sensor-based, AI-driven, objective tool for reliable fetal health assessment.",,,

Apart from its molecular biology, BDNF is a powerful target for transformative benefit in precision medicine, leading to innovative therapeutic approaches for neurodegenerative and psychiatric diseases like Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), major depressive disorder (MDD), and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Nevertheless, clinical applicability is obstructed by hurdles in delivery, patient-specific diversity, and pleiotropic signaling. Here, we summarize findings in BDNF research, including its regulatory pathways and diagnostic/prognostic biomarkers and integrative therapeutic approaches. We describe innovative delivery systems, such as lipid nanoparticle-based mRNA therapies and CRISPR-dCas9-based epigenetic editing that bypass obstacles such as BBB (blood-brain barrier) and enzymatic degradation. The recent implementation of multiplex panels combining BDNF biodynamic indicators with tau and amyloid-β signaling markers showcases novel levels of specificity for both early detection and potential therapeutic monitoring. Humanized preclinical models like iPSC-derived neurons and organoids point to the key role of BDNF in neurodeveloping and neurodegenerative processes, paralleling advances in bridging preclinical observation and clinical environments. Moreover, novel therapeutic tools delivering TrkB activators or the implementation of AI-based dynamic care platforms enable tailored and scalable treatments.

Considering that this group constitutes a substantial portion of the country's productive workforce, their health requires continuous management to ensure sustained productivity. The purpose of this study is to investigate the factors associated with UMN in economically active middle-aged adults and to develop a model to predict the occurrence of UMN. In this study, 3,575 middle-aged adults who are economically active were selected from the 2020 Korean Health Panel Survey data. Logistic regression, Random Forest, Naïve Bayes, Gradient Boosting Method, and Neural Network were applied to create the prediction model, and tenfold cross validation was performed by checking the reliability of the analysis. The model was evaluated based on the Area Under Receiver Operating Characteristics (AUROC) as well as accuracy, precision, recall, F-1 score and MCC. First, the prevalence of UMN in middle-aged adults was 15.6%. Second, random forest was found to be the model with the highest predictive power. It showed an AUROC of 0.831, Accuracy of 0.862, and F-1 score of 0.820. Third, the main factors influencing the occurrence of UMN were subjective stress and subjective health awareness. These findings suggest that psychological support is necessary in order to manage the occurrence of UMN among middle-aged adults, with regular stress management being especially important. However, the lower AUROC suggests that additional variables are needed to enhance the prediction model.",,,perves@gtec.ac.kr.

These barriers hinder academic performance, comprehension, and communication with patients, ultimately impacting the quality of healthcare delivery. Despite the prevalence of this issue, a comprehensive understanding of its effects remains underexplored. This systematic review aims to synthesize evidence on language barriers in medical education and propose strategies to address them. Following PRISMA guidelines, we conducted a systematic review of studies published up to March 21, 2024, using PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science. Eligible studies focused on language barriers faced by medical, pharmacy, nursing, dental, or veterinary students in countries relying on foreign-language-based medical education. Data extraction included study characteristics, reported language barriers, and their impact on education and patient communication. Quality assessment was performed using the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool. From 5,410 citations, 49 studies involving over 14,500 students met the inclusion criteria. Most studies (n = 32) were conducted in Arab countries, with 15 in Saudi Arabia. Two key themes emerged: (1) Education and Academic Performance: Students frequently reported difficulties comprehending foreign-language textbooks, lectures, and assessments, leading to poor academic outcomes, increased stress, and higher dropout rates. (2) Communication Skills with Patients: Studying and training in a foreign language hindered students' ability to communicate effectively with patients in their native language, impacting empathy, medical history collection, and overall patient care.

This single-center retrospective observational study included adults with brain MRIs for suspected stroke between January 2020 and April 2022. Diagnostic uncertain AIL were identified through reader disagreement or low certainty grading by a radiology resident, a neuroradiologist, and the original radiology report consisting of various neuroradiologists. A commercially available deep learning tool analyzing brain MRIs for AIL was evaluated to assess the impact of excluding uncertain cases on diagnostic odds ratios. Patient-related, MRI acquisition-related, and lesion-related factors were analyzed using the Wilcoxon rank sum test, χ2 test, and multiple logistic regression. The study was approved by the National Committee on Health Research Ethics. In 989 patients (median age 73 (IQR: 59-80), 53% female), certain AIL were found in 374 (38%), uncertain AIL in 63 (6%), and no AIL in 552 (56%). Excluding uncertain cases led to a four-fold increase in the diagnostic odds ratio (from 68 to 278), while a simulated case-control design resulted in a six-fold increase compared to the full disease spectrum (from 68 to 431). Independent factors associated with uncertain AIL were MRI artifacts, smaller lesion size, older lesion age, and infratentorial location. Excluding uncertain cases leads to a four-fold overestimation of the diagnostic odds ratio. MRI artifacts, smaller lesion size, infratentorial location, and older lesion age are associated with uncertain AIL and should be accounted for in validation studies.",,,christian.hedeager.krag.01@regionh.dk.
40359506,Effectiveness of eHealth for Medication Adherence in Renal Transplant Recipients: Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,2025-05-14,Journal of medical Internet research,10.2196/73520,"As the optimal treatment for end-stage renal disease, kidney transplantation has proven instrumental in enhancing patient survival and quality of life. Suboptimal medication adherence is recognized as an independent risk factor for poor prognosis, graft rejection, and graft loss. In recent years, the advancement of IT has facilitated the integration of eHealth technologies into medical medication management, offering potential solutions to improve patient adherence. However, their efficacy in kidney transplant recipients remains inconclusive. This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of eHealth interventions in improving medication adherence among kidney transplant recipients and identify potential influencing factors. We systematically searched PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, Embase, CINAHL, Scopus, and Ovid databases for randomized controlled trials evaluating eHealth interventions targeting immunosuppressant medication adherence in kidney transplant recipients. The search time frame spanned from database inception to November 2024. Two investigators independently screened studies, extracted data, and assessed outcomes. Primary outcomes included adherence measured by self-reported questionnaires, electronic monitoring devices, tacrolimus trough levels, intrapatient variability of tacrolimus concentrations, and the proportion of patients achieving a tacrolimus coefficient of variation <40%. Meta-analyses were performed for dichotomous data and continuous data, while narrative synthesis was applied to single studies or data unsuitable for meta-analysis. Subgroup analyses were conducted to determine whether results differed based on adherence assessment methods, follow-up duration, eHealth functionalities, delivery modes, and intervention designs. Risk of bias and evidence quality were evaluated using the Cochrane Risk of Bias 2 tool and the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation approach, respectively. A total of 12 studies involving 1234 kidney transplant recipients were included. Significant between-group differences in adherence were observed only when assessed via electronic monitoring devices (risk ratio=1.46, P=.006; mean difference=0.37, P<.001). However, sensitivity analyses using the leave-one-out method demonstrated instability in these findings. Conflicting results or nonsignificant differences (P>.05) were identified across other outcome measures and subgroup analyses. No definitive conclusions can be drawn regarding the efficacy of eHealth interventions in improving medication adherence among kidney transplant recipients, potentially due to heterogeneity in trial designs, intervention characteristics, user preferences, and variations in adherence definitions and measurement methodologies. These uncertainties are underscored by the low or very low quality of evidence, as assessed using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation approach. While eHealth holds promise, methodological refinements in study design and implementation remain critical. Future research should prioritize high-quality, large-scale evidence to validate its clinical efficacy. PROSPERO CRD42025640638; https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/PROSPERO/view/CRD42025640638.",,,

This was a single-center, cross-sectional study. Patients with non-advanced AMD exhibiting signs of RPD on multimodal imaging were enrolled. Two independent masked graders manually delineated the margins of the area occupied by RPD using the three distinct imaging techniques. The study included 60 eyes from 51 patients, with a mean age of 81.5 (±7.1) years.The intraclass correlation coefficient between the two graders across all imaging modalities was 0.96 for FAF, 0.92 for NIR, and 0.98 for OCT+NIR. The narrowest limits of agreement were observed with OCT+NIR (-4.38 +5.17 mm2). Foveal involvement and age were significantly correlated with larger RPD area (p=0.036 and p=0.019 respectively). Pairwise comparisons of square root-transformed RPD areas indicated that FAF detected a significantly larger RPD area compared to other methods (p<0.001). These findings validate OCT+NIR as a reliable approach for measuring RPD areas, potentially serving as a critical biomarker for AMD in future clinical trials.",,,

We performed a multicenter longitudinal cohort study of HCFA NTM epidemiology. We retrospectively analyzed positive cultures for NTM performed from 2012 through 2020 within a network of 10 US academic hospitals and associated clinics. A unique NTM episode was defined as a patient's first positive culture for a particular NTM species and specimen source category (pulmonary vs extrapulmonary). Episodes linked to specimens obtained on day 3 or later of hospitalization were classified as hospital-onset (HO). Seven hospitals contributed at least 12 months of data prior to January 2014. Within this closed cohort, incidence rate ratios (IRRs) and trends in incidence from 2014 through 2020 were estimated, assuming the number of episodes followed the Poisson distribution. A total of 12 855 unique NTM episodes occurred from 2012 through 2020 during 19 248 137 patient-days of surveillance. Of these episodes, 3045 (24%) were HO. HO incidence rates were highly variable among hospitals, with a median hospital rate of 1.06 episodes per 10 000 patient-days (range, 0.35-5.48).

40357564,A systematic methodological evaluation of sepsis guidelines: Protocol for quality assessment and consistency of recommendations.,2025-05-13,Acta anaesthesiologica Scandinavica,10.1111/aas.70036,"Sepsis is a leading cause of mortality worldwide, characterized by a dysregulated host response to infection. Despite the development of multiple clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) to standardize sepsis management, substantial variability exists in methodological quality and key clinical recommendations. This inconsistency complicates guideline implementation and potentially affects patient outcomes. The proposed systematic methodological review aims to evaluate the quality and consistency of sepsis guidelines to identify areas for improvement and provide actionable insights for guideline developers. This protocol outlines a systematic methodological review of sepsis CPGs published over the last two decades (2004-2025). A comprehensive search strategy will be conducted across PubMed, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library, and the official websites of professional societies to identify relevant guidelines. The inclusion criteria are CPGs targeting adult sepsis management published by recognized medical or governmental organizations with detailed methodological descriptions. We will use the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation II instrument to assess methodological quality across six domains: scope and purpose, stakeholder involvement, rigor of development, clarity of presentation, applicability, and editorial independence. Data extraction will focus on key clinical recommendations, including fluid resuscitation, antimicrobial therapy, vasopressor and inotrope use, corticosteroids, source control, blood glucose management, hemodynamic management, and mechanical ventilation management. The consistency of the recommendations will be analyzed, and trends in guideline quality over time will be evaluated. Artificial intelligence (AI) tools will be evaluated for data extraction processes in systematic reviews to determine their capacity for efficiency and accuracy in extracting data compared to human-driven methods. By systematically appraising the quality and consistency of sepsis guidelines, this review aims to address the existing gaps and discrepancies in guideline development and application. These findings will provide valuable insights into the evolution of sepsis guideline quality, highlight areas for improvement, and support the development of more robust evidence-based recommendations. These results will inform clinicians and guideline developers, ultimately enhancing the standardization and effectiveness of sepsis management worldwide.

40356852,A hybrid approach to predicting and classifying dental impaction: integrating regularized regression and XG boost methods.,,Frontiers in oral health,10.3389/froh.2025.1524206,"Dental impaction is a significant clinical challenge that requires advanced predictive modeling and healthcare analytics approaches. Impaction, a tooth alignment issue, is diagnosed using radiographic measurements like panoramic radiographs and CBCT. Artificial Intelligence (AI) is improving the accuracy of predicting dental impaction. Advanced predictive models like logistic Regression and XGBoost analyze critical variables, identify patterns, and perform predictive analysis. These models can identify potential impactions, assess impaction type, and develop treatment plans. Integrating AI into radiographic assessments is expected to enhance further the precision and risk-minimizing capabilities of surgical planning in dentistry. This study presents a hybrid approach combining regularized regression and ensemble methods to enhance the classification and prediction of dental impaction outcomes. By leveraging machine learning and statistical learning techniques, we aim to develop a robust clinical decision support system for dental practitioners. This research aims to predict the eruption of 3rd molars in the mandible by analyzing three parameters: the distance from the lower 2nd molar to the anterior border, the mesiodistal width of the third molar, and the distance from the apex of the root to the inferior border of the mandible. The study is quantitative, observational, and cross-sectional retrospective. The distance from the lower 2nd molar to the anterior border determines the importance of space available for eruption. The distance from the root apex to the lower border addresses natural eruptive forces and resistance during the eruption. The study aims to find a correlation between eruption and distance from the root apex to the lower border of the mandible. Our feature selection process utilizes ensemble learning algorithms integrated with regularized regression techniques to analyze various parameters. This data analysis framework combines multiple predictive modeling approaches to achieve optimal results. The horizontal type of impaction has the lowest S/W ratio (0.9267), indicating the least available distal to 2nd molar space. This suggests a low potential for future eruptions. The regression equation calculates the S/W ratio using impacted molar width and distal space. A ratio greater than 1.1 indicates a good probability of lower 3rd molar eruption, while a below 0.8 indicates no eruption. The algorithm development process demonstrated the effectiveness of our hybrid approach in dental health analytics. The study improved impaction prediction accuracy to a rate of 78%, with horizontal class predictions achieving a precision of 0.72 and an error rate of 28.1%. Additionally, the regularized logistic regression model attained 75% accuracy for classification and prediction. The study aims to improve dental research by predicting the eruption behavior of lower molars, enabling dental practitioners to make more concise treatment plans. The study identifies the most significant parameters for establishing the space/width ratio: Distance from the second molar to the anterior ramus border and the third molar's mesiodistal width. Enhancing data quality, refining feature selection, and using advanced modeling techniques are crucial for improving predictive capabilities. The findings can help practitioners optimize treatments and reduce potential complications.",,,

However, CCE's low completion rate and inability to take biopsies or remove polyps often result in a CCE-to-conventional colonoscopy conversion (CCC). The aim is to identify the factors that predict issues with bowel cleansing, capsule excretion rates, pathology detection, and the need for CCC. This prospective study analysed data from patients who underwent CCE as part of the CESCAIL study from Nov 2021 till June 2024. Predictive factors were examined for their association with CCC, including patient demographics, comorbidities, medications, and laboratory results from symptomatic and surveillance groups. Statistical methods such as LASSO, linear, and logistic regression were applied. Six hundred and three participants were analysed. Elevated f-Hb levels (OR = 1.48, 95% CI:1.18-1.86, p = 0.0002) and smoking (OR = 1.44, 95% CI: 1.01-2.11, p = 0.047) were significantly associated with CCC. The area under the curve (AUC) of elevated f-Hb for predicting CCC was 0.62 after adjusting for confounders. Diabetes was linked to poor bowel preparation (OR = 0.40, 95%CI:0.18-0.87, p = 0.022). Alcohol (p = 0.004), smoking (p = 0.003), psychological conditions (p = 0.001), and haemoglobin levels (p = 0.046) were significantly associated with the number of polyps, whilst antidepressants (p = 0.003) and beta-blockers (p = 0.001) were linked to the size of polyps. Non-smokers with lower f-Hb levels are less likely to need conventional colonoscopy (CCC). Patient selection criteria are key to minimising the colonoscopy conversion rate.

AI-driven screening using chest radiographs could improve early detection, reduce fracture risk, and improve public health outcomes. To assess the cost-effectiveness of deep learning models (hereafter referred to as AI-driven) applied to chest radiographs for opportunistic osteoporosis screening in German women aged 50 and older. A decision tree and microsimulation Markov model were used to calculate the cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained (€2024) for screening with AI-driven chest radiographs followed by treatment, compared to no screening and treatment. Patient pathways were based on AI model accuracy and German osteoporosis guidelines. Women with a fracture risk below 5% received no treatment, those with 5-10% risk received alendronate, and women 65 + with a risk above 10% received sequential treatment starting with romosozumab. Data was validated by a German clinical expert, incorporating real-world treatment persistence, DXA follow-up rates, and treatment initiation. Sensitivity analyses assessed parameter uncertainty. The cost per QALY gained from screening was €13,340, far below the typical cost-effectiveness threshold of €60,000. Optimizing follow-up, treatment initiation, and medication adherence further improved cost-effectiveness, with dominance achievable by halving medication non-persistence, and in women aged 50-64. AI-driven chest radiographs for opportunistic osteoporosis screening is a cost-effective strategy for German women aged 50+, with the potential to significantly improve public health outcomes, reduce fracture burdens and address healthcare disparities.

However, most existing works choose their datasets and modeling approaches empirically and in an ad hoc manner. A prior study proposed four partial information decomposition (PID)-based metrics to provide a theoretical understanding of multimodal data interactions: redundancy, uniqueness of each modality, and synergy. However, these metrics have only been evaluated in a limited collection of biomedical data, and the existing work does not elucidate the effect of parameter selection when calculating the PID metrics. In this work, we evaluate PID metrics on a wider range of biomedical data, including clinical, radiology, pathology, and genomic data, and propose potential improvements to the PID metrics. We apply the PID metrics to seven different modality pairs across four distinct cohorts (datasets). We compare and interpret trends in the resulting PID metrics and downstream model performance in these multimodal cohorts. The downstream tasks being evaluated include predicting the prognosis (either overall survival or recurrence) of patients with non-small cell lung cancer, prostate cancer, and glioblastoma. We found that, while PID metrics are informative, solely relying on these metrics to decide on a fusion approach does not always yield a machine learning model with optimal performance. Of the seven different modality pairs, three had poor (0%), three had moderate (66%-89%), and only one had perfect (100%) consistency between the PID values and model performance. We propose two improvements to the PID metrics (determining the optimal parameters and uncertainty estimation) and identified areas where PID metrics could be further improved. The current PID metrics are not accurate enough for estimating the multimodal data interactions and need to be improved before they can serve as a reliable tool.

Understanding these attitudes is important to inform the best approaches to exploring their use in medicine. Our aim was to evaluate the health care professionals' awareness and perceptions regarding potential applications of ChatGPT in the medical field, including potential benefits and challenges of adoption. We designed a 33-question online survey that was distributed among health care professionals via targeted emails and professional Twitter and LinkedIn accounts. The survey included a range of questions to define respondents' demographic characteristics, familiarity with ChatGPT, perceptions of this tool's usefulness and reliability, and opinions on its potential to improve patient care, research, and education efforts. One hundred and fifteen health care professionals from 21 countries responded to the survey, including physicians, nurses, researchers, and educators.

40354542,A prolactin-targeting antibody to prevent stress-induced peripheral nociceptor sensitization and female postoperative pain.,2025-05-13,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,10.1073/pnas.2501229122,"Scheduled surgeries elicit stress in many patients. Levels of preoperative stress, anxiety, and female gender are known risk factors for increased and prolonged postoperative pain. The mechanisms by which psychological stress increases postoperative pain, especially in women, remain unknown. We hypothesized that stress amplifies postoperative pain by sensitizing dorsal root ganglion (DRG) nociceptors. Prolactin (PRL) is a female-predominant neurohormone that is controlled by estrogen and stress. PRL signals at the prolactin receptor long (PRLR-L) and short (PRLR-S) isoforms to induce gene transcription and nociception, respectively. Critically, prolactin sensitizes female, but not male, murine, Macaque and human nociceptors, revealing an evolutionarily conserved mechanism with high translational potential for human therapy. Prior restraint stress (RS) increased the magnitude and duration of incisional injury-induced postoperative pain hypersensitivity in both male and female mice. In females, RS or incisional injury downregulated PRLR-L and increased PRL-dependent nociceptor excitability. Female selective inhibition of postoperative pain hypersensitivity was produced by a) pharmacological inhibition of pituitary PRL b) overexpression of DRG PRLR-L to bias PRL signaling away from PRLR-S and c) CRISPR/Cas9 editing of PRLR isoforms. PL200,019, our recently discovered monoclonal antibody against human PRL (hPRL), prevented hPRL-induced sensitization of human female nociceptors. Using female mice genetically modified to express hPRL, rather than murine PRL, PL200,019 prevented both stress and incisional injury-induced hypersensitivity. Preemptive inhibition of stress-induced nociceptor sensitization with a monoclonal antibody to sequester PRL can improve female postoperative pain, diminish the need for postoperative opioids and decrease the risks of transition to chronic pain.",Ghetti A; Maciuba S; Bowden G; Rivière P,Peptide Logic; Anabios Corporation,
40354107,Clinical Value of ChatGPT for Epilepsy Presurgical Decision-Making: Systematic Evaluation of Seizure Semiology Interpretation.,2025-05-12,Journal of medical Internet research,10.2196/69173,"For patients with drug-resistant focal epilepsy, surgical resection of the epileptogenic zone (EZ) is an effective treatment to control seizures. Accurate localization of the EZ is crucial and is typically achieved through comprehensive presurgical approaches such as seizure semiology interpretation, electroencephalography (EEG), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and intracranial EEG (iEEG). However, interpreting seizure semiology is challenging because it heavily relies on expert knowledge. The semiologies are often inconsistent and incoherent, leading to variability and potential limitations in presurgical evaluation. To overcome these challenges, advanced technologies like large language models (LLMs)-with ChatGPT being a notable example-offer valuable tools for analyzing complex textual information, making them well-suited to interpret detailed seizure semiology descriptions and accurately localize the EZ. This study evaluates the clinical value of ChatGPT for interpreting seizure semiology to localize EZs in presurgical assessments for patients with focal epilepsy and compares its performance with that of epileptologists. We compiled 2 data cohorts: a publicly sourced cohort of 852 semiology-EZ pairs from 193 peer-reviewed journal publications and a private cohort of 184 semiology-EZ pairs collected from Far Eastern Memorial Hospital (FEMH) in Taiwan. ChatGPT was evaluated to predict the most likely EZ locations using 2 prompt methods: zero-shot prompting (ZSP) and few-shot prompting (FSP). To compare the performance of ChatGPT, 8 epileptologists were recruited to participate in an online survey to interpret 100 randomly selected semiology records. The responses from ChatGPT and epileptologists were compared using 3 metrics: regional sensitivity (RSens), weighted sensitivity (WSens), and net positive inference rate (NPIR). In the publicly sourced cohort, ChatGPT demonstrated high RSens reliability, achieving 80% to 90% for the frontal and temporal lobes; 20% to 40% for the parietal lobe, occipital lobe, and insular cortex; and only 3% for the cingulate cortex. The WSens, which accounts for biased data distribution, consistently exceeded 67%, while the mean NPIR remained around 0. These evaluation results based on the private FEMH cohort are consistent with those from the publicly sourced cohort. A group t test with 1000 bootstrap samples revealed that ChatGPT-4 significantly outperformed epileptologists in RSens for the most frequently implicated EZs, such as the frontal and temporal lobes (P<.001).

Analyzing 45 defecation events from 11 participants, key defecation parameters are identified, including stool dropping duration, stool thickness, and eu-tenesmus interval. Stool dropping duration follows a log-normal distribution, with longer durations (>5 s) linked to lower Bristol Stool Form Scale (BSFS) scores, suggesting constipation (p = 0.008 for BSFS1/2/3 vs BSFS5/6/7). Stool thickness decreases with increasing BSFS scores (p = 5 × 10⁻⁶ for BSFS1/2/3 vs BSFS5/6/7), validating its role as an objective marker for bowel function. Eu-tenesmus is introduced, defined as the interval between the last stool drop and cleansing, averaging 74.8 s. It shows significant gender differences (p = 0.014) but no correlation with stool consistency, suggesting its potential as an independent biomarker for gut health. Defecation behaviors between humans and animals is also compared in detail. Longitudinal monitoring demonstrates the potential for personalized health tracking and dietary recommendations. Furthermore, the feasibility of biometric identification is established using 11 defecation-related parameters, including stool properties and cleansing behavior. These features enable high participant differentiation, supporting non-invasive identity verification.",,,

Large Language Models (LLMs) can be a powerful tool to expedite SRs. We conducted a comparative study to evaluate the performance of a commercial tool, Rayyan, and an in-house LLM-based system in automating the screening of a completed SR on Vitamin D and falls. The SR retrieved 14,439 articles, and Rayyan was trained with 2,000 manually screened articles to categorize the rest as most likely to exclude/include, likely to exclude/include and undecided. We analyzed Rayyan's title/abstract screening performance using different inclusion thresholds. For the LLM, we used prompt engineering for title/abstract screening and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for full-text screening. We evaluated performance using article exclusion rate (AER), false negative rate (FNR), specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV). Additionally, we compared the time required to complete screening steps of the SR using both approaches against the manual screening method. Using Rayyan, including considered as undecided or likely to include for title/abstract screening resulted in an AER of 72.1% and an FNR of 5%. The total estimated screening time, including manual review of articles flagged by Rayyan, was 54.7 hours. Lowering the Rayyan threshold to 'likely to exclude' reduced the FNR to 0% and the AER to 50.7%, but increased the screening time to 81.3 h. Using the LLM system, after title/abstract and full-text screening, 78 articles remained for manual review, including all 20 identified by traditional methods. The LLM achieved an AER of 99.5%, specificity of 99.6%, PPV of 25.6%, and NPV of 100%, with a total screening time of 25.5 h, including manual review of the 78 articles, reducing the manual screening time by 95.5%. The LLM-based system significantly enhances SR efficiency, compared to manual methods and Rayyan while maintaining low FNR.",,,fat10@mail.aub.edu.

This study examines the relationship between NLRP3 inflammasome activation and mitophagy in the temporal lobe epilepsy, which has not been reported before. A pilocarpine-induced epileptic rat model was used to assess seizure activity and neuronal loss. Pyroptosis markers (NLRP3, cleaved Gasdermin D, IL-1β/IL-18), and autophagy/mitophagy activity (LC3B-II/I, BNIP3, TOMM20/LC3B colocalization) were analyzed via immunofluorescence, Western blot, and transmission electron microscopy. NLRP3 inhibitors and anti-IL-1β antibodies were administered to evaluate therapeutic effects. Epileptic rats exhibited progressive neuronal loss and seizure aggravation, correlating with NLRP3 inflammasome activation and pyroptosis. While general autophagy was upregulated, mitophagy was selectively impaired in the hippocampus. NLRP3 activation promoted IL-1β release, which suppressed mitophagy via PPTC7 upregulation. NLRP3 activation inhibitor (MCC950) and anti-IL-1β treatment restored mitophagy and reduced seizures. NLRP3 inflammasome-driven pyroptosis exacerbates epilepsy by impairing mitophagy activity via IL-1β/PPTC7. Targeted NLRP3 inhibition mitigates this cascade, offering a promising strategy for refractory epilepsy.",,,chenxiaoqian-sl@qq.com.

This systematic review focuses on the intersection of AI-based digital twins and their applications in prostate cancer pathology. A digital twin, when applied to healthcare, creates a dynamic, data-driven virtual model that simulates a patient's biological systems in real-time. By incorporating AI techniques such as Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL), these systems enhance predictive accuracy, enable early diagnosis, and facilitate individualized treatment strategies for prostate cancer. This review systematically examines recent advances (2020-2025) in AI-driven digital twins for prostate cancer, highlighting key methodologies, algorithms, and data integration strategies. The literature analysis also reveals substantial progress in image processing, predictive modeling, and clinical decision support systems, which are the basic tools used when implementing digital twins for prostate cancer care. Our survey also critically evaluates the strengths and limitations of current approaches, identifying gaps such as the need for real-time data integration, improved explainability in AI models, and more robust clinical validation. It concludes with a discussion of future research directions, emphasizing the importance of integrating multi-modal data with Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Models (VLMs), scalability, and ethical considerations in advancing AI-driven digital twins for prostate cancer diagnosis and treatment.

40347428,"Performance of EMA algorithm, 2022 ACR/EULAR criteria, and EMA-ACR/EULAR algorithm in classifying pediatric ANCA-associated vasculitis: a national cohort study in China.",,World journal of pediatrics : WJP,10.1007/s12519-025-00899-2,"Anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-associated vasculitis (AAV) is a type of necrotizing vasculitis with poor prognosis, which is more severe in children. Classifying AAV patients may be helpful for diagnosis and management. However, present classification criteria for pediatric AAV are developed mainly based on adults, which have limitations in clinical practice. In this study, we introduced an updated algorithm based on the European Medicines Agency (EMA) algorithm in conjunction with the American College of Rheumatology (ACR)/European Alliance of Associations for Rheumatology (EULAR) criteria. This new approach aims to resolve the issue of duplicate classification present in the 2022 ACR/EULAR criteria and to refine the existing EMA algorithm. This study included 179 pediatric patients diagnosed with AAV across 17 centers in China. Patients were classified using the EMA algorithm, the ACR/EULAR criteria, and the EMA-ACR/EULAR algorithm. The Kappa value and Net Reclassification Index (NRI) were used to evaluate the classification performance of these criteria. According to the EMA algorithm, 136 (76.0%) patients were classified with microscopic polyangiitis (MPA) and 14 (7.8%) with granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA), while 29 (16.2%) remained unclassifiable. According to the ACR/EULAR criteria, 145 (81.0%) patients were classified with MPA, 14 (7.8%) with GPA, 2 (1.1%) with eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA), and 4 (2.2%) with both MPA and GPA, while 14 (7.8%) remained unclassifiable. The EMA-ACR/EULAR algorithm classified 124 patients (69.3%) as MPA, 26 (14.5%) as GPA, and 2 (1.1%) as EGPA, while 27 (15.1%) were unclassified. The Kappa values between the EMA algorithm and ACR/EULAR criteria for GPA and MPA were 0.225 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.000-0.456, P = 0.003] and 0.357 (95% CI 0.196-0.518, P < 0.001). Compared to these two criteria, the EMA-ACR/EULAR algorithm demonstrated positive NRIs in the classification of both GPA (0.702, 95% CI 0.258-1.146, P = 0.002; 0.547 95% CI 0.150-0.944, P = 0.007) and MPA (0.425, 95% CI 0.209-0.642, P < 0.001; 0.519, 95% CI 0.305-0.733, P < 0.001). The EMA-ACR/EULAR algorithm addresses the limitations of the 1990 ACR criteria within the EMA framework and resolves the issue of duplicate classification in the 2022 ACR/EULAR criteria. However, further research is necessary to validate the superiority of the EMA-ACR/EULAR algorithm in the clinical classification of pediatric AAV patients.",,,zhaihua@njmu.edu.cn.

Artificial intelligence (AI) may both offer benefits and create risks for breast screening programmes. To use AI in health screening services, the views and expectations of consumers are critical. This study examined the preferences of Australian women regarding AI use in breast cancer screening and the impact of information on preferences using discrete choice experiments. The experiment presented two alternative screening services based on seven attributes (reading method, screening sensitivity, screening specificity, time between screening and receiving results, supporting evidence, fair representation, and who should be held accountable) to 2063 women aged between 40 and 74 years recruited from an online panel. Participants were randomised into two arms. Both received standard information on AI use in breast screening, but one arm received additional information on its potential benefits. Preferences for hypothetical breast cancer screening services were modelled using a random parameter logit model. Relative attribute importance and uptake rates were estimated. Participants preferred mixed reading (radiologist + AI system) over the other two reading methods. They showed a strong preference for fewer missed cases with a high attribute relative importance. Fewer false positives and a shorter waiting time for results were also preferred. Strength of preferences for mixed reading was significantly higher compared to two radiologists when additional information on AI is provided, highlighting the impact of information. This study revealed the preferences among Australian women for the use of AI-driven breast cancer screening services. Results generally suggest women are open to their mammograms being read by both a radiologist and an AI-based system under certain conditions.",,,Maame.Woode@monash.edu.

A mixed-method cross-sectional analysis was conducted using validated PFA scenarios from the Institute for Disaster Mental Health. Five scenarios representing different disaster contexts were selected. Data were collected by prompting both chatbots to perform PFA based on these scenarios. Quantitative performance was assessed using the PFA principles of Look, Listen, and Link, with scores assigned using IFRC's PFA scoring template. Qualitative analysis involved content analysis for AI hallucination, coding responses, and thematic analysis to identify key subthemes and themes. ChatGPT-4 outperformed Gemini, achieving an overall score of 90% (CI: 86%-93%) compared to Gemini's 73% (CI: 67%-79%), a statistically significant difference (p = 0.01). In the Look domain, ChatGPT-4 scored higher (p = 0.02), while both performed equally in the Listen and Link domain. The content analysis of AI hallucinations reveals that ChatGPT-4 has a relative frequency of 18.4% (CI: 12%-25%), while Gemini exhibits a relative frequency of 50.0% (CI: 26.6%-71.3%), (p < 0.01). Five themes emerged from the qualitative analysis: Look, Listen, Link, Professionalism, Mental Health, and Psychosocial Support. ChatGPT-4 demonstrated superior performance in providing PFA compared to Gemini. While AI chatbots show potential as supportive tools for PFA providers, concerns regarding AI hallucinations highlight the need for cautious implementation. Further research is necessary to enhance the reliability and safety of AI-assisted PFA, particularly by eliminating hallucinations, and to integrate the current advances in voice-based chatbot functionality.",Gan RK; Gan AZ; Cernuda Martínez JA; González PA,Medicure KB Clinic; Unit for Research in Emergency and Disaster,

Despite the importance of digital health education, consensus on essential primary medical degree content is lacking. Focusing on core competence domains can address critical skills while minimising additions to an already demanding curriculum. This study identifies the minimum essential digital health competency domains from the perspectives of learners, teachers, and content experts aiming to provide a framework for integrating digital health education into medical curricula. We conducted focus groups with students (n = 17), and semi-structured interviews with medical educators (n = 12) and digital sector experts (n = 11) using video conferencing. Participants were recruited using purposive sampling. The data were analysed using framework analysis and inductive thematic analysis to identify common themes. Four core themes and eleven sub-themes were identified and aggregated into four essential competency domains: ""Understand the Local Digital Health Ecosystem and Landscape"", ""Safe, Secure and Ethical Information Literacy and Management"", ""Proficiency in Digital Health Tools and Associated Technologies"" and ""Scholarly Research and Evidence-based Practice"". Medical educator and digital sector expert participants provided the greatest source of data for curriculum content consideration. Students demonstrated varying levels of aptitude, confidence, and interest in technology. Our balanced engagement with learners, educators, and digital health experts enabled the identification of a context-relevant framework for the minimum essential digital health competence domains for graduating medical students. The identification of focused, clinically relevant core competencies makes them amenable to integration into an existing curriculum tailored to local contexts. This approach addresses limitations of restricted curricular space and accommodates varying student interests, confidence and aptitude in technology. The delivery approach should consider a student-centred adaptive modality that takes advantage of advances in artificial intelligence (AI) as an effective pedagogical tool.",,,Rebecca.Grainger@otago.ac.nz.

Nevertheless, their actual uptake is limited. Although endorsement by healthcare providers (HCPs) is one of the perceived facilitators for using this technology, the perceptions of key HCPs in skin cancer triage towards those apps have not been studied. To explore key HCPs' perceived risks, benefits, and preconditions for endorsement of mHealth apps for skin cancer triage in the general population. An in-depth qualitative online focus group (FG) study was conducted consisting of six focus groups: three with dermatologists and three with general practitioners (GPs). Dutch dermatologists and GPs were selected using purposive sampling based on age, knowledge and previous experience with AI. A total of sixteen dermatologists and seventeen GPs attended 90-minute FGs. Data were analyzed by a multidisciplinary team in a thorough thematic content analysis using multiple phases of coding derived from Grounded Theory. A total of four main risks, three main benefits, and four main preconditions for endorsement were identified. Risks perceived by HCPs concerned incorrect diagnoses, exclusion of subpopulations, and loss of GP autonomy in clinical decision making and diagnostic experience. Perceived benefits were increased skin cancer awareness, facilitation of the early detection of skin cancer, and a streamlined patient journey. Preconditions for endorsement were evidence-based verification of accuracy, integration in clinical practice, clarity about liability in case of adverse events, and accessible and inclusive app design. Although HCPs perceive pivotal risks related to the implementation of mHealth apps, they also foresee important benefits when implemented successfully. In order for HCPs to endorse those apps, emphasis must be placed on integrating accurate mHealth apps with accessible and inclusive design and functionality into clinical practice, factors that currently appear to be largely unmet.",,,m.lugtenberg@erasmusmc.nl.

In this study, we describe a single-step approach to deploy the Neuroform Atlas stent without the need for ELW or lesion re-access, using the MINI TREK II over-the-wire (OTW) semi-compliant coronary balloon. We performed a retrospective review of prospectively maintained mechanical thrombectomy databases from two comprehensive stroke centers. The study included consecutive large vessel occlusion (LVO) stroke patients who underwent single-step angioplasty with the MINI TREK II OTW balloon followed by deployment of the Neuroform Atlas intracranial stent, without the use of an ELW. A total of 12 patients met the inclusion criteria. Among them, the median age was 67 years (IQR: 58-73) and 50% were female. Most patients had middle cerebral artery (MCA) M1 occlusion (75%). One-third of the patients received intravenous thrombolysis. All patients achieved successful reperfusion (modified Treatment in Cerebral Ischemia (mTICI) 2b/3) with a median of two passes. The median National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score decreased from 14 (IQR: 10-19) at baseline to 4 (IQR: 1-9) at discharge, and the median modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score was 1 (IQR: 1-4) at discharge and 3 (IQR: 2-4) at 90 days. None of the patients in this series experienced symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage, though two patients (16.7%) were dead at 90 days but there was no procedural-related mortality. This preliminary experience demonstrates the technical feasibility and success of single-step deployment of the Neuroform Atlas stent following angioplasty with the MINI TREK II OTW balloon, without the need for an ELW or lesion re-access.

In recent years, an increasing number of DL-based systems have been approved by the relevant regulators, e.g. FDA. Although obtaining regulatory approvals is a prerequisite to deploy such systems for real world use, it may not be sufficient. Regulatory approvals give confidence in the development process for such systems, but new hazardous events can arise depending on how the systems have been deployed in the intended clinical pathways or how they have been used with other systems in complex healthcare settings. These kinds of events can be difficult to predict during the development process. Indeed, most health systems and hospitals require self-verification before deploying a diagnostic medical device, which could be viewed as an additional safety measure. This shows that it is important to carry on assuring the safety of such systems in deployment. In this work, we address this urgent need based on the experience of a prospective study in UK hospitals as part of the ARTICULATE PRO project. In particular, the system considered in this work is developed by Paige for prostate cancer diagnosis, which has obtained FDA approval in the US and UKCA marks in the UK. The methodology presented in this work starts by mapping out the clinical workflow within which the system has been deployed, then carries out hazard and risk analysis based on the clinical workflow, and finally presents a deployment safety case, which provides a basis for deployment and continual monitoring of the safety of this system in use.

African American (AA) men reportedly have a worse prognosis for prostate cancer (PCa) and are underrepresented in the development genomic biomarkers. We assess the generalizability of tools developed using a multimodal AI (MMAI) deep learning system using digital histopathology and clinical data from NRG/Radiation Therapy Oncology Group PCa trials across racial subgroups. In total, 5,708 patients from five randomized phase III trials were included. Two MMAI algorithms were evaluated: (1) the distant metastasis (DM) MMAI model optimized to predict risk of DM, and (2) the PCa-specific mortality (PCSM) MMAI model optimized to focus on prediction death in the presence of DM (DDM). The prognostic performance of the MMAI algorithms was evaluated in AA and non-AA subgroups using time to DM (primary end point) and time to DDM (secondary end point). Exploratory end points included time to biochemical failure and overall survival with Fine-Gray or Cox proportional hazards models.

40344203,Application of Artificial Intelligence in Cardio-Oncology Imaging for Cancer Therapy-Related Cardiovascular Toxicity: Systematic Review.,2025-05-10,JMIR cancer,10.2196/63964,"Artificial intelligence (AI) is a revolutionary tool yet to be fully integrated into several health care sectors, including medical imaging. AI can transform how medical imaging is conducted and interpreted, especially in cardio-oncology. This study aims to systematically review the available literature on the use of AI in cardio-oncology imaging to predict cardiotoxicity and describe the possible improvement of different imaging modalities that can be achieved if AI is successfully deployed to routine practice. We conducted a database search in PubMed, Ovid MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, CINAHL, and Google Scholar from inception to 2023 using the AI research assistant tool (Elicit) to search for original studies reporting AI outcomes in adult patients diagnosed with any cancer and undergoing cardiotoxicity assessment. Outcomes included incidence of cardiotoxicity, left ventricular ejection fraction, risk factors associated with cardiotoxicity, heart failure, myocardial dysfunction, signs of cancer therapy-related cardiovascular toxicity, echocardiography, and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging. Descriptive information about each study was recorded, including imaging technique, AI model, outcomes, and limitations. The systematic search resulted in 7 studies conducted between 2018 and 2023, which are included in this review. Most of these studies were conducted in the United States (71%), included patients with breast cancer (86%), and used magnetic resonance imaging as the imaging modality (57%). The quality assessment of the studies had an average of 86% compliance in all of the tool's sections. In conclusion, this systematic review demonstrates the potential of AI to enhance cardio-oncology imaging for predicting cardiotoxicity in patients with cancer. Our findings suggest that AI can enhance the accuracy and efficiency of cardiotoxicity assessments. However, further research through larger, multicenter trials is needed to validate these applications and refine AI technologies for routine use, paving the way for improved patient outcomes in cancer survivors at risk of cardiotoxicity.",Mushcab H; Eskandarani R; Sunbul T; AlOtaibi A,Health Informatics Department; Research Office; Emergency Department,

Its implementation in UK healthcare systems has been identified as a priority for deployment. Few studies have investigated the impact of the feedback from such systems on the end user. This study investigated the impact of two forms of AI feedback (saliency/heatmaps and AI diagnosis with percentage confidence) on student and qualified diagnostic radiographers' accuracy when determining binary diagnosis on skeletal radiographs. The AI feedback proved beneficial to accuracy in all cases except when the AI was incorrect and for pathological cases in the student group. The self-reported trust of all participants decreased from the beginning to the end of the study. The findings of this study should guide developers in the provision of the most advantageous forms of AI feedback and direct educators in tailoring education to highlight weaknesses in human interaction with AI-based clinical decision support systems.,,,

In medical applications, RAG has the potential to improve diagnostic accuracy, clinical decision support, and patient care. This narrative review explores the application of RAG across various medical domains, including guideline interpretation, diagnostic assistance, clinical trial eligibility screening, clinical information retrieval, and information extraction from scientific literature. Studies highlight the benefits of RAG in providing accurate, up-to-date information, improving clinical outcomes, and streamlining processes. Notable applications include GPT-4 models enhanced with RAG to interpret hepatologic guidelines, assist in differential diagnosis, and aid in clinical trial screening. Furthermore, RAG-based systems have demonstrated superior performance over traditional methods in tasks such as patient diagnosis, clinical decision-making, and medical information extraction. Despite its advantages, challenges remain, particularly in model evaluation, cost-efficiency, and reducing AI hallucinations.

However, without a sole identifying metric, LVDD is assessed by a diagnostic algorithm relying on secondary characteristics that is laborious and has potential for interobserver variability. To characterize concordance in clinical evaluations of LVDD, we evaluated historical echocardiogram studies at two academic medical centers for variability between clinician text reports and assessment by 2016 American Society of Echocardiography (ASE) guidelines. We then developed a workflow of 8 artificial intelligence (AI) models trained on over 155,000 studies to automate assessment of LVDD. Model performance was evaluated on temporally distinct held-out test sets from two academic medical centers. In a validation cohort of 955 studies from Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, our AI workflow demonstrated 76.5% agreement and a weighted Cohen's kappa of 0.52 with ASE guideline assessment using human measurements. In contrast, the clinician report evaluation had 48.5% agreement and a weighted Cohen's kappa of 0.29 with ASE guidelines. In the Stanford Healthcare cohort of 1,572 studies, the AI workflow had 66.7% agreement and a weighted Cohen's kappa of 0.27 with ASE guidelines, while the clinician assessment had 32.7% agreement and a weighted Cohen's kappa of 0.06. Performance was consistent across patient subgroups stratified by sex, age, hypertension, diabetes, obesity, and coronary artery disease. Clinicians are often inconsistent in evaluating LVDD.

Early examples of the design included the evaluation of seasonal influenza vaccine in the field. Recently, they have also been widely used to evaluate the efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines in preventing symptomatic disease for different variants (Evans and Jewell, 2021). The design hinges on individuals being tested for the disease of interest; upon recruitment, such individuals are subjected to a definitive test for the presence of the disease of interest (test-positives), or not (test-negatives) along with the determination of whether the individual has been exposed to the intervention under study (e.g. vaccination). In most early TND studies, individuals were tested because they were suffering from symptoms consistent with the disease in question, and the TND was a tool to reduce confounding due to healthcare-seeking behavior. However, in many cases such as COVID-19, and Ebola, testing results were available at healthcare facilities for individuals who presented for a variety of reasons in addition to symptoms (e.g. case contact tracing, etc.). Aggregating samples from symptomatic and asymptomatic test results leads to bias in the assessment of the efficacy of the intervention. Here we consider these issues in the context of a specific version of the 'multiple reasons for testing problem,' motivated by a vaccine trial designed to assess a new Ebola viral disease vaccine (Watson-Jones et al., 2022). Some participants are recruited in the usual TND fashion as they present for care suffering from symptoms consistent with an Ebola diagnosis (and are thus tested); in addition, however, any test-positive identified in this fashion leads to immediate testing for Ebola for all close contacts of the test-positive who likely are asymptomatic at that point. We examine a simple approach to estimate a common efficacy of the vaccine intervention based on these two sources of test positives and test negatives, complemented with an assessment of whether efficacy is the same for both sources.",,,

We collected clinical data using study instruments adapted from a United States based study of LC. Participants were sampled within 2 years of SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis. In Peru, 41.4% participants reported LC symptoms, with no TB-associated significant differences in the prevalence or clinical phenotypes of LC. The most common LC symptoms were neurological (e.g., headache and trouble sleeping) and musculoskeletal (e.g., back pain). Kenyan participants reported acute, but no LC symptoms, and reported a decline in the quality of life during acute infection. In Peru, the post-COVID-19 period was associated with a significant decline in all quality-of-life dimensions (p<0.01), except depression and anxiety (p=0.289). This study shows that LC prevalence was high in Peru, where TB status was not linked to LC symptoms. Those with LC reported high levels of musculoskeletal and neurological symptoms.

This study evaluates the effectiveness of a human-optimized prompt in labeling radiology reports across multiple institutions using LLMs. Six distinct institutions collected 500 radiology reports: 100 in each of 5 categories. A standardized Python script was distributed to participating sites, allowing the use of one common locally executed LLM with a standard human-optimized prompt. The script executed the LLM's analysis for each report and compared predictions to reference labels provided by local investigators. Models' performance using accuracy was calculated, and results were aggregated centrally. The human-optimized prompt demonstrated high consistency across sites and pathologies. Preliminary analysis indicates significant agreement between the LLM's outputs and investigator-provided reference across multiple institutions. At one site, eight LLMs were systematically compared, with Llama 3.1 70b achieving the highest performance in accurately identifying the specified findings. Comparable performance with Llama 3.1 70b was observed at two additional centers, demonstrating the model's robust adaptability to variations in report structures and institutional practices. Our findings illustrate the potential of optimized prompt engineering in leveraging LLMs for cross-institutional radiology report labeling.

Oncology,10.1016/S1470-2045(25)00197-4,"Various locoregional treatments exist for PET-CT-detected pelvic nodal oligorecurrences in patients with prostate cancer. We aimed to assess whether elective nodal radiotherapy (ENRT) to the pelvis would be superior to metastasis-directed therapy (MDT). PEACE V-STORM is a phase 2, open-label, randomised, controlled trial conducted in 21 hospitals in Australia, Belgium, Italy, Norway, Spain, and Switzerland. Eligible participants were aged 18 years or older, with WHO performance status 0-1 and a histologically confirmed initial diagnosis of adenocarcinoma of the prostate, with a PET-detected pelvic nodal oligorecurrence (up to five nodes) following radical local treatment. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to MDT or ENRT. Randomisation was done online by minimisation with randomisation factor 0·80 and was stratified by type of PET tracer (choline vs prostate-specific membrane antigen) and type of MDT used (salvage lymph node dissection vs stereotactic body radiotherapy or simultaneous integrated boost). Participants and researchers were not masked to treatment assignment. Patients in the MDT group had salvage lymph node dissection or stereotactic body radiotherapy (30 Gy in three fractions every other day), with 6 months of androgen deprivation therapy. Patients in the ENRT group received a 45 Gy dose in 25 fractions to the pelvis with a simultaneous integrated boost of 65 Gy to the PET-positive nodes or salvage lymph node dissection, with 6 months of androgen deprivation therapy. The primary endpoint was metastasis-free survival, defined as the time between randomisation and the appearance of a metastatic recurrence (any M1) on PET imaging or death due to any cause, and was analysed per modified intention to treat. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03569241, and the Swiss National Clinical Trials Portal, SNCTP000002947, and is active, not recruiting. Between June 11, 2018, and April 30, 2021, 198 patients were screened for eligibility, 196 of whom were randomly assigned to MDT (n=99) or ENRT (n=97), with 190 evaluable patients (MDT n=97 and ENRT n=93). All patients were male. Data on race and ethnicity were not collected. Median follow-up was 50 months (IQR 42-58). 4-year metastasis-free survival was 63% (80% CI 56-69) in the MDT group and 76% (69-81) in the ENRT group (HR 0·62 [80% CI 0·44-0·86]; p=0·063). The most common grade 3 adverse events were urinary incontinence (six [6%] of 97 in the MDT group vs nine [10%] in the ENRT group) and diarrhoea (one [1%] in the MDT group vs two [2%] in the ENRT group). No treatment-related deaths occurred. To our knowledge, this is the first randomised trial for metachronous PET-detected nodal recurrences comparing two local treatment approaches (MDT and ENRT) in combination with 6 months of androgen deprivation therapy. By showing an improved metastasis-free survival with ENRT, this trial establishes ENRT as a potential standard treatment approach, awaiting a phase 3 trial confirming these results.

Although dermoscopy is the standard non-invasive tool for diagnosing melanoma, it relies on experience and skill. Advances in optical imaging technologies and artificial intelligence have the potential to improve diagnostic accuracy. Our objective was to compare the diagnostic accuracy of novel non-invasive optical imaging techniques for melanoma detection. A systematic literature search was conducted in three databases (Medline, Embase, and CENTRAL) on November 15, 2023. Inclusion criteria focused on studies comparing the accuracy of optical imaging methods against histopathology. Outcomes consisted of measures of diagnostic accuracy. Random-effects meta-analyses were performed for each method with 95% confidence intervals to summarize all relevant effect sizes. Of the 16,239 records, 141 articles met the inclusion criteria, of which 138 articles were eligible for the meta-analysis. Reflectance confocal microscopy (RCM) and dermoscopy combined with artificial intelligence (DSC + AI) had the highest sensitivity (0.93), with DSC + AI showing higher specificity (0.77 [0.70-0.83]) than RCM (0.749 [0.7475-0.7504]). Multispectral imaging combined with AI also showed high sensitivity (0.92 [0.82-0.97]) and relatively high specificity (0.80 [0.67-0.89]). Standalone dermoscopy exhibited balanced sensitivity (0.87 [0.84-0.90]) and specificity (0.82 [0.78-0.86]).

Heart failure,10.1016/j.jchf.2025.02.015,"Diabetic cardiomyopathy (DbCM) is a significant cause of heart failure (HF) in individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Although sex differences are noted in HF patients, it is unclear if such differences exist in those with DbCM and whether sex-based differences affect treatment responses. This analysis focuses on sex differences in baseline characteristics of study participants with DbCM at high risk for progression to overt HF and sex-based treatment responses to high-dose AT-001, a novel aldose reductase inhibitor. The ARISE-HF trial was a Phase 3, randomized, international, placebo-controlled study designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of AT-001 in study participants with DbCM. Of 691 participants, 348 (50.4%) were women. At baseline, women had higher N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide concentrations (92 vs 60 ng/L; P < 0.001), lower peak oxygen uptake (13.87 vs 17.59 mL/kg/min; P < 0.001), shorter cardiopulmonary exercise testing durations (8.47 vs 11.05 minutes; P < 0.001), and worse quality of life and health status (Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire overall summary score 87.79 vs 92.55; P < 0.001; Physical Activity Scale for the Elderly score 137.87 vs 171.09; P < 0.001) compared with men. Despite these differences, there were no significant sex differences in the efficacy or tolerability of high-dose AT-001 compared with placebo. The placebo-corrected oxygen uptake change was 0.26 for women and 0.27 for men (P = 0.58), and changes from baseline to month 15 in Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire and Physical Activity Scale for the Elderly scores showed no significant sex differences (all P > 0.05). Despite baseline differences between women and men with DbCM, the efficacy and safety of high-dose AT-001 are comparable across sexes. These findings highlight the presence of sex-specific characteristics in DbCM and underscore the importance of further research to understand potential sex-specific mechanisms.

Furthermore, optimal therapy is uncertain due to lack of direct comparison of androgen receptor pathway inhibitors (ARPIs) and docetaxel in high-volume disease. To evaluate the use of combination therapy and its association with overall survival among patients with mHSPC and to compare ARPIs vs docetaxel doublet therapy by volume of disease. This retrospective cross-sectional study was conducted in the US Veterans Health Administration among 6216 US veterans with de novo mHSPC from January 1, 2013, to December 31, 2022, treated with androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) within 3 months of diagnosis. Treatments for mHSPC were collected within 4 months of ADT. Volume of disease was assessed from radiology report review. Data were analyzed from July 2023 to October 2024. Overall survival (OS) and clinical progression-free survival (PFS), indicated by time to castration resistance or death. Among 6216 male veterans with mHSPC (mean [SD] age, 73.9 [9.7] years), use of combination therapy increased from 344 of 637 veterans (54.0%) in 2020 to 465 of 737 veterans (63.1%) in 2022. Among 4106 veterans treated from 2017 to 2022, combination therapy was associated with longer OS (40.3 [95% CI, 38.0-42.1] months vs 33.0 [95% CI, 31.2-35.1] months; hazard ratio [HR], 0.80 [95% CI, 0.74-0.87]) and was used more frequently among younger veterans with fewer comorbidities. Among 1174 veterans with high-volume mHSPC, there was no difference in OS between ARPIs and docetaxel (32.3 [95% CI, 29.5-35.3] months vs 34.7 [95% CI, 31.7-37.1] months; HR, 1.06 [95% CI, 0.91-1.23]); however, ARPIs were associated with longer PFS (18.7 [95% CI, 17.1-20.9] months vs 16.0 [95% CI, 14.0-17.7] months; HR, 0.80 [95% CI, 0.70-0.91]; P = .001). In a multivariable model of high-volume mHSPC, there was no difference in OS between ARPIs and docetaxel (adjusted HR, 0.89 [95% CI, 0.76-1.05]). Among 366 veterans with low-volume mHSPC, there was no difference in OS between ARPIs and docetaxel (68.4 [95% CI, 52.6 months to not reached] months vs 55.3 [95% CI, 41.7-78.9] months; HR, 0.81 [95% CI, 0.58-1.13]), but ARPIs were associated with longer PFS (39.7 [95% CI, 34.3-52.9] months vs 24.0 [95% CI, 20.3-32.9] months; HR, 0.57 [95% CI, 0.43-0.76]). In this cross-sectional study of veterans with de novo mHSPC, use of combination therapies increased over time and were associated with longer survival compared with ADT monotherapy.

Twelve prediabetes patients from a physical examination center in Nanchong, China, were recruited using purposive sampling. An interpretive phenomenological research method was employed. Semi-structured, in-depth interviews were conducted to explore patients' self-management experiences. The interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed, and analyzed thematically to develop the results. In addition, web-based information support and peer support facilitated patient self-management. Four overarching themes emerged: (1) cognitive limitations, (2) intrinsic motivation, (3) hurdles to overcome, (4) perceived social support. Revealed the debilitating effect of non-medical terminology expression on the potential harm of the disease, neglect of diagnosis and health education by healthcare providers exacerbated the lack of awareness of prediabetes among patients. The complex social environment (unhealthy food environment, heavy work pressure, etc.) confronts prediabetes with self-management dilemmas. It was also revealed that patients' behavioral change motivation was ""threat-benefit"" dual-driven and was strongly influenced by family ethics, with family culture significantly influencing health decision-making. In addition, web-based information support and peer support facilitate patient self-management. This study investigated the perceptions and self-management experiences of individuals with prediabetes, proposing targeted intervention strategies. Key recommendations include: (1) Healthcare providers' perceptions and attitudes toward prediabetes significantly influence patient engagement, necessitating standardized diagnostic and treatment protocols that emphasize disease progression risks during initial diagnosis to enhance clinical awareness; (2) Implementation of motivational interviewing (MI) techniques could effectively strengthen patients' intrinsic motivation for behavioral modification; (3) Multidimensional support systems should be established through AI-powered medical question-answering systems, standardized nutritional labeling regulations, family-involved health education programs, and peer-led ""health coach"" initiatives. These strategies provide a framework for developing comprehensive prediabetes management interventions aimed at improving self-management ability.",,,

While prior studies have shown a relationship between body mass index (BMI) and cost in total knee arthroplasty (TKA), this question has not been examined using recent data in a nationally-representative dataset. We sought to use recent data to assess the relationship between BMI and cost in TKA. We queried the 2016-2022 PINC AI Healthcare Dataset for primary TKAs identified by the Current Procedural Terminology code 27447. Baseline patient demographics, characteristics, and outcomes were gathered. Patient costs included index and 90-day period costs starting from the surgical encounter. A multivariate generalized linear model estimated patient costs across eight BMI categories (WHO BMI categories, with BMI >40 grouped into BMI 40-45, BMI 45-50, and BMI >50), and a linear regression model assessed the effect of BMI on costs. Both models controlled for age, sex, payer, race, ethnicity, and Elixhauser Comorbidity Index. A total of 24,064 primary TKAs were included. Patient characteristics were age (mean 68 years, SE 0.06), sex (62.3% female), payer (63.8% Medicare), race (88.6% white), ethnicity (3.1% Hispanic), and Elixhauser Comorbidity Index (mean 2.07, SE 0.01). The mean BMI was 32.0 (SE 0.1), with mean index and 90-day costs of $14,051 ± $32.6 and $17,377 ± 107.3, respectively.

However, their performance in Spanish-language medical contexts remains underexplored. This study evaluates the effectiveness of single-agent and multi-agent strategies in answering questions from the EUNACOM, a standardized medical licensure exam in Chile, across 21 medical specialties. GPT-4o was tested on 1,062 multiple-choice questions from publicly available EUNACOM preparation materials. Single-agent strategies included Zero-Shot, Few-Shot, Chain-of-Thought (CoT), Self-Reflection, and MED-PROMPT, while multi-agent strategies involved Voting, Weighted Voting, Borda Count, MEDAGENTS, and MDAGENTS. Each strategy was tested under three temperature settings (0.3, 0.6, 1.2). Performance was assessed by accuracy, and statistical analyses, including Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney U tests, were performed. Computational resource utilization, such as API calls and execution time, was also analyzed. MDAGENTS achieved the highest accuracy with a mean score of 89.97% (SD = 0.56%), outperforming all other strategies (p < 0.001). MEDAGENTS followed with a mean score of 87.99% (SD = 0.49%), and the CoT with Few-Shot strategy scored 87.67% (SD = 0.12%). Temperature settings did not significantly affect performance (F2,54 = 1.45, p = 0.24). Specialty-level analysis showed the highest accuracies in Psychiatry (95.51%), Neurology (95.49%), and Surgery (95.38%), while lower accuracies were observed in Neonatology (77.54%), Otolaryngology (76.64%), and Urology/Nephrology (76.59%). Notably, several exam questions were correctly answered using simpler single-agent strategies without employing complex reasoning or collaboration frameworks. Multi-agent strategies, particularly MDAGENTS, significantly enhance GPT-4o's performance on Spanish-language medical exams, leveraging collaboration to improve diagnostic accuracy. However, simpler single-agent strategies are sufficient to address many questions, high-lighting that only a fraction of standardized medical exams require sophisticated reasoning or multi-agent interaction. These findings suggest potential for LLMs as efficient and scalable tools in Spanish-speaking healthcare, though computational optimization remains a key area for future research.",,,falterma@uc.cl.

This DSE-stratified secondary analysis of ORBITA-2 investigates the relationship between ischemia, assessed by DSE, and the placebo-controlled efficacy of PCI. Participants with angina, single-vessel or multivessel CAD, and ischemia were enrolled. Following discontinuation of antianginal medications, patients were evaluated prerandomization using the ORBITA-app, questionnaires, DSE, and exercise treadmill testing. Stress echocardiography scores were calculated for each left ventricular segment at peak stress, with normal, hypokinetic, akinetic, dyskinetic, and aneurysmal segments scoring 0 to 4, respectively. Bayesian proportional odds modeling was used. Prerandomization DSE data were available for 262 patients. The median age was 65.5 years (Q1-Q3: 59-71 years), and 208 (79.4%) were male. At baseline, the median stress echocardiography score was 1.42 in the PCI group (n = 133) and 1.00 in the placebo group (n = 129), with an overall median score of 1.25 (Q1-Q3: 0.33-2.92). Higher stress echocardiography scores were strongly associated with greater placebo-controlled improvements in angina symptom score following PCI (OR: 1.23; 95% credible interval [CrI]: 1.13-1.35; Pr(interaction) > 99.9%). Higher scores also predicted significant reduction in daily angina episodes (OR: 1.36; 95% CrI: 1.24-1.49; Pr(interaction) > 99.9%), as well as improvement in the Seattle Angina Questionnaire angina frequency score (8.22; 95% CrI: 0.96-15.50; Pr(interaction) = 98.7%), and Seattle Angina Questionnaire quality of life score (8.95; 95% CrI: 2.05-16.00; Pr(interaction) = 99.3%). The relationship between stress echocardiography score and reduction in daily angina episodes remained consistent, irrespective of symptom characteristics. In patients with single- and multivessel stable CAD on little or no antianginal medication, the placebo-controlled efficacy of PCI was predicted by the degree of ischemia detected on DSE. The greater the burden of baseline ischemia, the greater the improvement in symptoms and quality of life with PCI.",Kotecha T; Ruparelia N; Gamma R; ,Essex Cardiothoracic Centre; ; Royal Berkshire NHS Foundation Trust; Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust,m.shun-shin@imperial.ac.uk.
40334987,Artificial Intelligence in the Management of Malnutrition in Cancer Patients: A Systematic Review.,,"Advances in nutrition (Bethesda, Md.)",10.1016/j.advnut.2025.100438,"Malnutrition is a critical complication among cancer patients, affecting ≤80% of individuals depending on cancer type, stage, and treatment. Artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a promising tool in healthcare, with potential applications in nutritional management to improve early detection, risk stratification, and personalized interventions. This systematic review evaluated the role of AI in identifying and managing malnutrition in cancer patients, focusing on its effectiveness in nutritional status assessment, prediction, clinical outcomes, and body composition monitoring. A systematic search was conducted across PubMed, Cochrane Library, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, and Excerpta Medica Database from June to July 2024, following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. Quantitative primary studies investigating AI-based interventions for malnutrition detection, body composition analysis, and nutritional optimization in oncology were included. Study quality was assessed using the Joanna Briggs Institute Critical Appraisal Tools, and evidence certainty was evaluated with the Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine framework. Eleven studies (n = 52,228 patients) met the inclusion criteria and were categorized into 3 overarching domains: nutritional status assessment and prediction, clinical and functional outcomes, and body composition and cachexia monitoring. AI-based models demonstrated high predictive accuracy in malnutrition detection (area under the curve >0.80). Machine learning algorithms, including decision trees, random forests, and support vector machines, outperformed conventional screening tools. Deep learning models applied to medical imaging achieved high segmentation accuracy (Dice similarity coefficient: 0.92-0.94), enabling early cachexia detection. AI-driven virtual dietitian systems improved dietary adherence (84%) and reduced unplanned hospitalizations. AI-enhanced workflows streamlined dietitian referrals, reducing referral times by 2.4 d. AI demonstrates significant potential in optimizing malnutrition screening, body composition monitoring, and personalized nutritional interventions for cancer patients. Its integration into oncology nutrition care could enhance patient outcomes and optimize healthcare resource allocation. Further research is necessary to standardize AI models and ensure clinical applicability. This systematic review followed a protocol registered prospectively on Open Science Framework (https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/A259M).",,,elena.sandri@ucv.es.
40334673,Experiencing digital technologies: The importance of feeling safe in healthcare - A qualitative participatory design.,,Gesundheitswesen (Bundesverband der Arzte des Offentlichen Gesundheitsdienstes (Germany)),10.1055/a-2560-1100,"Digital technologies are increasingly used in healthcare. In this context, perceived safety plays a critical role in their acceptance and implementation. Previous research had focused more on data security or specific digital technologies. There has also been a lack of participatory approaches to consider and empower healthcare recipients (and relatives), providers, and technology experts to broaden the phenomenon.The aim of this study was to present a comprehensive perspective on the needs, influencing factors and related outcomes in the context of feeling safe with digital technologies in healthcare.A qualitative, exploratory, and participatory methodology was used with five guide-based focus group workshops. Each workshop explored one of five digital technology demonstrations provided at the beginning: (1) electronic health records (EHR), (2) robotics, (3) artificial intelligence (AI), (4) smart home, and (5) smart hospital. All participants were invited for a guide-based discussion. The study focused on the levels of 'involvement' and 'collaboration' by also empowering participation. The workshop target groups were actively involved in the development and execution of the workshops and were empowered. The data were analysed via a content analysis approach, with a mostly inductive procedure.Feeling safe was found to affect thoughts, emotions, and actions. For example, a higher level of perceived safety increased the acceptance of digital technologies, whereas a lower level of perceived safety decreased it. The corresponding needs and influencing factors differed in terms of their scope and focus depending on the context. The aspect of 'control' was most frequently addressed by all the target groups and was viewed as relevant in all the workshops. In general, digital technologies were viewed as supplements rather than substitutes for healthcare providers.This study extends beyond the current state of research on perceived safety and the use of digital technologies in healthcare by providing a comprehensive overview of the corresponding needs and influencing factors at various levels, such as the individual, community-organizational, and system-society levels. The perceived safety of healthcare recipients and providers related to digital technologies should be taken into consideration to achieve positive implementation outcomes. Digitale Technologien werden im Gesundheitswesen immer häufiger eingesetzt. Hierbei spielt die wahrgenommene Sicherheit eine entscheidende Rolle für deren Implementierung. Bisherige Forschung konzentrierte sich eher auf die Datensicherheit oder auf spezifische digitale Technologien. Es fehlte ein partizipativer Ansatz, der es Leistungsempfangenden (deren Angehörigen), Leistungserbringenden und Technologieexpert:innen ermöglichte, die Sicht auf das Phänomen zu erweitern.Ziel war es daher erfahrungsbasiert Bedürfnisse, Einflussfaktoren und damit verbundenen Outcomes im Kontext des Sicherheitsgefühls digitaler Technologien im Gesundheitswesen zu erforschen.Es wurde ein qualitatives, exploratives und partizipatives Design, basierend auf fünf leitfadengestützten Fokus-Gruppenworkshops durchgeführt. Eine von fünf digitalen Technologien ((1) elektronische Gesundheitsakten (EHR), (2) Robotik, (3) künstliche Intelligenz (AI), (4) Smart Home und (5) Smart Hospital), wurde zu Beginn oder während des Workshops vorgestellt und/oder konnte ausprobiert werden. Alle Teilnehmenden wurden zu einer leitfadengestützten Diskussion eingeladen. Die Partizipation wurde auf den Ebenen der „Beteiligung“ und „Zusammenarbeit“ gefördert, indem aktiv in die Entwicklung und Durchführung der Workshops einbezogen sowie zur Teilnahme befähigt wurde. Die Daten wurden mit Hilfe induktiver Inhaltsanalyse ausgewertet.Das Gefühl der Sicherheit beeinflusst Gedanken, Gefühle und Handlungen. Beispielsweise kann ein höheres Maß an gefühlter Sicherheit die Akzeptanz digitaler Technologien erhöhen, während ein niedrigeres Maß diese verringern kann. Entsprechende Bedürfnisse und Einflussfaktoren unterschieden sich je nach Kontext in ihrem Umfang und Schwerpunkt. Der Aspekt der „Kontrolle“ wurde von allen Zielgruppen am häufigsten angesprochen und in allen Workshops als relevant angesehen. Digitale Technologien wurden eher als Ergänzung, denn als ein Ersatz für Leistungserbringende betrachtet.Diese Studie geht über den aktuellen Stand der Forschung im Kontext wahrgenommener Sicherheit und digitaler Technologien im Gesundheitswesen hinaus, indem sie einen umfassenden Überblick über die Bedürfnisse und Einflussfaktoren von der individuellen bis hin zur System-/Gesellschaftsebene gibt.

Health care systems are increasingly interested in using these tools for patient education, access to care, and self-management, but need reassurances that AI systems can be secure and credible. This study aimed to build a secure system that people can use to send SMS with questions about substance use, and which can be used to screen for substance use disorder (SUD). The system will rely on data transfer via third party vendors and will thus require reliable and trustworthy encryption of protected health information . We describe the process and specifications for building an AI chatbot that users can access to gain information on and screen for SUD from Be Well Texas, a clinical provider affiliated with the University of Texas Health Sciences Center at San Antonio. The AI chatbot system uses natural language processing and machine learning to classify expert-curated content related to SUD. It illustrates how we can comply with best practices in HIPPA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act) compliance in data encryption for data transfer and data at rest, while still offering a state-of-the-art system that uses dynamic, user-driven conversation to dialogue about SUD, screen for SUD and access SUD treatment services.

This survey aims to assess the current clinical practice of reversal of antithrombotics in the intensive care unit (ICU). An international online 79-item survey was performed among critical care physicians. The survey was disseminated via multiple intensive care societies. Reversal practices for PAI, vitamin K antagonists (VKA), heparins, factor Xa inhibitors, direct thrombin inhibitors (DTI) and fibrinolytics were surveyed. From June 2023 to January 2024, 477 participants started the survey, with 208 completed surveys from 49 countries. The majority (79 %) of respondents practiced ICU medicine in Europe. Only 17 % of the included participants indicated the presence of an ICU-specific antithrombotic reversal protocol in their hospital. Of those, specific protocols were present for 92 % for reversal of VKA, 75 % for unfractioned heparin, 58 % for low-molecular-weight heparin, 53 % for factor Xa inhibitors, 50 % for PAI, 44 % for DTI and 31 % for fibrinolytics. There was heterogeneity in reported reversal practice for different antithrombotics in specific scenarios and between continents. However, dosing strategies of applicable reversal agents were similar. This survey shows variability in the reported clinical approaches to reverse antithrombotic agents in the ICU. The majority of hospitals included do not have a specific protocol for antithrombotic agents reversal emphasizing the need for ICU specific guidelines.",Aubron C; Hunt BJ,Thrombosis and Haemophilia Centre; Médecine Intensive Réanimation,m.c.muller@amsterdamumc.nl.

In this article, we report the associations of tumor mutational burden (TMB) with outcomes of D with or without T in combination with CT versus CT alone. A total of 1013 patients with EGFR/ALK wild-type mNSCLC were randomized (1 : 1 : 1) to T + D + CT, D + CT, or CT, stratified by programmed cell death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) tumor cell (TC) expression ≥50% versus <50%, disease stage (IVA versus IVB) and histology (squamous versus nonsquamous). Patient subgroups were defined by a range of blood TMB (bTMB) values, including at a prespecified cut-off of 20 mutations (mut)/megabase (Mb) and across further subdivisions by PD-L1 TC expression ≥1% or <1% and by tissue TMB (tTMB) values. At the primary OS data cut-off (12 March 2021), at each bTMB or tTMB cut-off, the magnitude of OS benefit appeared greater among patients in the bTMB- or tTMB-high subgroups for the T + D + CT arm versus the CT arm but was similar between subgroups for the D + CT arm versus the CT arm. Updated OS analyses in the bTMB ≥20 and <20 mut/Mb subgroups, after median follow-up of >5 years (data cut-off 24 August 2023), were similar to those obtained at the primary OS data cut-off. First-line treatment with T (limited course) plus D (until progression) and four cycles of CT consistently improved clinical outcomes versus CT alone in both bTMB-high and -low subgroups, and also in both high and low tTMB subgroups, in patients with mNSCLC. Benefit appeared greater in the TMB-high versus TMB-low subgroups; the addition of anti-cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen-4 to anti-PD-L1 and CT seemed to increase the magnitude of this difference.",Oliner KS; L'Hernault A; Ratcliffe M; Madison H; Lai Z; Stewart R; Mann H; Lowery C,AstraZeneca,Solange.Peters@chuv.ch.
40334270,Income-Based Disparities in Perceived Benefits and Challenges of Virtual Global Health Activities During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Mixed Methods Analysis.,2025-05-08,Journal of medical Internet research,10.2196/63066,"Global health activities (GHAs) can potentially reduce health disparities by facilitating resource sharing, promoting medical education and professional development worldwide, and enhancing collaboration among high-income countries (HICs) and low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). However, the COVID-19 pandemic disrupted in-person GHAs due to strict infection control and travel restrictions. To ensure the continuity of GHAs and further address health inequity, virtual GHAs (VGHAs) are gaining traction. Our research aimed to understand how people perceive the benefits and challenges of VGHAs, analyze and compare whether HIC and LMIC respondents have different perceptions of virtual and in-person GHAs, and summarize suggestions for improvement to inform the future development of VGHAs. We conducted a cross-sectional web-based survey during the COVID-19 pandemic in early 2022. Eligible participants were adult students, trainees, or professionals who participated in, created, taught, or facilitated GHAs. We thematically analyzed participants' free-text responses regarding their perceptions of the benefits and challenges of virtual and in-person GHAs. The patterns differed depending on whether respondents were from HICs or LMICs; thus, we compared frequencies of each theme between the 2 groups. A total of 154 respondents from 34 countries were included in the analysis. Key benefits of VGHAs were improved access to global health resources or content, reduced cost, easier scheduling and planning, expanded remote participation, and wider participation and reach. The themes that emerged as challenges of VGHAs included a lack of infrastructure to engage virtually, being less motivated and engaged, a lack of in-person and hands-on experience, and challenges with virtual communication and collaboration. LMIC respondents, compared to HIC counterparts, were more likely to identify reduced cost (26/67, 39% LMIC compared to 20/87, 23% HIC; χ Our findings add to the existing literature by understanding how GHA participants from HICs and LMICs perceive the benefits and challenges of VGHAs differently. These data help elucidate what makes VGHAs acceptable to global health partners and suggest improvements to ensure partner needs are served equitably within the partnership.",,,
40333664,"Exploring the complex nature of implementation of Artificial intelligence in clinical practice: an interview study with healthcare professionals, researchers and Policy and Governance Experts.",,PLOS digital health,10.1371/journal.pdig.0000847,"Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based tools have shown potential to optimize clinical workflows, enhance patient quality and safety, and facilitate personalized treatment. However, transitioning viable AI solutions to clinical implementation remains limited. To understand the challenges of bringing AI into clinical practice, we explored the experiences of healthcare professionals, researchers, and Policy and Governance Experts in hospitals. We conducted a qualitative study with thirteen semi-structured interviews (mean duration 52.1 ± 5.4 minutes) with healthcare professionals, researchers, and Policy and Governance Experts, with prior experience on AI development in hospitals. The interview guide was based on value, application, technology, governance, and ethics from the Innovation Funnel for Valuable AI in Healthcare, and the discussions were analyzed through thematic analysis. Six themes emerged: (1) demand-pull vs. tech-push: AI development focusing on innovative technologies may face limited success in large-scale clinical implementation. (2) Focus on generating knowledge, not solutions: Current AI initiatives often generate knowledge without a clear path for implementing AI models once proof-of-concept is achieved. (3) Lack of multidisciplinary collaboration: Successful AI initiatives require diverse stakeholder involvement, often hindered by late involvement and challenging communication. (4) Lack of appropriate skills: Stakeholders, including IT departments and healthcare professionals, often lack the required skills and knowledge for effective AI integration in clinical workflows. (5) The role of the hospital: Hospitals need a clear vision for integrating AI, including meeting preconditions in infrastructure and expertise. (6) Evolving laws and regulations: New regulations can hinder AI development due to unclear implications but also enforce standardization, emphasizing quality and safety in healthcare. In conclusion, this study highlights the complexity of AI implementation in clinical settings. Multidisciplinary collaboration is essential and requires facilitation. Balancing divergent perspectives is crucial for successful AI implementation. Hospitals need to assess their readiness for AI, develop clear strategies, standardize development processes, and foster better collaboration among stakeholders.",van Dijk JD; Vendel B; Versteeg G,Department of Nuclear Medicine; Appbakkers,

40332991,Comparing Artificial Intelligence-Generated and Clinician-Created Personalized Self-Management Guidance for Patients With Knee Osteoarthritis: Blinded Observational Study.,2025-05-07,Journal of medical Internet research,10.2196/67830,"Knee osteoarthritis is a prevalent, chronic musculoskeletal disorder that impairs mobility and quality of life. Personalized patient education aims to improve self-management and adherence; yet, its delivery is often limited by time constraints, clinician workload, and the heterogeneity of patient needs. Recent advances in large language models offer potential solutions. GPT-4 (OpenAI), distinguished by its long-context reasoning and adoption in clinical artificial intelligence research, emerged as a leading candidate for personalized health communication. However, its application in generating condition-specific educational guidance remains underexplored, and concerns about misinformation, personalization limits, and ethical oversight remain. We evaluated GPT-4's ability to generate individualized self-management guidance for patients with knee osteoarthritis in comparison with clinician-created content. This 2-phase, double-blind, observational study used data from 50 patients previously enrolled in a registered randomized trial. In phase 1, 2 orthopedic clinicians each generated personalized education materials for 25 patient profiles using anonymized clinical data, including history, symptoms, and lifestyle. In phase 2, the same datasets were processed by GPT-4 using standardized prompts. All content was anonymized and evaluated by 2 independent, blinded clinical experts using validated scoring systems. Evaluation criteria included efficiency, readability (Flesch-Kincaid, Gunning Fog, Coleman-Liau, and Simple Measure of Gobbledygook), accuracy, personalization, and comprehensiveness and safety. Disagreements between reviewers were resolved through consensus or third-party adjudication. GPT-4 outperformed clinicians in content generation speed (530.03 vs 37.29 words per min, P<.001). Readability was better on the Flesch-Kincaid (mean 11.56, SD 1.08 vs mean 12.67 SD 0.95), Gunning Fog (mean 12.47, SD 1.36 vs mean 14.56, SD 0.93), and Simple Measure of Gobbledygook (mean 13.33, SD 1.00 vs mean 13.81 SD 0.69) indices (all P<.001), though GPT-4 scored slightly higher on the Coleman-Liau Index (mean 15.90, SD 1.03 vs mean 15.15, SD 0.91). GPT-4 also outperformed clinicians in accuracy (mean 5.31, SD 1.73 vs mean 4.76, SD 1.10; P=.05, personalization (mean 54.32, SD 6.21 vs mean 33.20, SD 5.40; P<.001), comprehensiveness (mean 51.74, SD 6.47 vs mean 35.26, SD 6.66; P<.001), and safety (median 61, IQR 58-66 vs median 50, IQR 47-55.25; P<.001). GPT-4 could generate personalized self-management guidance for knee osteoarthritis with greater efficiency, accuracy, personalization, comprehensiveness, and safety than clinician-generated content, as assessed using standardized, guideline-aligned evaluation frameworks. These findings underscore the potential of large language models to support scalable, high-quality patient education in chronic disease management. The observed lexical complexity suggests the need to refine outputs for populations with limited health literacy. As an exploratory, single-center study, these results warrant confirmation in larger, multicenter cohorts with diverse demographic profiles. Future implementation should be guided by ethical and operational safeguards, including data privacy, transparency, and the delineation of clinical responsibility. Hybrid models integrating artificial intelligence-generated content with clinician oversight may offer a pragmatic path forward.",,,

To address these challenges, we introduce ChatOCT, an offline-capable, domain-adaptive clinical decision support system (CDSS) that integrates structured expert Q&A generation, OCT-specific knowledge injection, and activation-aware model compression. Unlike existing systems, ChatOCT functions without internet access, making it suitable for low-resource environments. ChatOCT is built upon LLaMA-2-7B, incorporating domain-specific knowledge from PubMed and OCT News through a two-stage training process: (1) knowledge injection for OCT-specific expertise and (2) Q&A instruction tuning for structured, interactive diagnostic reasoning. To ensure feasibility in offline environments, we apply activation-aware weight quantization, reducing GPU memory usage to ~ 4.74 GB, enabling deployment on standard OCT hardware. A novel expert answer generation framework mitigates hallucinations by structuring responses in a multi-step process, ensuring accuracy and interpretability. ChatOCT outperforms state-of-the-art baselines such as LLaMA-2, PMC-LLaMA-13B, and ChatDoctor by 10-15 points in coherence, relevance, and clinical utility, while reducing GPU memory requirements by 79%, while maintaining real-time responsiveness (~ 20 ms inference time).

While glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) provide metabolic and neuroprotective benefits, their long-term impact on delirium risk remains uncertain. This study compares GLP-1 RAs and metformin in relation to delirium and mortality in T2DM patients using real-world data. A retrospective cohort study was conducted using the TriNetX global federated research network, which primarily comprises U.S.-based healthcare organisations (approximately 85%), with additional sites in Europe, Asia-Pacific and the Middle East. Adults (≥18 years) with T2DM who initiated GLP-1 RAs or metformin were included. Propensity score matching (PSM) balances baseline characteristics. The primary outcome was incident delirium; the secondary outcome was all-cause mortality. Kaplan-Meier survival curves and time-dependent Cox models assessed associations. After 1:1 PSM (N = 63 096 per group), GLP-1 RAs showed no overall reduction in delirium risk (AHR: 0.98, 95% CI: 0.94-1.02, p = 0.3628). However, they were protective in the first 5 years (AHR: 0.89, 95% CI: 0.86-0.92, p < 0.0001) but increased delirium risk between 5 and 10 years (AHR: 1.15, 95% CI: 1.04-1.26, p = 0.0046). Subgroup analysis revealed lower delirium risk with GLP-1 RAs in middle-aged patients (40-79 years) and those with HbA1c <7.5%. Higher risk was observed in Asian and Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander populations. However, these findings should be interpreted with caution due to the relatively small subgroup sizes and the limited representativeness of these groups within the predominantly U.S.-based database, in which Asian and Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander patients together accounted for less than 5% of the overall cohort. Mortality risk was lower in absolute terms for GLP-1 RAs (6.28% vs. 9.95%) but higher in long-term hazard (AHR: 1.16, 95% CI: 1.12-1.21, p < 0.001). GLP-1 RA use was initially associated with a lower risk of delirium, but this association reversed over time. Subgroup variations suggest individualised treatment considerations.

Machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) models, both key subsets of AI, have demonstrated robust applications across several cardiovascular diseases, from the most diffuse like hypertension and ischemic heart disease to the rare infiltrative cardiomyopathies, as well as to estimation of LDL cholesterol which can be achieved with better accuracy through AI. Additional emerging applications are encountered when unsupervised ML methodology shows promising results in identifying distinct clusters or phenotypes of patients with atrial fibrillation that may have different risks of stroke and response to therapy. Interestingly, since ML techniques do not analyse the possibility that a specific pathology can occur but rather the trajectory of each subject and the chain of events that lead to the occurrence of various cardiovascular pathologies, it has been considered that DL, by resembling the complexity of human brain and using artificial neural networks, might support clinical management through the processing of large amounts of complex information; however, external validity of algorithms cannot be taken for granted, while interpretability of the results may be an issue, also known as a ""black box"" problem.

In light of the rising prevalence of diabetes, there is a growing imperative for the early detection and intervention of DKD. With the rapid development of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, its potential applications in patient education are receiving increasing attention, especially large language models (LLMs). The aim of this study was to evaluate the quality of LLMs-generated patient education materials (PEMs) for early DKD and to explore its feasibility in patient education. Four LLMs (ERNIE Bot 4.0, GPT-4o, ChatGLM4, and ChatGPT-o1) were selected for this study to generate PEMs. Among them, ERNIE Bot 4.0, GPT-4o, and ChatGLM4 generated 2 versions of PEMs based on American Diabetes Association(ADA) guidelines and without ADA guidelines, respectively. ChatGPT-o1 only generated a PEM without ADA guidelines. An experienced physician wrote a PEM based on ADA guidelines. All materials were assessed using a Likert scale which covered the dimensions of accuracy, completeness, safety, and patient comprehensibility. A total of 7 medical experts (including nephrologists and endocrinologists) and 50 diabetic patients were invited to evaluate the study. We recorded basic information on the patient evaluators. Experts evaluated PEMs from ERNIE Bot 4.0, GPT-4o, ChatGLM4, and ChatGPT-o1, plus physician-sourced PEM. Results showed ERNIE Bot 4.0's non-guideline PEM and physician-sourced PEM were the top two. Patient assessments of the 2 top-scoring PEMs found that the ERNIE Bot 4.0's non-guideline PEM performed as well as, if not slightly better than, the physician-sourced PEM in terms of patient comprehensibility, completeness, and safety. In addition, the non-guideline-based PEM was preferred for patients with a history of diabetes longer than 5 years and for patients with proteinuria. Surprisingly, GPT-4o and ChatGLM4's non-guideline PEMs outperformed guideline-based ones. The LLMs-sourced PEMs, especially the ERNIE Bot 4.0's non-guideline PEM for early DKD, performed comparably to the physician-sourced PEM in terms of accuracy, completeness, safety, and patient comprehensibility, and exerted a high degree of feasibility.

This narrow framing has resulted in policies that fail to address the full spectrum of barriers to digital inclusion. To bridge this gap, we propose the Rhizomatic Digital Ecosystem Framework, which emphasizes five interdependent components: access, availability, adequacy, acceptability and affordability. Access highlights the need for physical infrastructure, with programs like the Broadband Equity, Access, and Deployment (BEAD) Program expanding connectivity to underserved areas. Availability ensures the presence of reliable internet infrastructure to meet community needs, with targeted policies like satellite-based solutions addressing challenges in rural and Indigenous areas. Availability policies should focus on federal funding programs like BEAD and the Tribal Broadband Connectivity Program, incentivizing Internet service Providers (ISP) to expand into underserved areas, and leveraging satellite technologies to address infrastructure gaps. Novel policies to address the digital divide include community-owned broadband networks, dynamic spectrum sharing, and blockchain-powered micro-networks to improve availability in underserved areas. Adequacy examines whether internet services meet modern demands, such as telehealth and online education, emphasizing the need for minimum speed standards and performance improvements. Adequacy policies should include enforcing FCC speed standards with regular audits, requiring ISPs to upgrade outdated infrastructure, and providing government grants to improve broadband quality in communities. For adequacy, solutions like AI-driven broadband performance monitoring, funding edge computing in remote regions, and treating broadband as a public utility can enhance internet speed and quality Acceptability tackles cultural and social barriers, including digital literacy gaps, language differences, and technophobia, which can be addressed through localized literacy programs and inclusive design practices. Acceptability policies should prioritize national digital literacy campaigns for underserved groups, mandate inclusive design and accessibility standards, and offer multilingual and culturally relevant resources for digital tools. Affordability addresses financial barriers, as many low-income households struggle to afford monthly internet fees and devices, even with subsidies such as the Affordable Connectivity Program (ACP). To improve acceptability, innovative approaches like universal digital literacy vouchers, gamified education platforms, and mandatory accessibility standards for all digital technologies can ensure equitable and inclusive digital participation. Together, these five dimensions provide a nuanced and actionable framework for crafting effective, interconnected policies and solutions. By addressing each dimension through the lens of the Rhizomatic Digital Ecosystem Framework, policymakers can develop holistic strategies to eliminate the digital divide and foster equitable digital inclusion across all communities.",,,

However, previous studies have not clarified whether altered brain morphology shows sex-specific patterns in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) with or without possible rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (RBD). This study aimed to investigate sex-specific differences in the patterns of morphological changes among different subgroups of PD. High-resolution T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging and clinical scale data were collected from 278 participants in the Parkinson's disease Progression Marker Initiative database: 93 patients with PD-pRBD (60 males, 33 females), 114 patients showing PD without RBD (PDnon-pRBD group; 68 males, 46 females), and 71 healthy controls (HCs; 44 males, 17 females). The Computational Anatomy Toolbox (CAT) 12 was utilized to collect data on gray matter volume (GMV) and cortical morphological metrics. Subsequently, individual-level morphological similarity networks were constructed on the basis of these cortical metrics. Finally, the topological properties of the network were analyzed using graph theoretical methods. In the PD-pRBD group, the GMV in the frontal and temporal lobes of males was lower than that of females. In contrast, the gyrification index (GI) of the frontal lobe in males was lower than that in females within the PDnon-pRBD group. Network analyses based on graph theory revealed that male PD-pRBD patients showed lower network information integration than female patients, particularly in terms of the global properties of fractal dimension (FD) networks. Moreover, in the PD-pRBD group, male patients showed a strong correlation between morphological network metrics and cognitive performance, as measured by the Hopkins Verbal Learning Test-Revised (HVLT The presence of more significant sex-related differences in brain morphological changes in the PD-pRBD group in comparison with the PDnon-pRBD group highlights the importance of considering sex-related differences in the diagnosis and management of patients with PD-pRBD.",Ai K,Department of Clinical and Technical Support,

One promising path that requires further investigation is online self-help interventions and paraprofessional training. Our study aims to evaluate the implementation of delivering ST-informed online self-help interventions (OSI) and paraprofessional training in a naturalistic setting via the 7 Cups platform. Our exploratory, randomised, controlled, pre-post-follow-up study is recruiting two samples of participants: (i) for the ST-informed online self-help/growth path intervention amongst members on the 7 Cups platform, (ii) for the ST-informed online paraprofessional/listener training intervention amongst members who have registered as 'listener' status. The sample size target is N = 200 participants, randomly assigning and comparing 50 OSI member participants to 50 waitlist member participants and 50 paraprofessional/listener training listeners to 50 waitlist listener participants. Our sample size justification, based on previous feasibility studies and guidelines, suggests that a sample size of 50 per group, accounting for a 25% attrition rate, is sufficient to assess feasibility in online family, e-health, and mental health trials, while maintaining narrow margins of error for confidence intervals and primary outcome parameters. The primary outcome is non-specific psychological distress (Kessler Psychological Distress Scale; K6); secondary outcomes include perceived stress, anxiety and depressive symptoms, and momentary mood. To estimate intervention effects, we intend to conduct generalised linear mixed models of primary, and secondary parameters, adjusted for potential covariates (e.g., gender, age categories, socioeconomic status) as fixed effects. Despite the great need for mental health interventions, there is limited research available showing the efficacy of digitally delivered ST-informed interventions.

Current diagnostic systems often face challenges such as limited feature selection capabilities, imbalanced datasets, and computational inefficiencies. This study proposes a novel diagnostic framework TR-ROS-BAT-ML that integrates transfer learning, random sampling, and a BAT algorithm-based optimization strategy with ensemble machine learning classifiers. A dataset comprising 1224 hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)-stained histological images (at 100x and 400x magnifications) of normal oral epithelium and Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma (OSCC) was collected from 230 patients using a Leica ICC50 HD microscopy camera. Pre-trained deep learning models (NANSNetLarge, EfficientNetB7, EfficientNetV2L, EfficientNetV2S, EfficientNetV2M) were employed for feature extraction. To address class imbalance, random oversampling techniques were applied. The BAT algorithm, inspired by bat echolocation behavior, was used for feature selection and hyperparameter tuning. Optimized features were classified using ensemble methods, including XGBoost, AdaBoost, Extra Trees (ET), Histogram-Based Gradient Boosting (HBGC), and MultiLayer Perceptron (MLP). The proposed approach achieved high diagnostic performance across multiple model combinations. The best performance was recorded with the optimized ET model using random oversampling, achieving a recall of 0.992, demonstrating its efficacy in detecting oral lesions. In contrast, the combination of EfficientNetV2S + ROS + MLP yielded the lowest accuracy at 50.8 %. These results confirm the robustness of the TR-ROS-BAT-ML framework in handling imbalanced datasets and optimizing classification performance.

Natural chalcones, known for their diverse bioactivities, have emerged as potential therapeutic candidates. This study aimed to investigate the potential of 4,6-dimethoxy-2,5-quinodihydrochalcone (DODHC), a compound derived from Fissistigma latifolium, in overcoming MDR in cancer and to elucidate its underlying molecular mechanisms. The reversal effects of DODHC on MDR were evaluated using cytotoxicity assays. The molecular mechanisms were explored through apoptosis- and cell cycle-related assays, STAT3 ELISA, western blotting, docking simulations, and a zebrafish model. The impact of DODHC on P-glycoprotein (P-gp) activity was assessed using the Calcein-AM uptake assay. DODHC promoted apoptosis in MDR cancer cells by suppressing survivin expression and activating the extrinsic apoptotic pathway. It also induced G2/M phase cell cycle arrest by downregulating cell division control protein 2 (CDC2) and cyclin B1 (CCNB1), thereby inhibiting cell proliferation. Additionally, DODHC reduced both total and phosphorylated STAT3 levels in MDR cancer cells without affecting P-gp activity.

Long-term monitoring with traditional in-lab testing is impractical due to high costs. Wearable artificial intelligence (AI)-powered solutions offer accessible, scalable, and continuous monitoring, improving the identification and treatment of sleep problems. This scoping review aims to provide an overview of AI-powered wearable devices used for sleep disorders, focusing on study characteristics, wearable technology features, and AI methodologies for detection and analysis. Seven electronic databases (MEDLINE, PsycINFO, Embase, IEEE Xplore, ACM Digital Library, Google Scholar, and Scopus) were searched for peer-reviewed literature published before March 2024. Keywords were selected based on 3 domains: sleep disorders, AI, and wearable devices. The primary selection criterion was the inclusion of studies that utilized AI algorithms to detect or predict various sleep disorders using data from wearable devices. Study selection was conducted in 2 steps: first, by reviewing titles and abstracts, followed by full-text screening. Two reviewers independently conducted study selection and data extraction, resolving discrepancies by consensus. The extracted data were synthesized using a narrative approach. The initial search yielded 615 articles, of which 46 met the eligibility criteria and were included in the final analysis. The majority of studies focused on sleep apnea. Wearable AI was widely deployed for diagnosing and screening disorders; however, none of the studies used it for treatment. Commercial devices were the most commonly used type of wearable technology, appearing in 30 out of 46 (65%) studies. Among these, various brands were utilized rather than a single large, well-known brand; 19 (41%) studies used wrist-worn devices. Respiratory data were used by 25 of 46 (54%) studies as the primary data for model development, followed by heart rate (22/46, 48%) and body movement (17/46, 37%). The most popular algorithm was the convolutional neural network, adopted by 17 of 46 (37%) studies, followed by random forest (14/46, 30%) and support vector machines (12/46, 26%). Wearable AI technology offers promising solutions for sleep disorders. These devices can be used for screening and diagnosis; however, research on wearable technology for sleep disorders other than sleep apnea remains limited.

To establish a mouse intensive care unit to adequately reflect the patient's situation and to investigate sex- and age-related differences in response to lipopolysaccharide. For the establishment of a mouse intensive care unit, young (2-3 months) and old (15-18 months) mice of both sexes received continuous respiratory and cardiovascular monitoring for 6 h. Mimicking an acute lung injury by intratracheal lipopolysaccharide stimulation for 6 or 24 h, the impact of sex and age on survival and physiological parameters was evaluated. The establishment revealed sex- and age-related differences in physiological responses during mechanical ventilation, with old males requiring more noradrenaline to maintain stable hemodynamics. While young mice, irrespective of sex, developed acute lung injury 24 h after lipopolysaccharide administration, old mice exhibited a rapid systemic response, showing signs of lactic acidosis and endotoxemia. Among these, old females had the highest mortality risk, whereas in old males, mechanical ventilation provided effective support, contributing to improved survival outcomes. We successfully established a mouse intensive care unit that integrated all critical aspects of a human intensive care unit simultaneously. By highlighting sex- and age-related differences following lipopolysaccharide stimulation and mechanical ventilation, our study underscored the need for diversity in preclinical models to improve translation of findings on critical illnesses like acute lung injury into clinical settings.",,,heinicke@med.uni-frankfurt.de.

Artificial intelligence (AI), particularly generative AI, has the potential to address these challenges, but its adoption, effectiveness, and barriers to implementation are not well understood. To evaluate the current state of AI adoption in US healthcare systems, assess successes and barriers to implementation during the early generative AI era. This cross-sectional survey was conducted in Fall 2024, and included 67 health systems members of the Scottsdale Institute, a collaborative of US non-profit healthcare organizations. Forty-three health systems completed the survey (64% response rate). Respondents provided data on the deployment status and perceived success of 37 AI use cases across 10 categories. The primary outcomes were the extent of AI use case development, piloting, or deployment, the degree of reported success for AI use cases, and the most significant barriers to adoption. Across the 43 responding health systems, AI adoption and perceptions of success varied significantly. Ambient Notes, a generative AI tool for clinical documentation, was the only use case with 100% of respondents reporting adoption activities, and 53% reported a high degree of success with using AI for Clinical Documentation. Imaging and radiology emerged as the most widely deployed clinical AI use case, with 90% of organizations reporting at least partial deployment, although successes with diagnostic use cases were limited. Similarly, many organizations have deployed AI for clinical risk stratification such as early sepsis detection, but only 38% report high success in this area. Immature AI tools were identified a significant barrier to adoption, cited by 77% of respondents, followed by financial concerns (47%) and regulatory uncertainty (40%). Ambient Notes is rapidly advancing in US healthcare systems and demonstrating early success.

We aimed to study the performance of ChatGPT-4.0, ChatGPT-3.5, and Gemini Advanced across 20 clinicopathologic scenarios in the unexplored realm of gastrointestinal pathology. Materials and methods Twenty clinicopathological scenarios in gastrointestinal pathology were provided to these three large language models. Two fellowship-trained pathologists independently assessed their responses, evaluating both the diagnostic accuracy and confidence of the models. The results were then compared using the chi-squared test. The study also evaluated each model's ability in four key areas, namely, (1) ability to provide differential diagnoses, (2) interpretation of immunohistochemical stains, (3) ability to deliver a concise final diagnosis, (4) and explanation provided for the thought process, using a five-point scoring system. The mean, median score±standard deviation (SD), and interquartile ranges were calculated. A comparative analysis of these four parameters across ChatGPT-4.0, ChatGPT-3.5, and Gemini Advanced was conducted using the Mann-Whitney U test. A p-value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant. Other parameters evaluated were the ability to provide a tumor, node, and metastasis (TNM) stage and the incidence of pseudo-references ""hallucinations"" while citing reference material.

40320548,AI and inclusion in simulation education and leadership: a global cross-sectional evaluation of diversity.,,"Advances in simulation (London, England)",10.1186/s41077-025-00355-1,"Simulation-based medical education (SBME) is a critical training tool in healthcare, shaping learners' skills, professional identities, and inclusivity. Leadership demographics in SBME, including age, gender, race/ethnicity, and medical specialties, influence program design and learner outcomes. Artificial intelligence (AI) platforms increasingly generate demographic data, but their biases may perpetuate inequities in representation. This study evaluated the demographic profiles of simulation instructors and heads of simulation labs generated by three AI platforms-ChatGPT, Gemini, and Claude-across nine global locations. A global cross-sectional study was conducted over 5 days (November 2024). Standardized English prompts were used to generate demographic profiles of simulation instructors and heads of simulation labs from ChatGPT, Gemini, and Claude. Outputs included age, gender, race/ethnicity, and medical specialty data for 2014 instructors and 1880 lab heads. Statistical analyses included ANOVA for continuous variables and chi-square tests for categorical data, with Bonferroni corrections for multiple comparisons: P significant < 0.05. Significant demographic differences were observed among AI platforms. Claude profiles depicted older heads of simulation labs (mean: 57 years) compared to instructors (mean: 41 years), while ChatGPT and Gemini showed smaller age gaps. Gender representation varied, with ChatGPT and Gemini generating balanced profiles, while Claude showed a male predominance (63.5%) among lab heads. ChatGPT and Gemini outputs reflected greater racial diversity, with up to 24.4% Black and 20.6% Hispanic/Latin representation, while Claude predominantly featured White profiles (47.8%). Specialty preferences also differed, with Claude favoring anesthesiology and surgery, whereas ChatGPT and Gemini offered broader interdisciplinary representation. AI-generated demographic profiles of SBME leadership reveal biases that may reinforce inequities in healthcare education. ChatGPT and Gemini demonstrated broader diversity in age, gender, and race, while Claude skewed towards older, White, and male profiles, particularly for leadership roles. Addressing these biases through ethical AI development, enhanced AI literacy, and promoting diverse leadership in SBME are essential to fostering equitable and inclusive training environments.

This article presents a ResNet framework optimized using Henry gas solubility optimization (HGSO) for the classification of brain tumours, resulting in improved classification performance in magnetic resonance images (MRI). Two variants of the deep residual neural network, namely ResNet-18 and ResNet-50, are trained on the MRI training dataset. The four critical hyperparameters of the ResNet model: momentum, initial learning rate, maximum epochs, and validation frequency are tuned to obtain optimal values using HGSO algorithm. Subsequently, the optimized ResNet model is evaluated using two separate databases: Database1, comprising four tumour classes, and Database2, with three tumour classes. The performance is assessed using accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, precision, and F-score. The highest classification accuracy of 0.9825 is attained using the proposed optimized ResNet-50 framework on Database1. Moreover, the Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (GRAD-CAM) algorithm is utilized to enhance the understanding of deep neural networks by highlighting the regions that are influential in making a particular classification decision. Grad-CAM heatmaps confirm the model focuses on relevant tumour features, not image artefacts. This research enhances MRI brain tumour classification via deep learning optimization strategies.",,,

We describe methods for correcting for racial misclassification among non-Hispanic AI/AN (NH-AI/AN) populations using data from the year 2020. We linked National Death Index (NDI) records with the Indian Health Service (IHS) patient registration database to identify AI/AN decedents. Matches were then linked to the National Vital Statistics System (NVSS) mortality data to identify AI/AN individuals that had been misclassified as another race on their death certificates. Analyses were limited to NH-AI/AN and purchased/referred care delivery areas (PRCDA) or urban areas. We compared death rates and counts pre- and post- linkage and calculated sensitivity and classification ratios by region, sex, age, cause of death (COD) and urban area. Racial misclassification on death certificates among NH-AI/AN varied by geographic region. Some of the highest racial misclassification occurred in the Southern Plains and Pacific Coast. Death rates for NH-AI/AN people and differences between NH-AI/AN and Non-Hispanic White (NHW) people were larger using the linked data.

This study focuses on developing an artificial intelligence (AI) based digital pattern recognition system to accurately identify normal penile parameters for circumcision eligibility using a mobile application. Utilizing an Artificial Neural Network (ANN), the AI model was trained on digital images captured by parents or healthcare personnel from dorsal, lateral, and ventral views of the penis. The training employed advanced techniques such as image augmentation and transfer learning to overcome the challenges posed by a limited dataset. Ethical guidelines were strictly adhered to, with informed consent obtained from all participants, ensuring the study's compliance with the Declaration of Helsinki. The AI model, integrated into the Circapproved mobile app, demonstrated high accuracy in classifying normal and abnormal penile conditions, achieving 88.89 % accuracy for the dorsal view, 90.91 % for the lateral view, and 92.5 % for the ventral view. The development pipeline included data preprocessing, data splitting, and augmentation, with the AI model being deployed on a cloud-based platform to ensure scalability and accessibility. The results indicate significant potential for the AI-driven mobile application to facilitate large-scale screening and streamline the circumcision approval process, particularly in resource-limited settings. This approach highlights the potential of AI integration for enhancing the precision of circumcision approval process.

This study aims to develop and evaluate a hybrid AI-based image quality control system to classify slit-lamp images, improving diagnostic accuracy and efficiency, particularly in telemedicine applications. Cross-sectional study. Our Zhejiang Eye Hospital dataset comprised 2982 slit-lamp images as the internal dataset. Two external datasets were included: 13,554 images from the Aier Guangming Eye Hospital (AGEH) and 9853 images from the First People's Hospital of Aksu District in Xinjiang (FPH of Aksu). We developed a Hybrid Prior-Net (HP-Net), a novel network that combines a ResNet-based classification branch with a prior knowledge branch leveraging Hough circle transform and frequency domain blur detection. The two branches' features are channel-wise concatenated at the fully connected layer, enhancing representational power and improving the network's ability to classify eligible, misaligned, blurred, and underexposed corneal images. Model performance was evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, specificity, and F1-score, and compared against the performance of other deep learning models. The HP-Net outperformed all other models, achieving an accuracy of 99.03 %, precision of 98.21 %, recall of 95.18 %, specificity of 99.36 %, and an F1-score of 96.54 % in image classification. The results demonstrated that HP-Net was also highly effective in filtering slit-lamp images from the other two datasets, AGEH and FPH of Aksu with accuracies of 97.23 % and 96.97 %, respectively. These results underscore the superior feature extraction and classification capabilities of HP-Net across all evaluated metrics. Our AI-based image quality control system offers a robust and efficient solution for classifying corneal images, with significant implications for telemedicine applications.

In this cohort study of 770,990 U.S. veterans, seven built environment features were significantly associated with an increased risk of MACE. Two features, old/dilapidated buildings and visible wire, were associated with a decreased risk. Greenery was only linked to increased risk in higher social deprivation index quartiles. Built environment features can serve as predictors of MACE, highlighting the potential role of neighborhood characteristics in cardiovascular risk stratification beyond traditional factors. The relationship between built environment features and major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) in patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) remains understudied. Our study aims to discover what specific built environmental features influence cardiovascular mortality. Retrospective cohort study of US Veterans (2016-2021) (98 % male, 86 % white) with stable ASCVD (coronary artery disease, cerebrovascular disease, or peripheral artery disease). Built environment features were assessed using 164 million Google Street View images (2019) sampled every 50 m across the US. Eleven features, including greenery, sidewalks, and non-single-family homes, were analyzed as the percentage of images containing each element. These were summarized at the census tract level and linked to participant healthcare data via residential addresses. The primary outcome was first MACE occurrence (non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke, or cardiovascular mortality). Associations were analyzed using multivariable Fine Gray models, adjusting for demographics, clinical factors, the social deprivation index, and competing risks. Over a 4-year median follow-up, features associated with increased MACE risk included greenery (subHR: 1.054, 95 % CI: 1.047-1.061), single-lane roads (subHR: 1.059, 95 % CI: 1.054-1.065), sidewalks (subHR: 1.023, 95 % CI: 1.020-1.026), crosswalks (subHR: 1.062, 95 % CI: 1.040-1.083), non-single-family homes (subHR: 1.088, 95 % CI: 1.083-1.094), and two or more cars (subHR: 1.013, 95 % CI: 1.006-1.019).

Poor oral health can lead to significant social, psychological, and physical consequences, which makes early and accurate diagnosis incredibly important. Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) are opening new doors in oral health care, offering faster, more accurate ways to identify dental issues and improve overall care. This paper uses RGB color photography to introduce a non-linear Fuzzy Rank-based Ensemble Deep Learning model (NFR-EDL) for diagnosing oral and dental diseases. The model utilizes four deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) base models to analyze high-resolution color images of the oral cavity. The CNN base models are initially trained to generate confidence scores, which are subsequently mapped onto distinct functions with varying concavities, resulting in non-linear fuzzy ranks. Then, these ranks are combined into a final score to minimize the deviation from expected results. This method aims to provide accurate, reliable identification of oral and dental disease diagnosis by fusing many base models and considering uncertainty in decision-making while utilizing the rich visual information available in RGB images. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed NFR-EDL model achieves accuracies of 97.08 %, 84.00 %, 89.86 %, and 94.66 % on the Kaggle, MOD, ODSI-DB, and OaDD datasets, respectively. These results demonstrate the model's exceptional accuracy and effectiveness in diagnosing oral and dental diseases, outperforming existing techniques and enhancing diagnostic reliability in clinical settings. Deploying the NFR-EDL model in clinical settings offers a highly accurate and reliable tool for diagnosing oral and dental diseases, enhancing early detection, personalizing patient care, and reducing diagnostic errors to ultimately improve patient outcomes and the efficiency of dental care delivery. This approach reduces uncertainty in decision-making, ensuring that diagnoses are made with high confidence.",,,mehdihosseinzadeh@duytan.edu.vn.

This study assessed whether sepsis increases dementia risk and explored a potential dose-response relationship between sepsis frequency and dementia. We conducted a retrospective cohort study using Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Database (2005-2022), enrolling patients aged ≥18 years hospitalized with sepsis. An index period (2008-2013) was used to identify patients without prior dementia. A fixed 12-month landmark period (calendar year 2014) was applied to assess the number of sepsis episodes. Patients who died during the landmark period were excluded. Propensity score matching was performed to generate well-balanced sepsis and non-sepsis groups. Follow-up for dementia and mortality began after the landmark period and continued for up to 64 months. Cox and Fine-Gray models were used to account for competing risks of death. Sepsis was associated with a significantly increased risk of all-cause dementia (HR 1.59; 95 % CI, 1.47-1.72; P < 0.0001). A dose-response relationship was observed: patients with multiple sepsis episodes had the highest dementia risk (sHR 1.63; 95 % CI, 1.39-1.91). Vascular dementia showed the strongest association, with a higher incidence in the sepsis group (1.2 % vs. 0.6 %, P = 0.0003). Our findings provide robust evidence of a dose-dependent association between sepsis and increased dementia risk, particularly vascular dementia, even after adjusting for competing mortality risks. This study addresses the limitations of previous research by not only employing propensity score matching (PSM) to balance confounding factors between the sepsis and non-sepsis groups but also using an index period and landmark period design to better explore potential causal relationships. These periods ensure that dementia onset occurred after sepsis and allow for the examination of dose-response relationship between sepsis episode frequency and dementia. Furthermore, this is the largest study to date involving sepsis patients, providing more robust evidence than prior studies, which were often smaller and lacked adjustments for competing risks of death.",,,szuyuanwu5399@gmail.com.

We aimed to compare the frequency of AMR bacterial pathogens in outpatients with and without cancer. This retrospective cohort study evaluated antimicrobial susceptibility of bacteria isolated from adults (aged ≥18 years) with and without cancer seeking care in 198 outpatient health-care settings in the USA. Data were collected using the BD Insights Research Database. Patients who were not prescribed cancer medications or not admitted to an inpatient cancer unit in the predefined period were categorised as patients without cancer. Patients were included in the cancer cohort if they received medication solely or sometimes indicated for cancer. Data on gender and race or ethnicity were not collected. Non-duplicate and non-contaminant pathogens collected from various samples (ie, blood, intra-abdominal, respiratory, urine, skin or wound, and other) in outpatients were used to assess the coprimary outcomes: overall and source-specific proportions of non-susceptible pathogen isolates with corresponding AMR odds ratios (ORs); and rates of AMR pathogens per 1000 isolates with corresponding AMR incidence rate ratio (IRR) in patients with and without cancer.

To evaluate how AI model explanations influence clinicians' mental models, trust, and satisfaction regarding machine learning-based predictions of Intensive Care Unit (ICU) Length of Stay (LOS). This retrospective mixed-methods study analyzed electronic health record data from 8,579 patients admitted to a surgical ICU in South Korea between 2019 and 2022. Seven machine learning models were developed and evaluated to predict ICU LOS at 2-hour intervals during the initial 12 hours post-admission. The Random Forest (RF) model in the 10- to 12-hour window, with an AUROC of 0.903, was selected for explanation using SHapley Additive exPlanations. Fifteen ICU clinicians assessed four distinct types of explanations ('Why', 'Why not', 'How to', and 'What if') via web-based experiments, surveys, and interviews. Clinicians' feature selections aligned more closely with the RF model after explanations, as demonstrated by an increase in Spearman correlation from -0.147 (p = 0.275) to 0.868 (p < 0.001). The average trust score improved from 2.8 to 3.9. The average satisfaction scores for the 'Why', 'Why not', 'How to', and 'What if' explanations were 3.3, 3.8, 3.6, and 4.1, respectively. AI model explanations notably enhanced clinicians' understanding and trust in AI-generated ICU LOS predictions, although complete alignment with their mental models was not achieved.

In this paper, I explore one long-term risk of such selective deployment for certain small underrepresented groups, such as those with rare diseases. The risk in question is the potential long-term decline in the human expertise critical for such small groups, which, because they are excluded from effective care by the algorithm, would still rely on non-algorithmic, human expertise even in the long run. I then discuss how to best preserve human expertise and maintain long-term access to quality care for excluded groups and contend that such expertise preservation is essential for ethical deployment of algorithmic processes in healthcare.",,,

Effective integration of AI technologies in military health care education requires military health care educators that are willing to learn how to safely, effectively, and ethically use AI technologies in their own administrative, educational, research, and clinical roles. Together with health care trainees, these faculties can help to build and co-create AI-integrated curricula that will accelerate and enhance the military health care curriculum of tomorrow. Trainees can begin to use generative AI tools, like large language models, to begin to develop their skills and practice the art of generating high-quality AI tools that will improve their studies and prepare them to improve military health care. Integration of AI technologies in the military health care environment requires close military-industry collaborations with AI and security experts to ensure personal and health care information security. Through secure cloud computing, blockchain technologies, and Application Programming Interfaces, among other technologies, military health care facilities and systems can safely integrate AI technologies to enhance patient care, clinical research, and health care education. AI technologies are not a dream of the future, they are here, and they are being integrated and implemented in military health care systems. To best prepare the military health care professionals of the future for the reality of medical AI, we must reform military health care education through a combined effort of faculty, students, and industry partners.",,,
40317226,Prototyping Intelligent Software Solutions for Global Health Engagement.,,Military medicine,10.1093/milmed/usaf164,"Understanding the Global Health Engagement (GHE) landscape is the key to effective military planning and execution across tactical, operational, and strategic levels. Global Health Engagements are intended to both help partner nations achieve the capacity, capability, and interoperability necessary to provide care to their own and also delivering an appropriate standard of care to U.S. service members, when needed. As standards and capabilities vary globally, planning GHEs is increasingly data-driven, relying on sources focused on GHE information requirements as well as those focused on GHE-supportive information needs. Current challenges to the use of GHE data in planning and crisis management are its lack of availability, standardization, integration, and visualization. Solving these challenges requires improved data curation, analysis, and user interface design to properly optimize engagements and care delivery. Our research focused on supporting the Center for Global Health Engagement's (CGHE) ability to effectively plan, execute, and track a range of these engagements across the tactical, operational, and strategic levels. We leveraged Machine Learning (ML) capabilities including Large Language Models (LLMs) to assist users in making sense of large and disparate datasets. Our solution focused on automating the ingestion of data from unstructured text (GHE surveys), establishing a unified and standardized data format, developing interactive analytic tools, and presenting the results through user-specific visualizations to support decision-making and risk-informed course of action recommendations. To curate, analyze, and visualize GHE data, we developed a prototype ML algorithm that employs an LLM for global health tactical-level hospital data ingestion, curation aggregation, and analysis and displays results for patient distribution in response to a crisis scenario using a 3D geospatial mapping visualization tool. The resulting capability uses an advanced, adaptive User Interface to visualize outputs from the ML algorithm, including providing explanations in a human-readable format on how the algorithm arrived at these outputs. The results provide practical applications for proof of concept of AI assistance in supporting global health data processing and analysis, with applications extending to the biosurveillance, medical countermeasures, and medical logistics domains. This study has direct implications for understanding partner healthcare capabilities and integrating them into military healthcare plans to support military and medical decision-making for operational planning, crisis management and conflict healthcare delivery and the planning and execution of future health engagements.",Sussman-Fort J; Glenister L; Jankowski D; Petroff N; Cohn CJ,Soar Technology,

In the ARISE-HF trial, the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ), cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET), Physical Activity Scale for the Elderly (PASE) score, echocardiographic, and laboratory assessments were performed at baseline in 691 persons with DbCM. Study participants with lower KCCQ-Clinical Summary Score (CSS) were predominantly women, had poorer kidney function, higher body-mass index and natriuretic peptides, and lower hemoglobin levels. Lower KCCQ-CSS scores were associated with shorter CPET duration, lower peak exercise oxygen consumption (VO₂) and lower PASE scores, but the correlations were weak (CPET duration: r = 0.14, 95 % CI: 0.07-0.22; peak VO₂: r = 0.21, 95 % CI: 0.14-0.28; PASE score: r = 0.19, 95 % CI: 0.11-0.26), indicating that although worse health status was linked to poorer function and activity, the strength of these relationships was limited. No meaningful associations were observed between KCCQ-CSS and echocardiographic measurements, cardiac biomarkers, or kidney function. Health status in Stage B heart failure due to DbCM is frequently impaired.

We aimed to evaluate the ability of ChatGPT, an LLM, to generate physician and patient letters from clinical case notes. Six oncologists created 29 (four training, 25 final) synthetic oncology case notes. Structured prompts for ChatGPT were iteratively developed using the four training cases; once finalized, 25 physician-directed and patient-directed letters were generated. These underwent evaluation by expert consumers and oncologists for accuracy, relevance, and readability using Likert scales. The patient letters were also assessed with the Patient Education Materials Assessment Tool for Print (PEMAT-P), Flesch Reading Ease, and Simple Measure of Gobbledygook index. Among physician-to-physician letters, 95% (119/125) of oncologists agreed they were accurate, comprehensive, and relevant, with no safety concerns noted. These letters demonstrated precise documentation of history, investigations, and treatment plans and were logically and concisely structured. Patient-directed letters achieved a mean Flesch Reading Ease score of 73.3 (seventh-grade reading level) and a PEMAT-P score above 80%, indicating high understandability.

We utilized contrast-enhanced and non-enhanced abdominal, chest, and whole-body CT images for model development. External testing involved paired pre- and post-contrast abdominal CT images from another hospital. We developed 3D nnU-Net models to segment the gastrointestinal tract and separate it into the esophagus, stomach, small bowel, and large bowel. Segmentation accuracy was evaluated using the Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) based on radiologists' segmentation. We employed the network to estimate LBL in individuals having abdominal CT for health check-ups, and the height-corrected LBL was compared between groups with and without constipation. One hundred thirty-three CT scans (88 patients; age, 63.6 ± 10.6 years; 39 men) were used for model development, and 60 for external testing (30 patients; age, 48.9 ± 15.8 years; 16 men). In the external dataset, the mean DSC for the entire gastrointestinal tract was 0.985 ± 0.008. The mean DSCs for four-part separation exceeded 0.95, outperforming TotalSegmentator, except for the esophagus (DSC, 0.807 ± 0.173). For LBL measurements, 100 CT scans from 51 patients were used (age, 67.0 ± 6.9 years; 59 scans from men; 59 with constipation). The height-corrected LBL were significantly longer in the constipation group on both per-exam (79.1 ± 12.4 vs 88.8 ± 15.8 cm/m, p = 0.001) and per-subject basis (77.6 ± 13.6 vs 86.9 ± 17.1 cm/m, p = 0.04). Our model accurately segmented the entire gastrointestinal tract and its major compartments from CT scans and enabled the noninvasive estimation of LBL in individuals with constipation. Questions Automated bowel segmentation is a first step for algorithms, including bowel tracing and length measurement, but the complexity of the gastrointestinal tract limits its accuracy. Findings Our 3D nnU-Net model showed high performance in segmentation and four-part separation of the GI tract (DSC > 0.95), except for the esophagus. Clinical relevance Our model accurately segments the gastrointestinal tract and separates it into major compartments.

Objective standardization of placental structure is crucial for easing the burden on pathologists, gaining deeper insights into placental growth and adaptation, and ultimately improving maternal and fetal health outcomes. Leveraging advancements in deep-learning segmentation, we developed an automated approach to detect over 9 million placenta chorionic villi from 1,531 term placental whole slide images from the New Hampshire Birth Cohort Study. Using unsupervised clustering, we successfully identified biologically relevant villi subtypes that align with previously reported classifications - terminal, mature intermediate, and immature intermediate - demonstrating consistent size distributions and comparable abundance. We additionally defined tertile-based combinations of villi area and circularity to characterize villous geometry. This study applies these cutting-edge AI methods to quantify villi features and examine their association with maternal and infant characteristics, including gestational age at delivery, maternal age, and infant sex. Increasing gestational age at delivery was statistically significantly associated (p=0.003) with an increase in the proportion of mature intermediate villi and a decrease in the proportion of the smallest, most circular villi (p < 0.001).

Advocates propose that AI can bridge gaps in care delivery and access, improving healthcare quality and reducing inequity, including in resource-constrained settings. A broad base of critical scholarship has highlighted important issues with healthcare AI, including algorithmic bias and inequitable and inaccurate model outputs. While such criticisms are valid, there exists a much more fundamental challenge that is often overlooked in global health policy debates: the dangerous mismatch between AI's imagined benefits and the material realities of healthcare systems globally. AI cannot be deployed effectively or ethically in contexts lacking sufficient social and material infrastructure and resources to provide effective healthcare services. Continued investments in AI within unprepared, under-resourced contexts risk misallocating resources and potentially causing more harm than good. The article concludes by providing concrete questions to assess AI systemic capacity and socio-technical readiness in global health.",,,a.fiske@tum.de.

Digital health,10.1016/j.landig.2025.02.008,"Improving the accessibility of screening diabetic kidney disease (DKD) and differentiating isolated diabetic nephropathy from non-diabetic kidney disease (NDKD) are two major challenges in the field of diabetes care. We aimed to develop and validate an artificial intelligence (AI) deep learning system to detect DKD and isolated diabetic nephropathy from retinal fundus images. In this population-based study, we developed a retinal image-based AI-deep learning system, DeepDKD, pretrained using 734 084 retinal fundus images. First, for DKD detection, we used 486 312 retinal images from 121 578 participants in the Shanghai Integrated Diabetes Prevention and Care System for development and internal validation, and ten multi-ethnic datasets from China, Singapore, Malaysia, Australia, and the UK (65 406 participants) for external validation. Second, to differentiate isolated diabetic nephropathy from NDKD, we used 1068 retinal images from 267 participants for development and internal validation, and three multi-ethnic datasets from China, Malaysia, and the UK (244 participants) for external validation. Finally, we conducted two proof-of-concept studies: a prospective real-world study with 3 months' follow-up to evaluate the effectiveness of DeepDKD in screening DKD; and a longitudinal analysis of the effectiveness of DeepDKD in differentiating isolated diabetic nephropathy from NDKD on renal function changes with 4·6 years' follow-up. For detecting DKD, DeepDKD achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0·842 (95% CI 0·838-0·846) on the internal validation dataset and AUCs of 0·791-0·826 across external validation datasets. For differentiating isolated diabetic nephropathy from NDKD, DeepDKD achieved an AUC of 0·906 (0·825-0·966) on the internal validation dataset and AUCs of 0·733-0·844 across external validation datasets. In the prospective study, compared with the metadata model, DeepDKD could detect DKD with higher sensitivity (89·8% vs 66·3%, p<0·0001). In the longitudinal study, participants with isolated diabetic nephropathy and participants with NDKD identified by DeepDKD had a significant difference in renal function outcomes (proportion of estimated glomerular filtration rate decline: 27·45% vs 52·56%, p=0·0010).

To examine racial and ethnic disparities in receipt of ERBB2-targeted therapies and changes in receipt over time. This retrospective cohort study used Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results-Medicare linked data from January 1, 2010, to December 31, 2020. Beneficiaries who were diagnosed with ERBB2-positive breast cancer between 2010 and 2019, were aged 66 years or older at diagnosis, were continuously enrolled in Medicare Parts A and B in the 12 months before and after diagnosis, and had localized or regional stage disease at diagnosis were included. Data were analyzed from February through September 2024. Race and ethnicity defined as non-Hispanic Black or African American, Hispanic, or non-Hispanic White. The primary outcome was receipt of ERBB2-targeted therapies in the 12 months after diagnosis of ERBB2-positive breast cancer. Modified Poisson regression was used to evaluate the probability of receiving ERBB2-targeted therapy by race and ethnicity. Among 12 765 beneficiaries with ERBB2-positive breast cancer (median [IQR] age, 74 [69-80] years; 99.2% female), 8.1% were of Black, 6.9% Hispanic, and 85.0% White race and ethnicity, and 54.2% received ERBB2-targeted therapy. The overall proportion who received ERBB2-targeted therapies increased from 41.3% in 2010-2011 to 64.3% in 2018-2019. Compared with White patients, Black patients had a lower likelihood of receiving ERBB2-targeted therapies in 2010-2011 (adjusted risk ratio [ARR], 0.81; 95% confidence limit [CL], 0.68-0.97), as did Hispanic patients (ARR, 0.75; 95% CL, 0.62-0.92).

40308410,Obesity-Related Phenotype of Heart Failure With Preserved Ejection Fraction: A Comprehensive Review.,,Cureus,10.7759/cureus.81512,"Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) is a complex clinical syndrome with an obesity-related phenotype gaining prominence amid the global obesity epidemic. This review explores the distinct pathophysiological mechanisms, diagnostic challenges, and management strategies associated with obesity-induced HFpEF. Obesity contributes to HFpEF through several key mechanisms, including increased blood volume, myocardial hypertrophy and fibrosis, systemic inflammation, and metabolic dysregulation. These factors collectively exacerbate diastolic dysfunction and elevate left ventricular filling pressures, hallmark features of HFpEF. Diagnosing HFpEF in obese patients is particularly challenging due to overlapping comorbidities such as hypertension and diabetes, as well as the reduced reliability of traditional biomarkers such as N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide. Advanced imaging techniques are crucial in assessing diastolic dysfunction and myocardial remodeling. Managing obesity-related HFpEF requires a comprehensive approach. Lifestyle modifications, including weight loss and exercise, form the cornerstone of treatment, complemented by pharmacological therapies such as sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists. Optimizing comorbidity management is essential, while emerging therapies targeting inflammation, fibrosis, and metabolic dysfunction, alongside precision medicine approaches, offer promising future advancements. This review underscores the need for inclusive clinical trials and personalized treatment strategies to improve outcomes in obesity-related HFpEF.

In this participant-level pooled analysis of 3 large clinical trials, the authors evaluated the effect of the nonsteroidal MRA finerenone on incident AF/AFL across the cardio-kidney-metabolic (CKM) spectrum. In this prespecified analysis, we pooled participants from 2 trials of chronic kidney disease and type 2 diabetes (FIDELIO-DKD and FIGARO-DKD) and a trial of heart failure (HF) with mildly reduced or preserved ejection fraction (FINEARTS-HF). Patients were randomized 1:1 to finerenone or placebo. New-onset AF/AFL was prospectively adjudicated in all trials by blinded clinical event committees. The risk of new-onset AF/AFL was evaluated using Cox regression models stratified by region and trial. Among 14,581 patients who were free of AF/AFL at trial enrollment, 631 (4.3%) experienced new-onset AF/AFL during follow-up. Predictors of new-onset AF/AFL included older age, history of HF, higher body mass index, geographic region, and higher levels of urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio. During 2.9 years of median follow-up, new-onset AF/AFL occurred in 286 (3.9%) participants receiving finerenone and 345 (4.7%) assigned to placebo (HR: 0.83; 95% CI: 0.71-0.97; P = 0.019).

40306630,New Performance Measurement Framework for Realizing Patient-Centered Clinical Decision Support: Qualitative Development Study.,2025-05-01,Journal of medical Internet research,10.2196/68674,"Patient-centered clinical decision support (PC CDS) exists on a continuum that reflects the degree to which its knowledge base, data, delivery, and use focus on patient needs and experiences. A new focus on value-based, whole-person care has resulted in broader development of PC CDS technologies, yet there is limited information on how to measure their performance and effectiveness. To address these gaps, there is a need for more measurement guidance to assess PC CDS interventions. This paper presents a new framework that incorporates patient-centered principles into traditional health IT and clinical decision support (CDS) evaluation frameworks to create a unified guide to PC CDS performance measurement. We conducted a targeted literature review of 147 sources on health IT, CDS, and PC CDS measurement and evaluation to develop the framework. Sources were reviewed if they included the sociotechnical components relevant to PC CDS, covered the full IT life cycle of PC CDS, and addressed measurement considerations at different user and system levels. We then validated and refined the measurement framework through key informant interviews with 6 experts in measurement, CDS, and clinical informatics. Throughout the framework development, we gathered feedback from a 7-member expert committee on the methods, findings, and the framework's relevance and application. The PC CDS performance measurement framework includes 6 domains: safe, timely, effective, efficient, equitable, and patient centered. The 6 domains contain 34 subdomains that can be selected to assess performance, depending on the type of PC CDS intervention or the specific research focus. In addition, there are 4 levels of aggregation at which subdomains can be measured (individual, population, organization, or IT system) that account for the multilevel impact of PC CDS. We provide examples of measures and approaches to patient centeredness for each subdomain, followed by 2 illustrative use cases demonstrating the framework application. This framework can be used by researchers, health system leaders, informaticians, and patients to understand the full breadth of performance and impact of PC CDS technology. The framework is significant in that it (1) covers the entire PC CDS life cycle, (2) has a direct focus on the patient, (3) covers measurement at different levels, (4) encompasses 6 independent but related domains, and (5) requires additional research and development to fully characterize all domains and subdomains. As the field of PC CDS matures, researchers and evaluators can build upon the framework to assess which components of PC CDS technologies work; whether PC CDS technologies are being used as anticipated; and whether the intended outcomes of delivering evidence-based, patient-centered care are being achieved.",Sittig DF,Informatics Review,

Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) have emerged as promising tools to optimize triage. This systematic review evaluates AI/ML-driven triage and risk stratification models in EDs, focusing on predictive performance, key predictors, clinical and operational outcomes, and implementation challenges. Following PRISMA 2020 guidelines, we systematically searched PubMed, CINAHL, Scopus, Web of Science, and IEEE Xplore for studies on AI/ML-driven ED triage published through January 2025. Two independent reviewers screened studies, extracted data, and assessed quality using PROBAST, with findings synthesized thematically. Twenty-six studies met inclusion criteria. ML-based triage models consistently outperformed traditional tools, often achieving AUCs > 0.80 for high acuity outcomes (e.g., hospital admission, ICU transfer). Key predictors included vital signs, age, arrival mode, and disease-specific markers. Incorporating free-text data via natural language processing enhances accuracy and sensitivity. Advanced ML techniques, such as gradient boosting and random forests, generally surpassed simpler models across diverse populations. Reported benefits included reduced ED overcrowding, improved resource allocation, fewer mis-triaged patients, and potential patient outcome improvements. AI/ML-based triage models hold substantial promise in improving ED efficiency and patient outcomes. Prospective, multi-center trials with transparent reporting and seamless electronic health record integration are essential to confirm these benefits. Integrating AI and ML into ED triage can enhance assessment accuracy and resource allocation. Early identification of high-risk patients supports better clinical decision-making, including critical care and ICU nurses, by streamlining patient transitions and reducing overcrowding. Explainable AI models foster trust and enable informed decisions under pressure. To realize these benefits, healthcare organizations must invest in robust infrastructure, provide comprehensive training for all clinical staff, and implement ethical, standardized practices that support interdisciplinary collaboration between ED and ICU teams.",,,r.adel@almoosacollege.edu.sa.

AI has brought many positives to medical imaging services and is far superior at making calculations using vast amounts of data. It can therefore help improve the speed and accuracy of diagnosis and treatment plans for many patients, but at what cost to the radiography profession? Surveys have shown that the majority of the workforce welcome AI, but admit that they don't fully understand the principles behind it. AI developers are keen to improve patient output, and many are unconcerned about the possible negative effects on staff morale and expertise. As computers remove the autonomy and competency that radiographers have previously held with pride, staff may find that they become de-skilled and de-motivated, and it may eventually subsume the traditional role of the radiographer altogether. The profession needs to be aware of these potential impacts and prepare accordingly. Higher education plays an important role in preparing radiographers of the future for the changing landscape of medical imaging and should include more engineering and data science modules in the curriculum to prevent radiographers from becoming irrelevant.",,,N.A.Gale@exeter.ac.uk.

This study sought to examine PrEP knowledge, attitudes, and perceived barriers to use among AI/AN people in the United States. A cross-sectional, online survey was administered from January-May 2023 to respondents ≥ 16 years of age who identified as AI/AN. The survey assessed sociodemographic characteristics, PrEP knowledge, attitudes towards PrEP, and experiences with and barriers to PrEP use. Sociodemographic correlates of PrEP knowledge and attitudes were identified using bivariable and multivariable regression models. The survey enrolled 403 participants and 354 (87.8%) completed all questions. Respondents had relatively low PrEP knowledge (mean score 4.0 of 9, standard deviation [SD] 3.0). Few (7%) had ever used PrEP. Mean scores on the stigma scales were 2.1 of 5 for stigmatizing PrEP attitudes (SD 0.7), 2.4 of 5 for anticipated stigma (SD 0.56), and 3.0 of 5 for perceived stigma (SD 0.38). Among non-users, 43.1% were not sure if they would be able to get a PrEP prescription if they desired, and 2.7% believed they would not be able to get one. The most common perceived barriers were not knowing where to get PrEP (54.7%) and concerns around discomfort, judgement, and privacy at the health facility (27.3%). In adjusted models, living on tribal/reservation lands was significantly associated with lower PrEP knowledge, higher stigmatizing attitudes, and higher anticipated stigma, and lower PrEP knowledge was associated with higher stigmatizing attitudes and anticipated stigma. Age, gender identity, sexual orientation, urban residence, and strength of connection to indigenous culture were also significantly correlated with one or more outcomes. Our findings underscore the need for widespread sensitization about PrEP in Indigenous communities and for strategies to improve PrEP access and reduce stigma from providers and community members.",Roberts ST; Browne EN; Reilley B; Hoover A; Leston J,Women's Global Health Imperative; Northwest Portland Area Indian Health Board,

It seeks to aid their understanding of Generative AI's current capabilities, applications, and limitations within the medical field. Generative AI models, distinct from discriminative models, are designed to create novel synthetic data. Key model families discussed include diffusion models for generating images and videos, Large Language Models (LLMs) for text, and Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) capable of processing multiple data types. Recent applications in healthcare are diverse, encompassing general uses like generating synthetic medical images, automating clinical documentation, and creating synthetic audio/video for training. More specialized applications include leveraging Generative AI models as backbones for diagnostic aids, enhancing information retrieval through Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines, and coordinating multiple AI agents in complex workflows. Generative AI holds significant transformative potential in medicine, enhancing capabilities across imaging, documentation, education, and decision support.

Typically, the extensive use of antibiotics has been thought to increase selective pressures, leading to resistance. This study explores scenarios where expanded antibiotic treatment can be advantageous for both individual and population health. We develop a mathematical framework to assess the impacts on outbreak dynamics of choosing to treat moderate infections not treated under current guidelines, focusing on cholera as a case study. We derive conditions under which treating moderate infections can sufficiently decrease transmission and reduce the total number of antibiotic doses administered. We identify two critical thresholds: the Outbreak Prevention Threshold (OPT), where expanded treatment reduces the reproductive number below 1 and halts transmission, and the Dose Utilization Threshold (DUT), where expanded treatment results in fewer total antibiotic doses used than under current guidelines. For cholera, we find that treating moderate infections can feasibly stop an outbreak when the untreated reproductive number is less than 1.42 and will result in fewer does used compared to current guidelines when the untreated reproductive number is less than 1.53. These findings demonstrate that conditions exist under which expanding treatment to include moderate infections can reduce disease spread and the selective pressure for antibiotic resistance. These findings extend to other pathogens and outbreak scenarios, suggesting potential targets for optimized treatment strategies that balance public health benefits and antibiotic stewardship.",,,lindsay.keegan@utah.edu.

40301302,Multipronged SMAD pathway targeting by lipophilic poly(β-amino ester) miR-590-3p nanomiRs inhibits mesenchymal glioblastoma growth and prolongs survival.,2025-04-30,Signal transduction and targeted therapy,10.1038/s41392-025-02223-w,"Despite aggressive therapy, glioblastoma (GBM) recurs in almost all patients and treatment options are very limited. Despite our growing understanding of how cellular transitions associate with relapse in GBM, critical gaps remain in our ability to block these molecular changes and treat recurrent disease. In this study we combine computational biology, forward-thinking understanding of miRNA biology and cutting-edge nucleic acid delivery vehicles to advance targeted therapeutics for GBM. Computational analysis of RNA sequencing from clinical GBM specimens identified TGFβ type II receptor (TGFBR2) as a key player in the mesenchymal transition associated with worse outcome in GBM. Mechanistically, we show that elevated levels of TGFBR2 is conducive to reduced temozolomide (TMZ) sensitivity. This effect is, at least partially, induced by stem-cell driving events coordinated by the reprogramming transcription factors Oct4 and Sox2 that lead to open chromatin states. We show that blocking TGFBR2 via molecular and pharmacological approaches decreases stem cell capacity and sensitivity of clinical recurrent GBM (rGBM) isolates to TMZ in vitro. Network analysis uncovered miR-590-3p as a tumor suppressor that simultaneously inhibits multiple oncogenic nodes downstream of TGFBR2. We also developed novel biodegradable lipophilic poly(β-amino ester) nanoparticles (LiPBAEs) for in vivo microRNA (miRNAs) delivery. Following direct intra-tumoral infusion, these nanomiRs efficiently distribute through the tumors. Importantly, miR-590-3p nanomiRs inhibited the growth and extended survival of mice bearing orthotopic human rGBM xenografts, with an apparent 30% cure rate. These results show that miRNA-based targeted therapeutics provide new opportunities to treat rGBM and bypass the resistance to standard of care therapy.",,,green@jhu.edu.
40301283,Using Generative Artificial Intelligence in Health Economics and Outcomes Research: A Primer on Techniques and Breakthroughs.,,PharmacoEconomics - open,10.1007/s41669-025-00580-4,"The emergence of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) offers the potential to enhance health economics and outcomes research (HEOR) by streamlining traditionally time-consuming and labour-intensive tasks, such as literature reviews, data extraction, and economic modelling. To effectively navigate this evolving landscape, health economists need a foundational understanding of how GenAI can complement their work. This primer aims to introduce health economists to the essentials of using GenAI tools, particularly large language models (LLMs), in HEOR projects. For health economists new to GenAI technologies, chatbot interfaces like ChatGPT offer an accessible way to explore the potential of LLMs. For more complex projects, knowledge of application programming interfaces (APIs), which provide scalability and integration capabilities, and prompt engineering strategies, such as few-shot and chain-of-thought prompting, is necessary to ensure accurate and efficient data analysis, enhance model performance, and tailor outputs to specific HEOR needs. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) can further improve LLM performance by incorporating current external information. LLMs have significant potential in many common HEOR tasks, such as summarising medical literature, extracting structured data, drafting report sections, generating statistical code, answering specific questions, and reviewing materials to enhance quality. However, health economists must also be aware of ongoing limitations and challenges, such as the propensity of LLMs to produce inaccurate information ('hallucinate'), security concerns, issues with reproducibility, and the risk of bias. Implementing LLMs in HEOR requires robust security protocols to handle sensitive data in compliance with the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the United States' Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). Deployment options such as local hosting, secure API use, or cloud-hosted open-source models offer varying levels of control and cost, each with unique trade-offs in security, accessibility, and technical demands. Reproducibility and transparency also pose unique challenges. To ensure the credibility of LLM-generated content, explicit declarations of the model version, prompting techniques, and benchmarks against established standards are recommended. Given the 'black box' nature of LLMs, a clear reporting structure is essential to maintain transparency and validate outputs, enabling stakeholders to assess the reliability and accuracy of LLM-generated HEOR analyses. The ethical implications of using artificial intelligence (AI) in HEOR, including LLMs, are complex and multifaceted, requiring careful assessment of each use case to determine the necessary level of ethical scrutiny and transparency. Health economists must balance the potential benefits of AI adoption against the risks of maintaining current practices, while also considering issues such as accountability, bias, intellectual property, and the broader impact on the healthcare system. As LLMs and AI technologies advance, their potential role in HEOR will become increasingly evident. Key areas of promise include creating dynamic, continuously updated HEOR materials, providing patients with more accessible information, and enhancing analytics for faster access to medicines. To maximise these benefits, health economists must understand and address challenges such as data ownership and bias. The coming years will be critical for establishing best practices for GenAI in HEOR. This primer encourages health economists to adopt GenAI responsibly, balancing innovation with scientific rigor and ethical integrity to improve healthcare insights and decision-making.",Reason T; Klijn S; Rawlinson W; Benbow E; Langham J; Teitsson S; Johannesen K; Malcolm B,Estima Scientific; Bristol Myers Squibb,tim.reason@estima-sci.com.

The aim of this study was the comparison of AI models for COVID-19 diagnosis. Therefore, we: (1) trained three distinct AI models for classifying COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 pneumonia (nCP) using a large, clinically relevant CT dataset, (2) evaluated the models' performance using an independent test set, and (3) compared the models both algorithmically and experimentally.In this multicenter multi-vendor study, we collected n=1591 chest CT scans of COVID-19 (n=762) and nCP (n=829) patients from China and Germany. In Germany, the data was collected from three RACOON sites. We trained and validated three COVID-19 AI models with different architectures: COVNet based on 2D-CNN, DeCoVnet based on 3D-CNN, and AD3D-MIL based on 3D-CNN with attention module. 991 CT scans were used for training the AI models using 5-fold cross-validation. 600 CT scans from 6 different centers were used for independent testing. The models' performance was evaluated using accuracy (Acc), sensitivity (Se), and specificity (Sp).The average validation accuracy of the COVNet, DeCoVnet, and AD3D-MIL models over the 5 folds was 80.9%, 82.0%, and 84.3%, respectively. On the independent test set with n=600 CT scans, COVNet yielded Acc=76.6%, Se=67.8%, Sp=85.7%; DeCoVnet provided Acc=75.1%, Se=61.2%, Sp=89.7%; and AD3D-MIL achieved Acc=73.9%, Se=57.7%, Sp=90.8%.The classification performance of the evaluated AI models is highly dependent on the training data rather than the architecture itself.

Accurate patient assessment is essential for optimizing resource allocation and tailoring services. This retrospective study explores the application of artificial intelligence (AI) in predicting home medical care stages to enhance care delivery. Data from Taipei City Hospital (2015-2021) included inpatient, outpatient, and home medical care records. Three deep learning (DL) models-Transformer encoder-based, long short-term memory (LSTM), and gated recurrent unit (GRU)-were compared with three baseline machine learning (ML) models. Models were trained on 3, 5, and 10 consecutive visits for binary and multiclass classification. Performance was evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). The study included 4,343 patients with a mean age of 85.04 ± 11.47 years. While models trained on 10 visits generally exhibited higher performance, data from 5 visits were sufficient for accurate predictions. With five visits, the LSTM model achieved the highest AUC (0.908) for distinguishing between the absence (S0) and presence (S1-S3) of home medical care. Meanwhile, the Transformer achieved the best AUC (0.86) for classifying S0-S3, with individual stage AUCs of 0.90, 0.82, 0.81, and 0.94 for S0, S1, S2, and S3, respectively. AI deep learning models show strong potential for accurately predicting home medical care stages.

As ChatGPT becomes more popular for obtaining medical information, there are concerns regarding the accuracy and quality of its content. While prior studies in various medical specialties have yielded mixed results regarding ChatGPT's reliability, little research has focused on its ability to address questions regarding specific orthopedic procedures, such as surgical intervention for stenosing tenosynovitis (trigger finger). This study assessed the accuracy, clarity, and readability of ChatGPT's responses to ten commonly asked patient questions regarding trigger finger release. The questions were obtained from Google's ""People also ask"" section and queried in ChatGPT 4.0 on September 24, 2024. Responses were evaluated by two authors using a four-point accuracy scale. Additionally, the education level required to understand the responses was assessed using the Flesch-Kincaid scale. ChatGPT's responses achieved an average score of 1.9, falling between ""excellent, requiring no clarification"" and ""satisfactory, requiring minimal clarification."" Although the chatbot provided largely accurate information, it produced an incorrect response in one case and displayed occasional factual inaccuracies, particularly regarding treatment recommendations. The average reading level of responses was at a 12th-grade level, which exceeds the recommended 7th-8th-grade level for patient materials. ChatGPT can serve as a useful starting point for patients seeking information about orthopedic procedures like trigger finger release, but healthcare providers should guide patients in validating AI-generated content to enhance medical literacy and ensure accurate understanding.",,,dharias1@amc.edu.

This study aims to identify non-invasive biomarkers for detecting bronchogenic carcinoma and its various stages by analyzing gene expression data using bioinformatics and machine learning techniques. By leveraging these advanced computational methods, we seek to eliminate the need for surgical intervention in the diagnostic process. We utilized the TCGA-LUAD dataset, including gene expression data from healthy and cancerous samples. To identify robust biomarkers, we applied eight metaheuristic algorithms for feature selection, combined with four classification methods and two data fusion techniques to optimize performance. Our approach achieved 100% accuracy in distinguishing healthy samples from cancerous ones, outperforming existing methods that reported 97% accuracy. Notably, while prior methods have struggled to separate bronchogenic carcinoma stages effectively, our research achieved an approximate accuracy of 77% in stage classification. Furthermore, using gene enrichment methods, we identified 5, 7, and 16 diagnostic biomarker candidates for stages I, II, III, and IV, respectively. This study demonstrates that integrating bioinformatics, gene set enrichment, and biological pathway analysis can enable non-invasive diagnostics for bronchogenic carcinoma stages.

The long-term consequences of the ARB shortages and whether certain groups experienced more adverse outcomes is unknown. To evaluate changes in adherence and health outcomes after ARB recalls and to identify patients who experienced greater changes in access and adverse clinical outcomes. Using an integrated claims and electronic health record dataset and a difference-in-differences design, we evaluated changes in the proportion of days covered (PDC) for ARBs and similar drugs (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors [ACE-Is]), uncontrolled blood pressure, major cardiovascular event (MACE)-related acute care visits, and all-cause ambulatory care visits in the 12 months before vs 18 months after recalls for valsartan, losartan, and irbesartan users vs patients taking similar, nonrecalled drugs (ACE-Is, nonrecalled ARBs). Triple-difference models characterized heterogeneous associations by pre-recall patient demographic (race, ethnicity, age), clinical (baseline indication, mental health conditions), and adherence variables. Adjusting for pre-recall patient characteristics, we observed no significant changes in PDC for ARBs and ACE-Is (combined), uncontrolled blood pressure, or ambulatory care visits among 86,507 recalled ARB users vs 123,583 comparison drug users in the 18 months after the recalls. Following the recalls, medication switches increased on average by an additional 2.08 percentage points (p.p.) per quarter (95% CI = 2.01-2.15) for recalled ARB vs comparison drug users, a 195.9% relative increase. We observed the most switches in the 90-day period immediately after valsartan's recall (difference-in-difference: 9.48 p.p.; 95% CI = 9.36-9.59; relative change = 892%). Cumulatively, 55.2% of valsartan, 7.6% of losartan, and 18.9% of irbesartan users switched medications after 18 months. We observed an increase in the proportion of recalled ARB vs comparison patients who experienced medication gaps exceeding 30 days (1.13 p.p. per quarter on average; 95% CI = 0.97-1.30), which was most apparent after approximately 15 months (5 quarters). Although MACE-related acute care visits did not change in the quarter (90 days) immediately after valsartan's recall, we observed an increase of 1.40 additional visits per 1,000 recalled ARB vs comparison drug patients in each subsequent quarter, a 9.3% relative increase. Results were similar across most subgroups. The 2018 ARB recalls were associated with immediate changes in antihypertension medication use. Many patients transitioned to alternative medications. Although overall impacts on clinical outcomes were minimal and not statistically significant, small increases in medication gaps and MACE-related acute care visits among some patients occurred after more than 1 year. The ARB recalls may have been associated with fewer adverse events than other recent shortages owing to the widespread availability of alternative treatments in the same or similar drug class.",,,

40297626,TROPION-Breast05: a randomized phase III study of Dato-DXd with or without durvalumab versus chemotherapy plus pembrolizumab in patients with PD-L1-high locally recurrent inoperable or metastatic triple-negative breast cancer.,,Therapeutic advances in medical oncology,10.1177/17588359251327992,"Standard of care (SoC) for patients with advanced triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) whose tumors express PD-L1 (combined positive score ⩾ 10) is chemotherapy plus anti-PD-(L)1 inhibitors; however, prognosis and survival for most patients is poor. Datopotamab deruxtecan (Dato-DXd), a novel antibody-drug conjugate comprising a humanized anti-TROP2 IgG1 monoclonal antibody conjugated to a potent topoisomerase I inhibitor payload via a plasma-stable, cleavable, tetrapeptide-based linker, has shown preliminary activity as mono or combination therapy in advanced/metastatic TNBC. TROPION-Breast05 is an ongoing randomized, open-label, multicenter phase III study. The primary objective is to demonstrate the superiority of Dato-DXd in combination with durvalumab (an anti-PD-L1 antibody) versus SoC treatment in patients with PD-L1-high locally recurrent inoperable or metastatic TNBC. Patients (⩾18 years) will be randomized 1:1 to receive Dato-DXd (6 mg/kg intravenously (IV) every 3 weeks (Q3W)) plus durvalumab (1120 mg IV Q3W) or investigator's choice of chemotherapy (ICC; paclitaxel, nab-paclitaxel, or gemcitabine plus carboplatin) plus pembrolizumab (200 mg IV Q3W). In selected countries, patients will also be randomized (1:1:1) to a third arm of Dato-DXd monotherapy. The primary study endpoint is progression-free survival (PFS) per blinded independent central review (Dato-DXd plus durvalumab arm vs ICC plus pembrolizumab arm). Overall survival is a key secondary endpoint; other secondary endpoints include PFS (investigator-assessed), objective response rate, duration of response, clinical benefit rate at Week 24 (all assessed in the Dato-DXd plus durvalumab arm vs ICC plus pembrolizumab arm), patient-reported outcomes, and safety. The study is approved by independent ethics committees or institutional review boards at each study site. All patients will provide written informed consent. TROPION-Breast05 will assess the potential role of Dato-DXd with or without durvalumab in patients with PD-L1-high advanced or metastatic TNBC. The findings of this trial could lead to a new treatment option for these patients. ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT06103864 (Date of registration: 27 October 2023). TROPION-Breast05: A clinical study comparing datopotamab deruxtecan (Dato-DXd), alone or in combination with durvalumab, versus standard-of-care treatment in people with triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) with cancer cells that express PD-L1 and whose cancer cannot be removed by surgery or has spread to other parts of the body. Standard treatment for people with TNBC that cannot be removed with surgery or has spread to other parts of the body and whose cancer cells express a protein called PD-L1 is chemotherapy plus anti-PD-(L)1 inhibitors. However, additional treatment options are needed to improve treatment outcomes and minimize side effects. Dato-DXd, an antibody-drug conjugate (ADC), consists of an antibody (datopotamab) linked to an anti-cancer drug (deruxtecan). The antibody attaches to a protein found on the surface of breast cancer cells called TROP2. The antibody is then taken inside the cancer cells, the anti-cancer drug is released, and the cells are killed. By releasing the anti-cancer drug inside the cell, the treatment is directed to the cancer site with the goal of minimizing side effects. In a study called TROPION-PanTumor01, 40% of people with TNBC who received Dato-DXd (and who had not previously received ADCs) had a reduction in their tumor size of at least 30%. These results were promising and it is thought that combining Dato-DXd with a PD-L1 inhibitor may make cancer cells more susceptible to being targeted by the body’s immune system. In another study called BEGONIA, Dato-DXd was evaluated in combination with durvalumab, which blocks the PD-1/PD-L1 interaction. In people with TNBC, treatment with Dato-DXd and durvalumab resulted in a decrease in tumor size of at least 30% in 79% of people. The safety profile of Dato-DXd and durvalumab was tolerable and manageable; the most common D-DXd side effects were nausea and mouth sores, known as stomatitis. Based on data from TROPION-PanTumor01 and BEGONIA, the phase III TROPION-Breast05 will compare Dato-DXd alone and in combination with durvalumab vs standard-of-care treatment for people with TNBC whose cancer cells express PD-L1, and whose cancer cannot be removed by surgery, or their cancer has spread to other parts of the body.",Cristofanilli M; Loi S; Cescon DW; Hovey T; Nawrot A; Tse K; Vukovic P,Department of Medicine; Department of Medical Oncology; Oncology R&D; Division of Cancer Research; Biostatistics,
40297592,Long-Term Outcomes of Minimally Invasive vs. Traditional Open Spinal Fusion: A Comparative Analysis.,,Journal of spine research and surgery,,"Spinal fusion is a widely performed surgical intervention for managing degenerative spinal conditions, instability, and deformities. Traditionally, open spinal fusion has been the standard approach, offering direct visualization and access to spinal structures. However, advancements in surgical techniques have led to the development of minimally invasive spinal fusion (MISF) as an alternative, aiming to achieve comparable clinical outcomes while reducing surgical trauma, postoperative pain, and recovery time. Despite these advantages, concerns remain regarding the long-term effectiveness of MISF, particularly in terms of fusion rates, complication risks, and adjacent segment disease (ASD). This review critically examines the long-term outcomes of MISF compared to traditional open fusion, focusing on key factors such as perioperative outcomes, pain relief, functional recovery, fusion success rates, and cost-effectiveness. Perioperative data indicate that MISF is associated with reduced blood loss, shorter hospital stays, and lower infection rates but may involve longer surgical times and a steeper learning curve. Long-term clinical outcomes appear comparable between MISF and open fusion, with both techniques achieving high fusion rates and significant improvements in pain and function. However, the impact of MISF on adjacent segment disease remains inconclusive, with conflicting evidence regarding its potential biomechanical advantages. Cost-effectiveness analyses suggest that MISF may offer financial advantages in the long term by reducing hospitalization and rehabilitation expenses, despite higher initial surgical costs. Nonetheless, limitations in current research, including variability in study methodologies, patient selection, and surgeon expertise, necessitate further high-quality, long-term randomized controlled trials. This review synthesizes the current literature on MISF and traditional open fusion, identifies existing research gaps, and outlines future directions for optimizing surgical decision-making and improving patient outcomes.",,,

However, trial protocols vary in their completeness and often do not address key elements of design and conduct. The SPIRIT (Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Interventional Trials) statement was first published in 2013 as guidance to improve the completeness of trial protocols. Periodic updates incorporating the latest evidence and best practices are needed to ensure that the guidance remains relevant to users. Here, we aimed to systematically update the SPIRIT recommendations for minimum items to address in the protocol of a randomized trial. We completed a scoping review and developed a project-specific database of empirical and theoretical evidence to generate a list of potential changes to the SPIRIT 2013 checklist. The list was enriched with recommendations provided by lead authors of existing SPIRIT/CONSORT (Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials) extensions (Harms, Outcomes, Non-pharmacological Treatment) and other reporting guidelines (TIDieR). The potential modifications were rated in a three-round Delphi survey followed by a consensus meeting. Overall, 317 individuals participated in the Delphi consensus process and 30 experts attended the consensus meeting. The process led to the addition of two new protocol items, revision to five items, deletion/merger of five items, and integration of key items from other relevant reporting guidelines. Notable changes include a new open science section, additional emphasis on the assessment of harms and description of interventions and comparators, and a new item on how patients and the public will be involved in trial design, conduct and reporting. The updated SPIRIT 2025 statement consists of an evidence-based checklist of 34 minimum items to address in a trial protocol, along with a diagram illustrating the schedule of enrollment, interventions and assessments for trial participants. To facilitate implementation, we also developed an expanded version of the SPIRIT 2025 checklist and an accompanying explanation and elaboration document.

While AI technologies promise significant benefits-such as improved diagnostic accuracy, shorter waiting times, reduced reliance on radiographers, and overall productivity gains and cost-effectiveness-current interventions disproportionately favour those already engaged in screening. This neglect of non-attenders, who face the worst cancer outcomes, exacerbates existing health disparities and undermines the core objectives of screening programmes.Using breast cancer screening as a case study, we argue that AI interventions must not only improve health outcomes and demonstrate cost-effectiveness but also address inequities by prioritising non-attenders. To this end, we advocate for the design and implementation of cost-saving AI interventions. Such interventions could enable reinvestment into strategies specifically aimed at increasing engagement among non-attenders, thereby reducing disparities in cancer outcomes. Decision modelling is presented as a practical method to identify and evaluate these cost-saving interventions. Furthermore, the paper calls for greater transparency in decision-making, urging policymakers to explicitly account for the equity implications and opportunity costs associated with AI investments. Only then will they be able to balance the promise of technological innovation with the ethical imperative to improve health outcomes for all, particularly underserved populations. Methods such as distributional cost-effectiveness analysis are recommended to quantify and address disparities, ensuring more equitable healthcare delivery.",,,harry.hill@sheffield.ac.uk.
40294631,Special Issue on CDS Failures: A Rash Decision: Implementing an EHR-Integrated Penicillin Allergy Delabeling Protocol Without Adequate Clinician Support.,,Applied clinical informatics,10.1055/a-2595-4849,"Approximately 10% of patients have a documented penicillin ""allergy""; however, up to 95% have subsequent negative testing. These patients may receive suboptimal antibiotics, leading to longer hospitalizations and higher costs, rates of resistant and nosocomial infections, and all-cause mortality. To mitigate these risks in children, we implemented an inpatient penicillin allergy delabeling protocol and integrated into the electronic health record (EHR) through a mixed methods approach of clinical decision support (CDS). We describe our protocol implementation across three sequential phases: ""Pilot"", ""Active Antimicrobial Stewardship Program (ASP)"", and ""Mixed CDS"". We highlight several potential pitfalls that may have contributed to poor clinician adoption. Patients were risk-stratified as non-allergic, low-risk, or high-risk based on history. Process measures included: evaluation rate, oral challenge rate for low-risk, and allergy referral rate for high-risk or low-risk when oral challenge was deferred. Primary outcome measure was penicillin allergy delabeling rate among low-risk or non-allergic. Balancing measures included rate of epinephrine or antihistamine administrations. The Pilot and ASP Phases used clinician education and an order set, but were mostly manual processes. The Mixed CDS Phase introduced interruptive alerts, dynamic text in note templates, and patient list columns to guide clinicians, but little education was provided. The Mixed CDS Phase had the lowest evaluation rate compared to the Pilot and Active ASP Phases (6.4% vs 25% vs 15%). However, when evaluation was performed, the Mixed CDS Phase had the highest oral challenge rate (33% vs 26% vs 13%) and delabeling rate (43% vs 33% vs 27%). No adverse events occurred. CDS tools improve clinician decision-making and optimize patient care. However, relying on CDS for complex clinical evaluations can lead to failure when clinicians cannot find the tool or appreciate the importance. Person-to-person communication can be vital in establishing a process and educating intended users for successful CDS implementat.",Hampton NB,Business Intelligence Data Solutions,

40294407,AI in Home Care-Evaluation of Large Language Models for Future Training of Informal Caregivers: Observational Comparative Case Study.,2025-04-29,Journal of medical Internet research,10.2196/70703,"The aging population presents an accomplishment for society but also poses significant challenges for governments, health care systems, and caregivers. Elevated rates of functional limitations among older adults, primarily caused by chronic conditions, necessitate adequate and safe care, including in-home settings. Traditionally, informal caregiver training has relied on verbal and written instructions. However, the advent of digital resources has introduced videos and interactive platforms, offering more accessible and effective training. Large language models (LLMs) have emerged as potential tools for personalized information delivery. While LLMs exhibit the capacity to mimic clinical reasoning and support decision-making, their potential to serve as alternatives to evidence-based professional instruction remains unexplored. We aimed to evaluate the appropriateness of home care instructions generated by LLMs (including GPTs) in comparison to a professional gold standard. Furthermore, it seeks to identify specific domains where LLMs show the most promise and where improvements are necessary to optimize their reliability for caregiver training. An observational, comparative case study evaluated 3 LLMs-GPT-3.5, GPT-4o, and Microsoft Copilot-in 10 home care scenarios. A rubric assessed the models against a reference standard (gold standard) created by health care professionals. Independent reviewers evaluated variables including specificity, clarity, and self-efficacy. In addition to comparing each LLM to the gold standard, the models were also compared against each other across all study domains to identify relative strengths and weaknesses. Statistical analyses compared LLMs performance to the gold standard to ensure consistency and validity, as well as to analyze differences between LLMs across all evaluated domains. The study revealed that while no LLM achieved the precision of the professional gold standard, GPT-4o outperformed GPT-3.5, and Copilot in specificity (4.6 vs 3.7 and 3.6), clarity (4.8 vs 4.1 and 3.9), and self-efficacy (4.6 vs 3.8 and 3.4). However, the models exhibited significant limitations, with GPT-4o and Copilot omitting relevant details in 60% (6/10) of the cases, and GPT-3.5 doing so in 80% (8/10). When compared to the gold standard, only 10% (2/20) of GPT-4o responses were rated as equally specific, 20% (4/20) included comparable practical advice, and just 5% (1/20) provided a justification as detailed as professional guidance. Furthermore, error frequency did not differ significantly across models (P=.65), though Copilot had the highest rate of incorrect information (20%, 2/10 vs 10%, 1/10 for GPT-4o and 0%, 0/0 for GPT-3.5). LLMs, particularly GPT-4o subscription-based, show potential as tools for training informal caregivers by providing tailored guidance and reducing errors. Although not yet surpassing professional instruction quality, these models offer a flexible and accessible alternative that could enhance home safety and care quality. Further research is necessary to address limitations and optimize their performance. Future implementation of LLMs may alleviate health care system burdens by reducing common caregiver errors.",Matarredona V,Fundación para el Fomento de la Investigación Sanitaria y Biomédica de la Comunitat Valenciana,

Doctors often lack access to continuous behavioral data, making it difficult to detect deviations from normal patterns when elderly patients arrive for a consultation. Without historical insights into common behaviors and potential anomalies detected with unobtrusive techniques (e.g., non-wearable devices), timely and informed medical interventions become challenging. To address this, we propose an edge-based Internet of Things (IoT) framework that enables real-time monitoring and anomaly detection using non-wearable sensors to assist doctors and caregivers in assessing the health of elderly patients. By processing data locally, the system minimizes privacy concerns and ensures immediate data availability, allowing healthcare professionals to detect unusual behavioral patterns early. The system employs advanced machine learning (ML) models to identify deviations that may indicate potential health risks. A prototype of our system has been developed to test its feasibility and demonstrate, through the application of two of the most frequently used ML models, i.e., isolation forest and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, that it can provide scalability, efficiency, and reliability in the context of elderly care. Further, the provided dashboard enables caregivers and healthcare professionals to access real-time alerts and longitudinal trends, facilitating proactive interventions.

We evaluated VT in the Caribbean, Central and South America network for HIV epidemiology to further study the benefit of ART on VT in our region. We retrospectively collected data on cis-gender women ≥15 years of age enrolled in HIV clinics in Brazil, Chile, Honduras and Peru from 2003 to 2018 with ≥1 pregnancy resulting in a live birth after clinic entry to examine the association of ART use at the time of delivery and VT. We used propensity-score-matched logistic regression to examine the odds of VT by ART use. Matching weights incorporated site, HIV RNA, CD4 cell count, maternal age, year and HIV diagnosis before or during pregnancy. We also examined the proportion of women who received ART during pregnancy before and after the treat-all era, as defined within each country. A total of 623 pregnant women with HIV contributed 727 live births. Of all births, 613 (84.3%) infants had known HIV status and there were 22 (3.6%) VT events. Four of the 22 (18%) were born to women on ART at delivery, compared to 403 of 591 (68%) infants negative for HIV. In the propensity-score-matched model, ART use at delivery was associated with 85% decreased odds of VT (odds ratio = 0.15, 95% confidence interval 0.04-0.58).

40291294,Effects of Introducing Generative AI in Rehabilitation Clinical Documentation.,,Cureus,10.7759/cureus.81313,"Introduction Healthcare professionals reportedly spend a significant proportion of their working hours on documentation. Therefore, we developed a generative AI solution specialized in creating clinical documentation for rehabilitation. This study aimed to examine the impact of generative AI on clinical documentation tasks. Methods Twelve rehabilitation professionals (physical therapists, occupational therapists, and speech-language pathologists) participated in this study. We compared conventional clinical documentation (Period A) with clinical documentation using a generative AI system (Period B). Measures taken for both periods included time required to complete the clinical documentation (documentation time), workload assessed using the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Task Load Index (NASA-TLX), and quality of the clinical documentation. Between-group comparisons of these measurements were performed. Additionally, we recorded the number of non-conversational voice memos (voice data inputs) in Period B. After the study, we assessed the participants' willingness to adopt generative AI (implementation intent) on a five-point scale. For statistical analysis, we compared documentation time, NASA-TLX scores, and documentation quality between the two periods. Time saved was determined by subtracting the documentation time of Period B from that of Period A, and a correlation analysis between the number of voice memos (voice data input) and the willingness to adopt the technology was conducted. Analyses were performed using R version 4.2.3 (R Core Team, Durham, NC), with the level of significance set at 0.05. Results No significant difference was observed in the time required to prepare clinical documentation between Periods A and B. However, in Period B, the NASA-TLX time pressure score was significantly lower, while the quality of clinical documentation was significantly higher. Additionally, a strong positive correlation was observed between the reduction in documentation time and the number of voice memos (r = 0.71, p < 0.01), as well as a significant positive correlation with the willingness to adopt the system (r = 0.67, p < 0.05) during clinical documentation in Period B. Conclusion Our findings indicate that using generative AI for clinical documentation tasks can reduce time pressure and improve documentation quality. Moreover, the reduction in documentation time was associated with the frequency of voice memos and the degree of participants' willingness to adopt the system. These results suggest that, to achieve further reductions in workload and costs, considering the motivation and cooperative framework of healthcare professionals when introducing generative AI solutions is essential.",,,

While Common Data Models (CDMs) facilitate interoperability, they often cause information loss, exhibit semantic inconsistencies, and are labor-intensive to implement and update. We explore how generative artificial intelligence (GenAI), especially large language models (LLMs), could make CDMs obsolete in quantitative healthcare data analysis by interpreting natural language queries and generating code, enabling direct interaction with raw data. Knowledge graphs (KGs) standardize relationships and semantics across heterogeneous data, preserving integrity. This perspective review proposes a fourth generation of distributed data network analysis, building on previous generations categorized by their approach to data standardization and utilization. It emphasizes the potential of GenAI to overcome the limitations CDMs with GenAI-enabled access, KGs, and automatic code generation. A data commons may further enhance this capability, and KGs may well be needed to enable effective GenAI. Addressing privacy, security, and governance is critical; any new method must ensure protections comparable to CDM-based models. Our approach would aim to enable efficient, real-time analyses across diverse datasets and enhance patient safety. We recommend prioritizing research to assess how GenAI can transform quantitative healthcare data analysis by overcoming current limitations. Perspective Review: Will generative AI make common data models obsolete in future analyses of distributed data networks? This perspective review explores whether Artificial Intelligence (AI) can revolutionize healthcare data analysis by reducing the current reliance on Common Data Models (CDMs), which encompass the following elements: • CDMs are approaches that standardize diverse healthcare to a single shared format to enable efficiencies in data management and analyses using the same analysis syntax and analytic tools. • Although CDMs have strengths, they also have limitations, such as high costs, potential loss of important details, significant effort to produce and maintain, and delays in data availability due to lengthy data processing steps. • With the rapid growth of healthcare data, effectively analyzing it is crucial for patient safety and public health. • AI may offer an alternative solution by analyzing data directly in its original form, reducing costs, preserving data details, and enabling real-time insights that support better patient outcomes and safer medication use. This review investigates challenges currently associated with CDMs and explores how AI, particularly generative AI, can directly analyze raw data without the need for standardization. We discuss the following: • How AI can interpret complex questions and generate accurate answers from raw data, enabling more timely analyses of real-world data. • While CDMs may still be necessary in the short term, AI has the potential to eventually replace them, improving patient care and safety outcomes by providing faster and more precise insights. • This perspective could lead to new methods of using healthcare data to inform decision-making and enhance treatment outcomes. • By adopting advanced AI technologies, healthcare providers and researchers can better understand treatment risks and benefits, make more informed decisions, and ultimately improve patient safety and public health.",Painter JL; Ramcharran D; Bate A,GSK,

However, non-adherent behavior is estimated to affect up to 50 % of patients with chronic conditions, leading to poorer health outcomes among patients, higher rates of hospitalization, and increased mortality. This study offers a provision of a structured overview of the computational methods and techniques used to build predictive models of treatment adherence of patients. A scoping review was conducted, and the following databases were searched to identify relevant publications: PubMed, IEEE and Web of Science. The screening of publications consisted of two steps. First, the hits obtained from the search were independently screened and selected using an open-source machine learning (ML)-aided pipeline applying active learning: ASReview, Active learning for Systematic Reviews. Publications selected for full-text review and data extraction were those highly prioritized by ASReview. A total of 45 papers were selected into the second round of full-text screening and 29 papers were considered in the final review. The findings suggest supervised learning (regression and classification) to be the most used analytical approach, being the generalized linear models (GEE) (21.67 %), logistic regressions (20 %) and random forest (18.33 %) the most frequently employed techniques. The family of GEE identified in the studies included some multiple, hierarchical or mixed-effect models, among other. The selection of these models often depended on data source and types (e.g., logistic regressions for dichotomous outcome measures). Furthermore, over 54 % of adherence topics being related to chronic metabolic conditions such as diabetes, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. Most assessed predictors were both treatment and socio-demographic and economic-related factors followed by condition-related factors. The adherence to treatment variable was mostly dichotomous (12 out of 29) and computed using metrics as the Medical Possession Ratio with a 80 % threshold. A limitation of the reviewed studies is the lack of accountancy for interrelationships between different determinants of adherence behavior, denoting the need for future research regarding the use of more complex analytical techniques that better capture these connections (e.g., patient's socio-economic status and the ability to afford medication). The creation of systems to accurately predict treatment adherence can pave the way for improved therapeutic outcomes, reduced healthcare costs and enabling personalized treatment plans.

Aficamten is a selective cardiac myosin inhibitor that reduces hypercontractility directly by reducing myosin-actin interaction. This study aims to investigate the safety and efficacy of concomitant use and withdrawal of disopyramide in patients with symptomatic oHCM receiving aficamten. Patients with oHCM enrolled in REDWOOD-HCM Cohort 3 (open-label), SEQUOIA-HCM (placebo-controlled), and FOREST-HCM (open-label) were analyzed. The authors identified 4 groups, each with patients symptomatic despite background therapy with disopyramide who received: 1) disopyramide plus aficamten and subsequent aficamten withdrawal per protocol (Diso-Afi Withdrawal); 2) disopyramide plus placebo (Diso-Pbo); 3) aficamten plus disopyramide with subsequent disopyramide withdrawal (Afi-Diso Withdrawal); and 4) continued both disopyramide and aficamten (Diso+Afi Continuous). Assessments were performed at baseline, after aficamten or placebo add-on therapy, and after washout (except at week 24 for Diso+Afi Continuous group). Overall, 50 unique patients from 3 trials enrolled, resulting in 93 subjects (segments) across 4 groups: Diso-Afi Withdrawal (n = 29), Diso-Pbo (n = 20), Afi-Diso Withdrawal (n = 17), and Diso+Afi Continuous (n = 27); mean disopyramide dose was 331 ± 146 mg/d. The addition of aficamten to disopyramide alleviated left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) obstruction (resting: change [Δ] in least squares mean -27.0 ± 3.6, Valsalva: Δ least squares mean -39.2 ± 5.0, both P < 0.0001), symptoms (≥1 NYHA functional class improvement: 77.8% [95% CI: 61.0-94.5]; P < 0.0001; Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire-Clinical Summary Score: 12.3 ± 3.3 [P < 0.001]), and reduced N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide ratio: 0.35 [95% CI: 0.26-0.48]; P < 0.0001, and there was no significant change with placebo. Withdrawal of aficamten while on disopyramide resulted in return of LVOT obstruction, worsening of symptoms, and increase in NT-proBNP to baseline values. Conversely, withdrawal of disopyramide while on aficamten did not impact efficacy. There were no safety events associated with aficamten or disopyramide withdrawal, and no episodes of atrial fibrillation after disopyramide withdrawal. In this cohort of patients with symptomatic oHCM with persistent LVOT obstruction, combination therapy with aficamten and disopyramide was safe and well tolerated but did not enhance clinical efficacy vs aficamten alone. For such oHCM patients, aficamten treatment may be considered with an option to discontinue disopyramide.

40285226,Development of a Deep-Learning-Based Computerized Scoring Algorithm.,2025-04-26,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",10.3390/s25082537,"During polygraph tests, the examiner evaluates physiological responses recorded on a chart to identify deception. Generally, this evaluation involves a numerical scoring system. However, biases related to politics, region, and religion, as well as personal factors such as fatigue and stress, can lead to inaccuracies in the examiner's judgment. To solve these problems, computerized scoring systems (CSSs) that automatically analyze charts have been introduced, aiming to reduce human error. Conventional CSS models, which rely on linear classifiers, struggle with the nonlinear nature of biological signals, resulting in poor performance. Therefore, it is crucial to incorporate deep learning structures such as deep neural networks, which account for the nonlinearity of bio-signals, to enhance effectiveness of CSSs. This paper introduces a Korean computerized scoring system that leverages a deep neural network, which was developed to mitigate the subjective bias of polygraph examiners and to obtain high-accuracy results by considering the nonlinearity of bio-signals. The performance of the developed algorithm was evaluated, demonstrating recall, precision, and F1 scores of 0.9681 ± 0.0314, 0.9700 ± 0.0321, and 0.9683 ± 0.0171, respectively.

However, their ""black-box"" nature raises concerns about trust and transparency, particularly in high-stakes fields such as healthcare and autonomous systems. While explainable AI (XAI) methods attempt to address these concerns through feature- or concept-based explanations, existing approaches are often limited by the need for manually defined concepts, overly abstract granularity, or misalignment with human semantics. This paper introduces the Enhanced Bottleneck Concept Learner (E-BotCL), a self-supervised framework that autonomously discovers task-relevant, interpretable semantic concepts via a dual-path contrastive learning strategy and multi-task regularization. By combining contrastive learning to build robust concept prototypes, attention mechanisms for spatial localization, and feature aggregation to activate concepts, E-BotCL enables end-to-end concept learning and classification without requiring human supervision. Experiments conducted on the CUB200 and ImageNet datasets demonstrated that E-BotCL significantly enhanced interpretability while maintaining classification accuracy. Specifically, two interpretability metrics, the Concept Discovery Rate (CDR) and Concept Consistency (CC), improved by 0.6104 and 0.4486, respectively.

Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) accounts for most cases of adult leukemia, and our goal is to screen out some AML from adults. In this work, we introduce an AI-enhanced system designed to facilitate early screening and diagnosis of AML among adults. Our approach combines the infrared absorption spectra of serum measured with attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR), which identifies distinctive molecular signatures in lyophilized serum, together with standard clinical blood biochemical test results. We developed a multi-modality spectral transformer network (MSTNetwork) to generate latent space feature vectors from these datasets. Subsequently, these vectors were assessed using a linear discriminant analysis (LDA) algorithm to estimate the likelihood of acute myeloid leukemia. By analyzing blood samples from leukemia patients and the negative control (including non-leukemia patients and healthy individuals), we achieved rapid and accurate prediction and identification of acute myeloid leukemia among adults. Compared to conventional methods relying solely on either FTIR spectra or biochemical indicators of blood, our multi-modality classification system demonstrated higher accuracy and sensitivity, ultimately achieving an accuracy of 98% and a sensitivity of 98%, improving the sensitivity by 12% (compared with using only biochemical indicators) or over 6% (compared with using only FTIR spectra).

Particularly, during the nighttime and on weekends, provider staffing is often limited, which may make it difficult for pregnant persons to receive quality care. We leveraged existing data collected in a pharmacovigilance pregnancy project, named Measuring Adverse Pregnancy and Newborn Congenital Outcomes (MANGO) study, to determine any associations between nighttime/weekend deliveries and adverse (1) maternal, (2) birth, or (3) neonatal outcomes. We conducted a secondary analysis of prospective data from the MANGO study, which documents delivery outcomes for pregnant persons at the Moi Teaching and Referral Hospital in western Kenya, from September 2020-November 2023. We utilized multivariable Poisson regression models, with log link, robust standard errors, and adjusted for several covariates, to assess the association between nighttime/weekend deliveries and adverse composite maternal, birth, or neonatal outcomes. A total of 25,911 neonates born to 25,247 pregnant persons were included. More than half of deliveries occurred during nighttime (6pm to 7am)/weekends (62.6%). In multivariate modeling, nighttime/weekend delivery was associated with a reduced risk of adverse composite maternal outcomes (adjusted risk ratio [aRR] 0.92, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.88, 0.96) and composite birth outcomes (aRR 0.92, 95% CI: 0.88, 0.96). No association was found between nighttime/weekend delivery and neonatal death. In post-hoc analyses, weekend deliveries were associated with reduced risk of emergency Caesarean deliveries, preterm birth, and low birth weight. Having advanced maternal age, obstetric complications, and transferring to the hospital for delivery were associated with adverse maternal and birth outcomes. Poor APGAR score was strongly associated with neonatal death. Nighttime/weekend deliveries were associated with better maternal and birth outcomes, perhaps due to decreased emergency Caesarean deliveries for high-risk pregnancies or other factors. Greater attention to individual-level factors, such as obstetric complications, may be considered to improve outcomes for pregnant persons and their neonates.

The CNN model achieved a 91.6 % accuracy in classifying HF severity into NYHA I-II (asymptomatic to mild HF) and NYHA III-IV grades (moderate to severe HF) categories. Furthermore, the model generated a novel HF-index as a real-time indicator of HF severity, which showed a positive correlation (R = 0.74) with plasma B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels, thereby validating its effectiveness in reflecting HF severity. We successfully constructed a novel at-home HF monitoring system utilizing a portable single‑lead ECG device. This system has been validated for its effectiveness in at-home HF monitoring, representing a significant advancement in remote healthcare for HF management.",,,ehasumi-circ@umin.ac.jp.
40280538,Advances and therapeutic opportunities in visual cycle modulation.,,Progress in retinal and eye research,10.1016/j.preteyeres.2025.101360,"The visual cycle is a metabolic pathway that enables continuous vision by regenerating the 11-cis-retinal chromophore for photoreceptors opsins. Although integral to normal visual function, the flux of retinoids through this cycle can contribute to a range of retinal pathologies, including Stargardt disease, age-related macular degeneration, and diabetic retinopathy. In such conditions, intermediates and byproducts of the visual cycle, such as bisretinoid components of lipofuscin, can accumulate, concomitant with cellular damage and eventual photoreceptor loss. This has inspired efforts to modulate the visual cycle, aiming to slow or prevent the formation of these toxic intermediates and thus preserve retinal structure and function. Over the past two decades, multiple strategies to modulate the visual cycle have emerged. These include both intrinsic approaches, targeting key enzymes, retinoid-binding proteins, or receptors within the pigment epithelium or photoreceptors (e.g., RPE65, CRBP1, and rhodopsin inhibitors/antagonists) and extrinsic strategies that indirectly alter retinoid availability within the retina (e.g., RBP4 antagonists). Many of these agents have shown promise in animal models of visual cycle-associated retinal diseases, reducing pathological changes, and improving retinal survival. Several have advanced into clinical studies, although none are currently FDA-approved. Challenges remain in optimizing drug specificity and duration of action while minimizing side effects such as nyctalopia. In this review, we comprehensively examine current and emerging visual cycle modulators, discuss their medicinal chemistry, mechanisms of action, efficacy in preclinical and clinical studies, and highlight future opportunities for drug discovery aimed at safely and effectively preserving vision through modulation of this biochemical pathway.",,,pkiser@uci.edu.

40279575,Expert and Interdisciplinary Analysis of AI-Driven Chatbots for Mental Health Support: Mixed Methods Study.,2025-04-26,Journal of medical Internet research,10.2196/67114,"Recent years have seen an immense surge in the creation and use of chatbots as social and mental health companions. Aiming to provide empathic responses in support of the delivery of personalized support, these tools are often presented as offering immense potential. However, it is also essential that we understand the risks of their deployment, including their potential adverse impacts on the mental health of users, including those most at risk. The study aims to assess the ethical and pragmatic clinical implications of using chatbots that claim to aid mental health. While several studies within human-computer interaction and related fields have examined users' perceptions of such systems, few studies have engaged mental health professionals in critical analysis of their conduct as mental health support tools. This paper comprises, in turn, an effort to assess the ethical and pragmatic clinical implications of using chatbots that claim to aid mental health. This study included 8 interdisciplinary mental health professional participants (from psychology and psychotherapy to social care and crisis volunteer workers) in a mixed methods and hands-on analysis of 2 popular mental health-related chatbots' data handling, interface design, and responses. This analysis was carried out through profession-specific tasks with each chatbot, eliciting participants' perceptions through both the Trust in Automation scale and semistructured interviews. Through thematic analysis and a 2-tailed, paired t test, these chatbots' implications for mental health support were thus evaluated. Qualitative analysis revealed emphatic initial impressions among mental health professionals of chatbot responses likely to produce harm, exhibiting a generic mode of care, and risking user dependence and manipulation given the central role of trust in the therapeutic relationship. Trust scores from the Trust in Automation scale, while exhibiting no statistically significant differences between the chatbots (t Through this work, we contributed insights into the mental health professional perspective on the design of chatbots used for mental health and underscore the necessity of ongoing critical assessment and iterative refinement to maximize the benefits and minimize the risks associated with integrating AI into mental health support.",,,

In the CAR, factors like poverty, limited healthcare access, high HIV prevalence, malnutrition, inadequate sanitation, low measles vaccination coverage, and conflict-driven crowded living conditions elevate TB risk. Improved AI-driven surveillance is hypothesized to address under-reporting and underdiagnosis. Therefore, we created an epidemiological digital representation of TB in Bangui by employing passive data collection, spatial analysis using a 100 × 100 m grid, and mapping TB treatment services. Our approach included estimating undiagnosed TB cases through the integration of TB incidence, notification rates, and diagnostic data. High-resolution predictions are achieved by subdividing the area into smaller units while considering influencing variables within the Bayesian model. By designating moderate and high-risk hotspots, the model highlighted the potential for precise resource allocation in TB control. The strength of our model lies in its adaptability to overcome challenges, although this may have been to the detriment of precision in some areas.

Although the presence of many arthropod vectors has been documented, the collective burden of arbovirus infections and baseline pre-existing immunity remains enigmatic. Our goal was to determine the seroprevalence of arbovirus exposure across the country using a resource-sparing, multiplex immunoassay to determine IgG responses to immunodominant antigens. 532 human serum samples, from healthy adults, collected from 10 counties across Liberia, were measured for IgG reactivity against antigens of eight common flavi-, alpha-, and orthobunya/nairoviruses suspected to be present in West Africa. Approximately 32.5% of our samples were reactive to alphavirus (CHIKV) E2, ~7% were reactive separately to West Nile (WNV) and Zika virus (ZIKV) NS1, while 4.3 and 3.2% were reactive to Rift Valley Fever virus (RVFV) N and Dengue virus-2 (DENV-2) NS1, respectively. Altogether, 21.6% of our samples were reactive to ≥1 flavivirus NS1s. Of the CHIKV E2 reactive samples, 8.5% were also reactive to at least one flavivirus NS1, and six samples were concurrently reactive to antigens of all three arbovirus groups, suggesting a high burden of multiple arbovirus infections for some participants. These insights suggest the presence of these four arbovirus families in Liberia with low and moderate rates of flavi- and alphavirus infections, respectively, in healthy adults. Further confirmational investigation, such as mosquito surveillance or other serological tests, is warranted and should be conducted before initiating additional flavivirus vaccination campaigns. The findings of these studies can help guide healthcare resource mobilization, vector control, and animal husbandry practices.",,,
