40390150,Enhancing infectious intestinal disease diagnosis through metagenomic and metatranscriptomic sequencing of 1000 human diarrhoeal samples.,,Genome medicine,10.1186/s13073-025-01478-w,"Current surveillance of diarrhoeal disease is hindered by limitations of traditional diagnostic approaches, which often fail to identify the causative organism, particularly for novel or hard-to-culture bacterial pathogens. Sequencing nucleic acids directly from stool can overcome such constraints, but such approaches need to reliably detect pathogens identifiable by conventional methods. As part of the INTEGRATE study, we analysed stool microbiomes from 1067 patients with gastroenteritis symptoms using direct sequencing, and compared findings with standard diagnostic techniques (culture, immunoassay, microscopy, and single-target PCR) and molecular assays (Luminex xTAG GPP) for detection of bacterial and viral pathogens in the UK. We found strong positive correlations between metatranscriptomic reads and traditional diagnostics for six out of 15 pathogens. The metatranscriptomic data were highly correlated with the Luminex assay for eight out of 14 pathogens. In contrast, metagenomic sequencing only showed a strong positive correlation with traditional diagnostics for three of 15 pathogens, and with Luminex for four of 14 pathogens. Compared with metagenomics, metatranscriptomics had increased sensitivity of detection for four pathogens, while metagenomics was more effective for detecting five pathogens. Metatranscriptomics gave near-complete transcriptome coverage for Human mastadenovirus F and detected Cryptosporidium via identification of Cryptosporidium parvum virus (CSpV1). A comprehensive transcriptomic profile of Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis was recovered from the stool of a patient with a laboratory-confirmed Salmonella infection. Furthermore, comparison of RNA/DNA ratios between pathogen-positive and pathogen-negative samples demonstrated that metatranscriptomics can distinguish pathogen-positive/negative samples and provide insights into pathogen biology. Higher RNA/DNA ratios were observed in samples that tested positive via gold-standard diagnostics. This study highlights the power of directly sequencing nucleic acids from human samples to augment gastrointestinal pathogen surveillance and clinical diagnostics. Metatranscriptomics was most effective for identifying a wide range of pathogens and showed superior sensitivity. We propose that metatranscriptomics should be considered for future diagnosis and surveillance of gastrointestinal pathogens. We assembled a rich data resource of paired metagenomic and metatranscriptomic datasets, direct from patient stool samples, and have made these data publicly available to enhance the understanding of pathogens associated with infectious intestinal diseases.",Cunliffe NA; ,; NIHR Health Protection Research Unit in Gastrointestinal Infections,Alistair.Darby@liverpool.ac.uk.

In our preliminary investigations, we identified the E. maxima surface antigen (EmSAG) as an inhibitory molecule of IFN-γ. EmSAG was screened and characterised from an E. maxima sporozoite cDNA expression library. The present study aimed to evaluate the immunomodulatory effects of EmSAG on chicken peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and various T cell subsets. We analysed cell proliferation, nitric oxide (NO) release, and cytokine transcription. The results revealed that EmSAG boosts PBMC proliferation and promotes differentiation of CD4",,,songxiaokai@njau.edu.cn.
40390100,Nose-to-brain drug delivery: from bench to bedside.,,Translational neurodegeneration,10.1186/s40035-025-00481-w,"There is increasing interest in nose-to-brain delivery as an innovative drug delivery strategy for neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson's or Alzheimer's disease. The unique anatomy of the nose-brain interface facilitates direct drug transport via the olfactory and trigeminal pathways to the brain, bypassing the blood-brain barrier. Different administration techniques as well as advanced drug formulations like targeted nanoparticles and thermoresponsive systems have been explored to improve the delivery efficiency and the therapeutic efficacy. This review provides an up-to-date perspective on this fast-developing field, and discusses different studies on safety and pharmacokinetic properties. A thorough evaluation of preclinical and clinical studies reveals both promises and challenges of this delivery method, highlighting approved drugs for the treatment of epilepsy and migraine that successfully utilize intranasal routes. The current landscape of research on nose-to-brain delivery is critically discussed, and a rationale is provided for ongoing research to optimize therapeutic strategies.",,,franziska.richter@tiho-hannover.de.
40390095,"RNA polymerase I is essential for driving the formation of 3D genome in early embryonic development in mouse, but not in human.",,Genome medicine,10.1186/s13073-025-01476-y,"Three-dimensional (3D) chromatin architecture undergoes dynamic reorganization during mammalian gametogenesis and early embryogenesis. While mouse studies have shown species-specific patterns as well as mechanisms underlying de novo organization, these remain poorly characterized in humans. Although RNA polymerases II and III have been shown to regulate chromatin structure, the potential role of RNA polymerase I (Pol I), which drives ribosomal RNA production, in shaping 3D genome organization during these developmental transitions has not been investigated. We employed a modified low-input in situ Hi-C approach to systematically compare 3D genome architecture dynamics from gametogenesis through early embryogenesis in human and mouse. Complementary Smart-seq2 for low-input transcriptomics, CUT&Tag for Pol I profiling, and Pol I functional inhibition assays were performed to elucidate the mechanisms governing chromatin organization. Our study revealed an extensive reorganization of the 3D genome from human oogenesis to early embryogenesis, displaying significant differences with the mouse, including dramatically attenuated topologically associating domains (TADs) at germinal vesicle (GV) stage oocytes. The 3D genome reconstruction timing is a fundamental difference between species. In human, reconstruction initiates at the 4-cell stage embryo in human, while in mouse, it commences at the 2-cell stage embryo. We discovered that Pol I is crucial for establishing the chromatin structures during mouse embryogenesis, but not in human embryos. Intriguingly, the absence of Pol I transcription weakens TAD structure in mouse female germline stem cells, whereas it fortifies it in human counterparts. These observed interspecies distinctions in chromatin organization dynamics provide novel insights into the evolutionary divergence of chromatin architecture regulation during early mammalian development. Our findings provide mechanistic insights into species-specific chromatin organization during germ cell and embryonic development and have potential implications for fertility preservation and birth defect prevention.",,,genetian@sjtu.edu.cn.

The objectives of this study were to describe the facilitators of, and barriers to, prostate cancer screening among men between the ages of 50 and 70. The study employed a qualitative descriptive phenomenological design. Data were collected at the oncology and urology departments of an intermediate hospital in Oshana region, Namibia using a semi-structured interview guide. Individual, face-to-face interviews were held between September and October 2022, after which the data gathered were analyzed thematically following Colaizzi's 7-step method. Fifteen (15) participants took part in this study. The two major themes that were generated were: (1) Value of early detection, which described the participants' perceptions regarding the facilitators of prostate cancer screening; and (2) Potential threats to PCa screening, which described the participants' perceptions regarding the barriers to taking up cancer screening. The study revealed modifiable barriers to PCa screening, including fear of stigmatization, lack of knowledge, and insufficient screening access, as well as facilitators that can be strengthened for successful prostate cancer screening, such as advanced age, history of prostate cancer, and social support. These findings emphasize the need to implement gender-specific campaigns that address masculinity, lack of knowledge, and cultural stigmatization.",,,ntomas@unam.na.
40389947,Effect of L-thyroxine on bone biomechanical and morphometric parameters in rats.,,BMC veterinary research,10.1186/s12917-025-04816-7,"Morphometric measurements and biomech anical tests are very crucial in determining the effects of drugs and chemicals on bones. L-thyroxine is often used instead of thyroid hormone in research conducted on experimental animals. The aim of the study is to examine the effects of L-thyroxine on the morphometric and mechanical properties of rat bones. A total of 16 healthy male Wistar Albino rats were used, including control and L-thyroxine groups. After the experimental process, the left/right humerus and femur were resected from all animals. Morphometric measurements were performed on the bones. Then, three indices of the bones were calculated using the measurement results. Three-point bending was performed to determine the effect of L-thyroxine on the mechanical properties of the bones. Humerus maximum length and proximal width difference was determined. The maximum length and proximal width of the right humerus were lower in rats that received L-thyroxine. Differences were observed in the weight, diaphysis diameter and weight/length index of the right femur. These parameters were higher in the control group. No statistical difference was detected between L-thyroxine and control groups in mechanical properties. Maximum loading, stiffness, strength and elastic modulus in the humerus were observed to be higher in the control group. However, stiffness, strength and elastic modulus in the femur were determined to be higher in the L-thyroxine group. According to the correlation between the mechanical properties of bones and conventional indices, a high correlation was found between elastic modulus and weight/length index in the humerus. In the femur, a high negative correlation was observed between maximum loading and the weight/length index. This study showed that L-thyroxine had an effect on the morphometry of long bones in rats but did not affect their mechanical properties. L-thyroxine has been observed to mainly affect the bones in the right side of the body.",,,saydogdu@selcuk.edu.tr.
40389935,Physiological and biochemical indicators in blood of captive yellow-cheeked gibbons and northern white-cheeked gibbons.,,BMC veterinary research,10.1186/s12917-025-04797-7,"Gibbons are recognized as a critically endangered primate taxon of significant conservation importance. Given their dwindling populations, accurate disease diagnosis, treatment, and management have become crucial for species preservation. However, the lack of established physiological and biochemical reference ranges currently poses substantial challenges to effective clinical assessment and disease identification in these primates. In this study, blood samples were collected from the gibbons under anesthesia to ensure safe restraint during the procedure. Thirty-four hematological and biochemical parameters were measured from three yellow-cheeked gibbons (Nomascus gabriellae) and six northern white-cheeked gibbons (Nomascus leucogenys) maintained at Beijing Zoo. The results showed that there were no conspicuous differences in hematological indicators between two species (P>0.05). Furthermore, comparative analysis of hematological parameters between the clinically diseased individual presenting with gastrointestinal symptoms (anorexia and vomiting) and established normal physiological ranges revealed significantly elevated values in hemoglobin (HGB), white blood cell count (WBC), hematocrit (HCT), serum potassium (K), serum sodium (Na), total protein (TP), albumin (ALB), serum creatinine (SCR) and blood urea nitrogen (BUN). In contrast, neutrophil count (NSG) and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) levels were below normal reference values. Notably, both SCR and BUN exceeded normal ranges by more than three-fold. This suggests that this gibbon's indigestion was caused by impaired kidney function and reduced metabolic capacity. This study represents the first comprehensive measurement of thirty-four hematological indicators in both yellow-cheeked gibbons and northern white-cheeked gibbons, which provides reference for early disease diagnosis and clinical treatment of gibbons.",,,liuzun88peng@aliyun.com.
40389891,Assessing the knowledge of key one health elements among African higher education students: African multi- center cross-sectional study.,,BMC public health,10.1186/s12889-025-22935-6,"The One Health (OH) approach addresses the interconnectedness of human, animal, and environmental health, playing a critical role in tackling antimicrobial resistance (AMR), zoonotic diseases, and climate change. Despite its importance, limited research has examined OH knowledge among African students - future professionals in public health, veterinary science, and environmental fields. This study assesses OH knowledge and its key components - AMR, zoonosis, and climate change - among higher education students across 26 African countries. A cross-sectional, multicentre study was conducted from June 2023 to February 2024, using an online survey distributed in English and French. The survey targeted higher education students from diverse academic disciplines. OH knowledge levels were evaluated based on median scores, and statistical analysis using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) software version 24 identified regional and disciplinary variations. A total of 726 students from 26 African Countries participated in the study. 88.2% of Central African students demonstrated adequate OH knowledge, while students from North Africa exhibited the lowest scores (64.1%). Non-medical students outperformed medical students in OH awareness (64.1% vs. 45.2%, p < 0.001). The most important OH issues recognized by participants included OH major goal (86.6%), concept approach (83.5%), shared health threats by people, animal, and environment (82.1%). However, knowledge gaps were evident in awareness about Carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales (65.3%), animal as an early warning sign of human illness (65%), zoonosis related to environmental toxicants. Key knowledge gaps were identified in awareness about Carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales (65.3%), animal as an early warning sign of human illness (65%), zoonosis related to environmental toxicants. However, no specific knowledge gaps were identified related to impact of climate change on health. While OH awareness among African students is relatively high, significant regional disparities and knowledge gaps remain, particularly in AMR and zoonotic disease prevention. Strengthening interdisciplinary education, enhancing regional OH initiatives, and incorporating OH into university curricula are crucial for fostering a well-informed future workforce.",Walyaro C,International Society for Infectious Diseases/Talk AB[M]R,famossa@medicine.zu.edu.eg.

Glycerylmonostearate/chitosan hybrid olive oil cored nanocapsules were fabricated by a self-assembly method. Nine batches were successfully produced based on glycerylmonostearate/chitosan ratio and olive oil concentration. Selected formulation was and evaluated for oral bioavailability enhancement and pharmacodynamics. Glycerylmonostearate/chitosan ratio strongly influence the particle size and encapsulation of the formulations. Higher concentrations of olive oil produced larger particle size, heterogeneous distribution and higher encapsulation. Embedding of SIM in system matrix with existence in amorphous state was verified by DSC and FTIR tools. Selected formulation significantly enhanced SIM oral bioavailability with a 3.27-time higher in AUC when compared to SIM suspension. In addition, in vivo prolonged effect was verified by higher elimination half-life and mean residence time in plasma. Furthermore, pathological changes in liver and aorta associated with Poloxamer 704 injection have been mostly corrected. Serum lipid profile, liver function enzymes and oxidative stress were also restored. According to these results, glycerylmonostearate/chitosan hybrid olive oil cored nanocapsules proved to be a promising formulation strategy to significantly enhance SIM peroral bioavailability and therefore therapeutic efficacy.",,,melmowafy@ju.edu.sa.

Here we introduce the disequilibrium genome-based restricted maximum likelihood (DGREML) method to simultaneously quantify the additive contribution of SNPs to heritability and that of their directional covariances. We applied DGREML to 26 phenotypes of 550,000 individuals from diverse biobanks and found that cross-autosome GPD contributes 10-27% of the SNP-based heritability of height, educational attainment, intelligence, income, self-rated health status and sedentary behaviors. We observed a differential contribution of GPD to the heritability of height between the UK, Chinese and Japanese populations. Finally, bivariate DGREML analyses of educational attainment and height show that cross-autosome GPD contributes at least 32% of their genetic correlation. Altogether, our versatile and powerful method reveals understudied features of the genetic architecture of complex traits and informs potential mechanisms generating these features.",; Goddard ME,; Centre for AgriBioscience,yuanxiang.zhang@imb.uq.edu.au.

Here we show that NUP98 fusion-expressing AML harbors an epigenetic signature that is characterized by increased accessibility of hematopoietic stem cell genes and enrichment of activating histone marks. We employ an AML model for ligand-induced degradation of the NUP98::KDM5A fusion oncoprotein to identify epigenetic programs and transcriptional targets that are directly regulated by NUP98::KDM5A through CUT&Tag and nascent RNA-seq. Orthogonal genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 screening identifies 12 direct NUP98::KDM5A target genes, which are essential for AML cell growth. Among these, we validate cyclin-dependent kinase 12 (CDK12) as a druggable vulnerability in NUP98::KDM5A-expressing AML. In line with its role in the transcription of DNA damage repair genes, small-molecule-mediated CDK12 inactivation causes increased DNA damage, leading to AML cell death. Altogether, we show that NUP98::KDM5A directly regulates a core set of essential target genes and reveal CDK12 as an actionable vulnerability in AML with oncogenic NUP98 fusions.",,,florian.grebien@vetmeduni.ac.at.

The main therapy for unresectable disease > 3 cm in diameter is Transarterial Chemoembolization. Unfortunately, overall survival for these patients has improved little in the past two decades. To address this, we propose a new approach using a chemical reaction in situ. We report here our results in a pilot study using a swine model. Domestic swine (n = 3) were treated in the liver with dichloroacetic anhydride in ethiodized oil. CT imaging was followed 24 h after the procedure by necropsy, histopathology, and mass spectrometry imaging. Animals tolerated the procedure well. Imaging showed that the solution remained stable over 24 h. Areas of coagulative necrosis were identified at histopathology. Multiplex immunofluorescence showed focal areas where antibodies did not bind. Similarly, mass spectrometry imaging showed areas of low-abundance or absent molecular ions and new molecular ions in treated areas. The data presented here provide the first direct evidence that reactive embolization results in fundamental changes in tissue architecture down to the molecular level, suggesting significant therapeutic potential. These encouraging results open a wide new field of image-guided in vivo chemistry worthy of further exploration.",,,ecressman@mdanderson.org.

This study examined three ready-to-eat foods - soft-cheese, smoked salmon, and sausage - using a food-GI-infection model. We observed strain-dependent growth rates, but food matrices did not significantly impact growth. However, nutrient sources altered gene expression. Passage through the GI model upregulated 23 stress genes and 29 virulence genes (e.g., clpE, hly, and plcB). L. monocytogenes survival was higher in cheese and fish compared to sausage, due to their lower buffer capacity. Invasion efficiency into Caco-2 cells was highest in fish, potentially linked to its fatty acid composition. Food matrices and GI conditions influenced the transcriptional profiles of stress-associated and virulence genes.

Opioids are the cornerstone of treatment of postoperative pain, but can induce severe side effects, dependence, and addiction. Novel local anesthetic applications, such as erector spinae plane blocks, and sustained release formulations have the potential to decrease opioid consumption without analgesic compromise but have limited efficacy beyond 24 h. A mismatch in duration of pain and duration of non-opioid analgesia is thus present in spine surgery. This study assessed the feasibility of a robust hydrogel for three days of sustained and stationary bupivacaine delivery, designed for co-implantation with pedicle screws, in a sheep model for spinal surgery. Fifteen sheep received six hydrogel rings loaded with bupivacaine mounted on pedicle screws (total dose 220 mg). Wound and systemic drug levels, hydrogel degradation and histological response were assessed. Moreover, in-vivo drug release was correlated to in-vitro release (IVIVC). Rings stayed in place after surgery and displayed a first-order release profile in-vivo over 72 h, with excellent IVIVC. Ring intactness after implantation did not affect release. Bupivacaine wound fluid levels exceeded plasma levels 2300-fold, and plasma bupivacaine levels were well below toxic thresholds through 168 h. Histological analysis of implant sites revealed a conventional foreign-body response that subsided during follow-up. Hydrogels degraded completely in 9 months.

40388437,Production performance in cultivated mixed-sown grasslands combining Poa pratensis L. and various Poaceae forage grasses.,2025-05-19,PloS one,10.1371/journal.pone.0324084,"Kentucky bluegrass (Poa pratensis L.), a native grass species of the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau, is widely used for ecological restoration due to its high growth rate and strong adaptability. However, monocultures of Poa pratensis are prone to rapid degradation and low productivity, limiting their suitability for animal husbandry. To address these challenges, this study evaluated the production performance and interspecific relationships of different mixed-sown and monoculture grasslands to identify optimal cultivation strategies. Field experiments were conducted over a six-year period, with three mixed-sown treatments-Poa pratensis combined with Siberian wildrye (Elymus sibiricus L.), Chinese fescue (Festuca sinensis Engler ex S.L.Lu), and alkali grass (Puccinellia tenuiflora (Griseb.) Scribn. & Merr.)-alongside their respective monocultures. LASSO regression (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator Regression) and ROC curve analysis (Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve Analysis) were applied to identify key factors influencing production performance. The results indicated that the mixed-sown grassland of Elymus sibiricus and Poa pratensis significantly boosted forage yield by 216.88% to 323.06% in comparison with monoculture Poa pratensis. Additionally, the comprehensive evaluation index, which integrates forage yield and nutritional quality, was 16.41% higher for the Elymus sibiricus and Poa pratensis mixture than for the monoculture Poa pratensis grassland. These findings imply that the mixed-sown grassland of Elymus sibiricus and Poa pratensis effectively addresses the low productivity issue often seen in monoculture Poa pratensis grasslands. However, in terms of yield stability and interspecific compatibility, the mixed-sown grassland of Puccinellia tenuiflora and Poa pratensis demonstrated superior performance. Its relative total yield (RTY) consistently exceeded 1.0 from the third to the sixth year, reflecting higher interspecific compatibility and stable productivity over time. And the Poa pratensis and Puccinellia tenuiflora mixture showed the best performance, achieving the highest stability value of 3.12. Therefore, the combination of Poa pratensis and Puccinellia tenuiflora is recommended as the optimal strategy for achieving long-term yield stability and high productivity in cultivated grasslands.",,,
40388363,Evolutionary Insights into the Length Variation of DNA Damage Response Proteins Across Eukaryotes.,,Genome biology and evolution,10.1093/gbe/evaf089,"Across the tree of life, DNA damage response (DDR) proteins play a pivotal, yet dichotomous role in organismal development and evolution. Here, we present a comprehensive analysis of 432 DDR proteins encoded by 68 genomes including that of Nucleospora cyclopteri, an intranuclear microsporidia sequenced in this study. We compared the DDR proteins encoded by these genomes to those of humans to uncover the DNA repair-ome across phylogenetically distant eukaryotes. We also performed further analyses to understand if organismal complexity and lifestyle play a role in the evolution of DDR protein length and conserved domain architecture. We observed that the genomes of extreme parasites such as Paramicrocytos, Giardia, Spironucleus and certain microsporidian lineages encode the smallest eukaryotic repertoire of DDR proteins and that pathways involved in modulation of nucleotide pools and nucleotide excision repair are most preserved DDR pathways in the eukaryotic genomes analysed here. We found that DDR and DNA repair proteins are consistently longer than housekeeping and metabolic proteins. This is likely due to the higher number of physical protein-protein interactions that DDR proteins are involved in. We find that although DNA repair proteins are generally longer than housekeeping proteins, their functional domains occupy a relatively smaller footprint. Notably, this pattern holds true across diverse organisms and shows no dependence on either lifestyle or mitochondrial status. Finally, we observed that unicellular organisms harbour proteins that are tenfold longer than their human homologs with the extra amino acids forming interdomain regions with clearly novel albeit undetermined function.",,,

This case report delineates the surgical management and subsequent outcomes of two squirrel monkeys diagnosed with massive hiatal hernias. This case report delineates the surgical management and subsequent outcomes of two squirrel monkeys diagnosed with massive hiatal hernias, offering insights into the feasibility and criticality of timely interventions, underscored by postoperative care and dietary management. The radiographic diagnosis is suggestive of a massive hiatal hernia, and this clinical suspicion was definitively corroborated during the subsequent surgical intervention. Left gastric fixation was used to reposition the herniated organs and repair and reinforce the hiatus. One subject died of unforeseeable complications 3 days after post-discharge. The other subject's hospitalization was extended to 40 days to ensure optimal recovery. Upon being discharged, the monkey's condition remained stable. This case suggested achieving long-term postoperative survival of a massive oesophageal hiatal hernia.

The present research evaluated the chondrogenic potential of poly(glycerol sebacate) copolymer nanofibrous scaffold (PGS NF) loaded with growth differentiation factor-5 incorporated sugar glass nanoparticles (SGnP-GDF5), in combination with allogenic bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSC) in a rabbit model. A full-thickness chondral defect of 4 mm diameter was created in the trochlear facet of the left femur of rabbits using a Brad point drill bit. PGS NF was used in group B, BM-MSC laden PGS NF in group C, SGnP-GDF5 loaded PGS NF in group D, and BM-MSC laden SGnP-GDF5 loaded PGS NF in group E. Five animals from each group were sacrificed on days 60 and 90 post-treatment. The samples were assessed based on gross morphology, histopathology, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) analysis to evaluate regeneration. The SGnP-GDF5 PGS NF group and the BM-MSC laden SGnP-GDF5 PGS NF group exhibited superior cartilage regeneration, closely resembling hyaline cartilage. Histopathological evaluation revealed a columnar pattern of chondrocytes, along with an optimal concentration of proteoglycans and collagen in the extracellular matrix of the newly formed cartilage, indicating robust regeneration in both groups. Furthermore, the SEM and micro-CT analysis findings highlighted the exceptional quality of the repaired tissue in these groups. The release of GDF5 from SGnP and the expedient microenvironment provided by the NF scaffold augmented chondrogenic differentiation, resulting in superior cartilage tissue regeneration.",,,merlinmamachan@gmail.com.

These infections can lead to severe haematological conditions, posing a threat to animal health and welfare. Recent studies have begun shedding light on the prevalence and impact of HM on horse populations worldwide. For instance, in Germany, Iran, Nigeria, and Brazil, at least three species of HM have been identified in horses, with a lack in knowledge in Latin American countries like Mexico. Our research aims to fill a crucial knowledge gap regarding the presence of HM in equine populations in the coastal state of Veracruz, Mexico. We collected blood samples from 134 horses and extracted genomic DNA, to target a fragment of 900 bp of the 16S-rDNA gene of HM for amplification and sequencing. Three animals (2.24% = 3/134) tested positive for the presence of HMs. Through phylogenetic reconstruction, the identity of the recovered HMs could be confirmed, providing insight into the specific species present in the equine population. The detection of Candidatus Mycoplasma haemovis and Mycoplasma haemocanis in three horses from the municipalities of Alvarado and Vega de Alatorre highlights the presence of these pathogens in the studied area. This finding not only contributes to the understanding of HM distribution in Mexico and the Mesoamerican region, but also underscores the need for further research and surveillance efforts to monitor and manage these infections in equine populations.",Ballados-González GG; Cruz-Romero A; Martínez-Hernández JM; Aguilar-Domínguez M; Grostieta E; Becker I; Sánchez-Montes S,Facultad de Medicina Veterinaria y Zootecnia; Centro de Medicina Tropical,anabcruz@uv.mx.

Animal,10.1007/s11626-025-01035-0,"Many strains of wild-type laboratory mice have been developed for studies in the life sciences, including skeletal muscle cell biology. Muscle regeneration capacity differs among wild-type mouse strains. However, few studies have focused on whether myogenic stem cells (satellite cells) are directly related to mouse strain-dependent myoregeneration gaps using in vitro culture models. In this study, we selected three major wild-type mouse strains, CD1 (outbred; Jcl:ICR [ICR]), C57BL/6NJcl (inbred; B6), and BALB/cAJcl (inbred; C), which are widely used in laboratory experiments. Initially, we compared myotube fusion capabilities using satellite cell-derived myoblasts. The results showed that cell cultures isolated from male ICR mice could not efficiently form myotubes owing to low expression levels of myogenic regulatory factors (e.g., MyoD, myogenin, myocyte enhancer factor [MEF] 2A, and MEF2C) compared with B6 and C mouse strains. Next, we compared the myofiber-type compositions of muscle tissues and cultured myotubes among male mice from each of the three strains. Although each muscle tissue used for satellite cell isolation similarly expressed fast-twitch myofiber markers in all mouse strains, male ICR-derived myoblasts formed abundant amounts of slow-type myotubes. By contrast, myotubes from male B6 and C mice expressed substantial levels of fast-twitch myofiber markers. We also performed a comparative experiment in female ICR, B6, and C mouse strains, similar to the male mouse experiments. The myogenic differentiation potencies of myoblasts and myofiber-type compositions of myotubes in female mouse strains were similar. Thus, male ICR-derived satellite cells (myoblasts) had low myogenic differentiation potential, which may be associated with the tendency slow-twitch myotube formation.",,,tsuzuki@agr.kyushu-u.ac.jp.

This study aimed to evaluate the effects of autologous cytokine-rich serum (ACRS) and platelet-rich plasma (PRP) on brain oxidative status, mineral levels, and proinflammatory cytokines in rats with CP-induced ovarian failure. A total of 42 female Wistar rats (12-weeks-old) were used in the study. Six of these rats were allocated as donors, and the remaining 36 rats were randomly distributed into six groups (n = 6 per group). Group 1 received no treatment. On the 1st and 7th days, 75 mg/kg of CP was administered intraperitoneally to Groups 4, 5, and 6. On day 1, PRP was administered intraovarianly to Groups 2 and 5, while ACRS was administered intraovarianly to Groups 3 and 6. Additionally, PRP and ACRS were administered intraperitoneally to the respective groups on 7th and 14th days.The study was terminated at the end of the 31st day. Brain tissue and blood samples were collected for biochemical analyses and ovarian tissue samples were collected for histomorphological examinations. Morphological analysis using Hematoxylin-Eosin (HE) staining and immunohistochemical evaluation for AMH, α-SMA, and IL-1β were conducted on the ovaries. Proinflammatory cytokines and insulin levels were measured using ELISA test kits. TAS/TOS levels were assessed using Relassay Diagnostic kits. Biochemical parameters and mineral levels were measured using autoanalyzer. Histopathological evaluation revealed that follicular degeneration, congestion, hemorrhage, edema, and inflammatory cell infiltration, as well as the number of atretic follicles and IL-1β immunoreactivity, were observed at the highest levels in the CP group (Group 4). In contrast, the numbers of primordial, primary, secondary, and tertiary follicles, along with AMH and α-SMA immunoreactivity levels, were found to be the lowest in this group.

CD8+ T cells play a crucial role in controlling viral latency by generating diverse memory responses in an epitope-specific manner. Among these distinct responses, conventional and inflationary memory responses have been described during herpesvirus infections. Using a newly generated TCR transgenic mouse strain, we investigated the transcriptomic and epigenetic remodeling of distinct epitope-specific CD8+ T cells during CMV infection across tissues at both population and single-cell levels. Our findings reveal that whereas the transcriptomic and epigenetic landscapes of conventional and inflationary memory responses diverge in the spleen and liver, these molecular programs converge in the salivary gland, a site of CMV persistence. Thus, we provide evidence that the dynamics of memory CD8+ T cell responses are distinct between tissues.",,,

Lipophilic membrane dyes are commonly used but have been shown to produce non-specific fluorescent particles that are indistinguishable from labelled EVs, confounding experimental results. We aimed to distinguish conditions that can either promote or reduce the formation of non-specific dye particles when using the prototypical lipophilic membrane dye PKH26. We optimised a labelling approach that minimises the production of non-specific dye particles by altering buffer conditions during staining and validated this method across cell-based and in vivo systems of EV biodistribution. To do this, we specifically isolated small EVs using ultrafiltration and size exclusion chromatography and validated sample purity and post-isolation processing steps. We then used single-EV spectral flow cytometry and transmission electron microscopy to investigate the impact of four different buffer conditions on PKH26 non-specific particle formation. We also determined the extent to which non-specific PKH26 particles were detectable in cell-based assays and in vivo within mouse lymph nodes using flow cytometry, immunofluorescence, and intravital imaging. By optimising buffer conditions to eliminate additional protein, we were able to minimise the formation of dye aggregates while maintaining efficient EV labelling, producing a much higher signal-to-noise ratio both in vitro and in vivo. We also demonstrate that failure to include proper vehicle controls can have significant implications on experimental results, leading to false positive data. This work emphasizes the importance of adequately benchmarking EV labelling approaches as it is essential for accurate evaluation of EV trafficking in physiologic and pathologic states.",,,

Our previous study revealed the pivotal role of FASN in lipid droplet (LD) synthesis and the promotion of classical swine fever virus (CSFV) replication. However, the roles of the other two key enzymes in CSFV infection remain unexplored. In this study, we screened a library of 96 lipid metabolism-targeted compounds and identified an antiviral inhibitor of SCD1, a rate-limiting enzyme in monounsaturated fatty acid synthesis, that inhibits CSFV replication. Suppressing SCD1 activity through inhibitors or small interfering RNA knockdown reduces CSFV proliferation. However, this suppression is reversed by adding SCD1 active products (oleic acid/palmitoleic acid [OA/PA]), highlighting the essential role of SCD1 in CSFV proliferation. Mechanistically, CSFV non-structural protein p7 interacts with SCD1 and recruits it to the viral replication complex (VRC) during infection. Importantly, CSFV infection activates the endoplasmic reticulum stress pathway IRE1α/XBP1, which positively regulates SCD1 expression, leading to increased production of triglyceride (TG) and LDs and subsequently enhancing CSFV replication. In summary, our study elucidates the critical role of SCD1 in the CSFV life cycle and highlights its potential as an antiviral target for developing new therapies against ",,,

However, excessive consumption of this trace element can adversely affect the overall well-being. Previous studies have demonstrated that long-term Cu intake can lead to severe hepatotoxicity. The underlying mechanism by which Cu induces disturbances in hepatic energy metabolism through modulation of mitochondria-lipid droplet (LD) contacts, however, is not known. In this study, we found that Cu exposure significantly disrupted the interaction between mitochondria and LDs, leading to the downregulation of perilipin 2 (PLIN2), perilipin 5 (PLIN5), synaptosomal-associated protein 23 (SNAP23), diacylglycerol acyltransferase 2 (DGAT2), and caveolin-1 (Cav-1) proteins in chicken livers. Mechanistically, we demonstrated that Cu exposure-induced dynamin-related protein 1 (DRP1) protein activation disrupted mitochondria-LD contacts by regulating PLIN2. DRP1 knockdown and PLIN2 overexpression efficiently promoted the mitochondria-LD contacts, alleviating Cu-induced LD accumulation in chicken primary hepatocytes. However, PLIN2 knockdown significantly exacerbated the mitochondria-LD contact disorder induced by Cu exposure. Moreover, PLIN2 knockdown dramatically reversed the ability of DRP1 knockdown to promote mitochondria-LD contacts, while overexpression of PLIN2 had the opposite effect. Overall, our study revealed that the DRP1-PLIN2 axis regulates the connections between mitochondria and LDs under Cu exposure, which may provide a new perspective on Cu exposure-induced lipid metabolism disorders in hepatocytes.",,,

Consensus is established through critical review of the peer-reviewed literature relevant to a subgroup's particular focus. In this article, the authors provide a critical review of the current literature regarding methods for the diagnosis and classification of primary nodal lymphomas of dogs, including histopathology, cytopathology, immunophenotyping and assessment of molecular clonality. Knowledge gaps in the current literature and recommendations for future study are also reported. Major conclusions of this consensus include: (1) Histopathology with immunohistochemistry is required for complete diagnosis and classification of nodal lymphomas; (2) Immunohistochemistry and flow cytometry are the most reliable methods of immunophenotyping lymphomas, though neither is clearly superior to the other; (3) Molecular clonality testing should not be used in favour of immunophenotyping assays for classifying lymphomas; and (4) The use of emerging molecular tests for diagnosing lymphomas in the absence of histopathologic, cytopathologic, or immunophenotypic disease characterisation should be restricted to investigational settings until their diagnostic validity and the clinical benefit they confer to patients are more thoroughly characterised.

In this pilot study, we evaluated the immunomodulatory effects of cowpea mosaic virus (CPMV) particles, which primarily activates innate immunity, and calreticulin nanoparticle (CRT-NP), which enhance immunostimulatory signals of immunogenic cell death in canine cancers. The study focused on their potential to induce local and systemic antitumor immune responses and achieve tumor control. CPMV was obtained through the mechanical inoculation of Vigna unguiculata, while CRT-NP was generated using cationic liposomes loaded with a CRT-expressing plasmid. Nine canine patients with oral melanoma, soft-tissue sarcoma (STS), and mammary gland carcinoma received CPMV or CRT-NP via intratumoral route. CPMV and CRT-NP was administered weekly at three-five intratumoral locations. To evaluate antitumor immune responses, biopsies and blood samples were obtained prior to treatment and during follow-up visits, extending up to one week after the final treatment. Endpoints included serum cytokine analysis, tumor transcriptomics via NanoString, immune cell profiling in blood and tumor biopsies, and efficacy assessment using RECIST criteria. CPMV exhibited an icosahedral shape (~30 nm), while CRT-NP were spherical (~300 nm). CPMV induced stable disease (SD) in two of three melanoma and STS patients, with partial response (PR) in the third. CRT-NP induced SD in two of three patients, with one STS patient achieving partial remission. Post-treatment NanoString and flow cytometry analyses revealed a shift in the tumor microenvironment toward a more immunostimulatory state, marked by increased neutrophils and CD8+ T cells. CPMV, in particular, upregulated genes involved in antigen processing and immune activation while enhancing IFNγ+ CD4+ and CD8+ T cell populations. CRT-NP reduced Tregs in the TME. Further, serum cytokine levels, such as MCP-1, GM-CSF, IL-2, IL-6, IL-7 and IL-18, correlated with tumor growth independent of various treatments. Our findings suggest that CPMV and CRT-NP, which activate distinct immunologic pathways, safely modulate the TME contributing to disease stabilization in spontaneous canine cancers. These results support the need for larger-scale trials to address current limitations, differentiate tumor-agnostic versus treatment-specific effects, and evaluate long-term clinical outcomes, including overall survival (OS).",,,

Important characteristics of MHC genes, such as the association with immunological and production traits, make them exceptional candidates for marker assisted selection. The aim of this study was to characterize MHC based on the LEI0258 microsatellite marker to evaluate the genetic variability and diversity within and between Iranian chicken populations. Blood samples were collected from six indigenous ecotypes (n=633) and Ross 308 (n=216) as a commercial breed. The MHC variability was determined based on a microsatellite marker located within MHC, LEI0258. Polymerase chain reaction and fragment analysis was used for microsatellite polymorphism detection. Based on the fragment analysis, 7 alleles were found in Ross 308 and 25 alleles across all 6 populations.

SaVs from animals including pigs, chimpanzees, and rodents have been reported to be closely related with human SaVs, indicating the possibility of cross-species transmission. Divergent SaVs have been reported in various bat species across various continents including Asia, Europe, Oceania and Africa. However, little is known about the evolutionary history of SaVs across various bat species and their zoonotic potential. In this report, we describe the findings of a surveillance study across various bat species in Nigeria. Samples were pooled and subjected to metagenomics sequencing and analyses. Nine of 57 sample pools (containing 223 rectal swabs from five bat species) had SaV reads from which we assembled a total of four complete and three near-complete (having complete coding sequences) genomes. The bat SaV (BtSaV) strains from this study formed five distinct lineages of which four represented novel genogroups. BtSaV lineages clustered mainly according to bat families, which might suggest a likely virus-host-specific evolution. The BtSaV VP1 capsid protein structure prediction confirmed three main domains (S, P1, and P2) as reported for Human SaV (HuSaV). We found that the P2 subdomain of the VP1 protein contains a degree of homology to known immunoreactive epitopes suggesting these conserved regions may be valuable for diagnostics or medical countermeasure development.

Recent work has clearly demonstrated age-related deficits in ECM synthesis with aging, as well as some changes to metabolic activity. Since glucose metabolism is critical to protein synthesis and known to be altered in aging, we sought to investigate if age-related changes in metabolism are linked to changes in ECM remodeling. We used our previously developed flexor tendon explant model to expose young and aged tendon explants to various concentrations of glucose and glutamine supplementation and observe changes in metabolic activity, matrix composition, matrix biosynthesis, and expression of metabolic and ECM genes. We hypothesized that elevated levels of glucose and glutamine would lead to increased ECM remodeling as well as elevated gene expression of their respective pathways in young tendons, with no such effect in aged tendons. Interestingly, we found that glutamine processing is affected by glucose levels with increased expression of key glutamine processing pathways with increased glucose, but this effect was lost with aging. We also observed that ECM remodeling is directly related to both glucose and glutamine processing with altered glycosaminoglycan and collagen synthesis with glucose and glutamine media concentration. Overall, our work reveals that glucose and glutamine are intricately linked for both tenocyte health and ECM homeostasis and that their metabolism could be one of the key drivers of age-related deficiencies in tissue maintenance.",,,

Solutions included therapy, medication, self-acceptance, and personalized accommodations. Neurominorities highlighted positive strengths such as empathy, creativity, and attention to detail. Veterinarians in this survey expressed a need for more awareness and acceptance of neurodiversity within the profession. The results of this survey support the need for increased awareness and acceptance of neurominorities in veterinary medicine and an understanding of the unique challenges they face during their careers.",,,

To compare iron deficiency prevalence in cats with CIE versus low-grade alimentary lymphoma (LGAL) and secondarily, determine the effect of iron deficiency on short-term clinical response in CIE cats. Twenty-eight client-owned cats with primary gastrointestinal disease, including 14 CIE cats and 14 LGAL cats. Prospective study. Cats were enrolled when they presented for gastrointestinal endoscopy. Iron panel (serum iron, ferritin, total iron binding capacity), CBC, cobalamin, serum amyloid A, methylmalonic acid, and clinical disease severity were evaluated. Cats were categorized as ""normal"" or ""iron deficient"" using calculated transferrin saturation. CIE cats were reevaluated 14, 30, and 90 days after initiation of non-standardized gastrointestinal disease treatment. Clinical response was compared based on iron and anemia status. Iron deficiency was diagnosed in 7/28 cats (2/14 CIE, 5/14 LGAL cats) at enrollment and developed in four additional CIE cats during follow-up. While 9/28 cats were anemic at enrollment, neither anemia (relative risk [RR], 0.90; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.13-5.50) nor iron status (RR, 0.4; 95% CI, 0.10-1.5) was associated with treatment response. Transferrin saturation was lower in LGAL cats (22%; 95% CI, 20%-27%) than in CIE cats (30%; 95% CI, 26%-39%). There was high prevalence of iron deficiency over the first 90 days of treatment in CIE cats.

40384228,The Role of DGAT1-AluI  and CAST-MspI Polymorphisms in Early Growth Traits of Morkaraman Lambs.,2025-05-19,Veterinary medicine and science,10.1002/vms3.70395,"Farm animals' birth weight and postnatal live weight gain (LWG) are essential for offspring survival and meat yield. This study investigated the relationship between DGAT1-AluI and CAST-MspI polymorphisms, DGAT1-AluI and CAST-MspI genotypic interaction and LWG in Morkaraman lambs. A total of 514 Morkaraman lambs were genotyped for DGAT1-AluI and CAST-MspI polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) methods. The TT genotype in the DGAT1-AluI  polymorphism consistently exhibited higher birth weight and weights at 30th, 60th and 90th days compared to the other genotypes. At the MM genotype, CAST-MspI showed an association between the 30th and 60th and weaning weights. In this study, we found that the M allele for the CAST-MspI polymorphism positively influenced growth performance in sheep. However, the TT genotype in the DGAT1-AluI was associated with even better growth performance. On the other hand, we determined for the first time that the TTMN genotype interaction in the DGAT1 × CAST genes serves as a robust genetic marker for weight gain at birth and on the 30th, 60th and 90th days. In conclusion, it is suggested that the DGAT1 × CAST gene TTMN genotype interaction, identified for the first time in this study, may serve as a novel and effective marker for body weight gain in the Morkaraman sheep breed.",,,

To determine if urine ammonia-to-creatinine ratio (UACR) correlates with serum creatinine as a renal function marker in healthy cats and cats with CKD and whether UACR is related to the presence of CKD. The study group comprised 74 healthy and 45 stable IRIS stage 2-4 CKD cats. Prospective, single-time point study. Serum biochemistry variables were measured. Urinary ammonia and creatinine concentrations were measured and used to calculate UACR. Group comparisons were made using the Mann-Whitney test. Correlation between UACR concentrations and serum renal and electrolyte values used Spearman's correlation test. Relationships between UACR, renal variables, electrolytes, urine specific gravity, age, and body weight were explored with multiple linear regression. Chronic kidney disease cats (median 4.2; range 0.6-9.2) had lower UACR than healthy cats (median 7.6; range 3.0-23.7; p < 0.01). UACR was inversely correlated with creatinine concentration (p < 0.01, r These findings suggest that ammonia excretion is impaired with declining renal function.",Brown EE,Austin Veterinary Emergency and Specialty,
40384217,Effect of Fenofibrate on Markers of Gut Barrier Function in Dogs With Naturally Occurring Diabetes Mellitus.,2025-05-19,Journal of veterinary internal medicine,10.1111/jvim.70125,"Fenofibrate improves gut barrier function and reduces serum lipids in purpose-bred dogs with induced diabetes mellitus (DM), but its effects in dogs with naturally occurring DM are unknown. Determine the effects of fenofibrate on markers of systemic and pancreatic inflammation, markers of gut barrier function, lipoprotein profiles, and glycemic control in dogs with naturally occurring DM. Sixteen client-owned dogs with naturally occurring, uncomplicated DM. Longitudinal cohort study. Dogs were treated with fenofibrate (Tricor, 6-10 mg/kg, P.O., once daily) for 21 days. Interstitial glucose, serum cytokines, lipopolysaccharide (LPS), pancreatic lipase, and lipid profiles were compared between baseline and day 21 using paired t-tests and Wilcoxon signed-rank tests. Fenofibrate had no effect on glycemic control, serum cytokines, or serum pancreatic lipase. Compared to baseline, the concentrations of serum LPS decreased at day 21 by (mean ± SD) 15 ± 24% (95% CI 2-28%, p = 0.03), serum triglycerides decreased by 36 ± 39% (95% CI 15-56%, p = 0.002), and serum cholesterol decreased by 20 ± 14% (95% CI 12-28%, p < 0.0001). Fenofibrate treatment was not associated with a decrease in markers of systemic or pancreatic inflammation. In diabetic dogs, short-term fenofibrate treatment appears to be safe, and the improvement in gut barrier function and lipid profiles might lead to long-term benefits, such as reduction in pancreatitis risk and frequency of signs of gastrointestinal disease.",,,

To determine if using a procalcitonin-guided algorithm may safely reduce duration of antibiotic therapy compared to standard of care in hospitalised children with suspected or confirmed infection. A pragmatic, multicentre, open-label, parallel two-arm, individually randomised controlled trial with internal pilot phase, qualitative study and health economic evaluations. Paediatric wards or paediatric intensive care units within children's hospitals ( Children aged between 72 hours and 18 years admitted to hospital and being treated with intravenous antibiotics for suspected or confirmed bacterial infection. Procalcitonin-guided algorithm versus usual standard care alone. Coprimary outcomes were duration of intravenous antibiotic use and a composite safety measure. Between 11 June 2018 and 12 October 2022, 1949 children were recruited: 977 to the procalcitonin group [427 female (43.7%), 550 male (56.3%)], and 972 to the usual care group [478 female (49.2%), 494 male (50.8%)]. Duration of intravenous antibiotics was not significantly different between the procalcitonin group (median 96.0 hours) and the usual care group (median 99.7 hours) [hazard ratio = 0.96 (0.87, 1.05)], and the procalcitonin-guided algorithm was non-inferior to usual care [risk difference = -0.81% (95% confidence interval upper bound 1.11%)]. At clinical review, a procalcitonin result was available for 81.8% of the time, which was considered as part of clinical decision-making 66.6% of the time, and the algorithm was adhered to 57.2% of the time. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratio per duration of intravenous antibiotics hour avoided from bootstrapped samples was £467.62 per intravenous antibiotic hour avoided. Cost analysis of complete cases was also higher in the procalcitonin arm for all age groups, and for children aged 5 years and over. The intervention is not cost-effective as it is more expensive with no significant improvement in intravenous antibiotic duration. Robust antimicrobial stewardship programmes were already implemented in the lead recruiting sites, and adherence to the algorithm was poor. Clinicians may be reluctant to adhere to biomarker-guided algorithms, due to unfamiliarity with interpreting the test result. In children hospitalised with confirmed or suspected bacterial infection, the addition of a procalcitonin-guided algorithm to usual care is non-inferior in terms of safety, but does not reduce duration of intravenous antibiotics, and is not cost-effective. In the presence of robust antimicrobial stewardship programmes to reduce antibiotic use, a procalcitonin-guided algorithm may offer little added value. Future trials must include an implementation framework to improve trial intervention fidelity, and repeated cycles of education and training to facilitate implementation of biomarker-guided algorithms into routine clinical care. This trial is registered as ISRCTN11369832. This award was funded by the National Institute for Health and Care Research (NIHR) Health Technology Assessment programme (NIHR award ref: 15/188/42) and is published in full in  A daily task in hospitals is to assess whether sick children have an infection or not, and doctors need to decide whether to start, stop or change antibiotics. On one hand, giving antibiotics promptly saves lives, but on the other, giving antibiotics to people who do not need them leads to overuse of antibiotics resulting in antibiotics no longer working for infections, so-called antibiotic resistance. If we can reduce antibiotic use in hospitals, this would be an important step in combating the spread of hospital superbugs. Blood tests can be used to measure the body’s response to infection. Most hospitals in the National Health Service use blood tests to monitor whether a person is responding to antibiotics. One example is C-reactive protein, but this test does not always tell you whether there is an infection there and if it is getting better, or whether the person is just unwell from another reason. A blood test measuring procalcitonin is better for diagnosing bacterial infections, and procalcitonin levels are quicker to decrease when a patient starts to improve and antibiotics start working, compared to C-reactive protein levels. However, procalcitonin tests are not routinely used for children in the National Health Service. The BATCH trial looked at whether the use of a procalcitonin test is safe and could help doctors decide whether to stop or change antibiotics (from intravenous to oral), both of which safely reduce antibiotic use (and help limit antibiotic resistance), compared to not using the test. The trial found that in children admitted to hospital with a bacterial infection, the addition of the procalcitonin test is safe to use but does not reduce how long intravenous antibiotics were given for. Doctors did not always use the procalcitonin result when making antibiotic decisions, and although parents were largely positive about participation in the trial, some had concerns about extra blood tests and clinicians stopping antibiotics too early. Future research should include education and training for doctors to ensure that the procalcitonin test forms part of routine care.",Hinds L; Jones S; Preston J; Carrol ED; ,; Sheffield Children's NHS Foundation Trust; Involve Network; NIHR Alder Hey Clinical Research Facility; Department of Infectious Diseases,

The second eye of dogs affected with PACG (20) that had already developed elevated IOP in the first eye and normal dogs (12) with no history of glaucoma. Serial goniophotographs of all quadrants of the iridocorneal angle were obtained every 9 months over approximately 18 months in normal dogs. Images were obtained every 3 months in dogs with PACG until that eye developed elevated IOP. A modified ZibWest score was calculated for each image. The earliest ZibWest score was then compared with the last ZibWest score for each eye. Additionally, matched images from the same quadrant from the first and last time point were presented to masked experienced evaluators to see whether the progression of abnormalities could be detected. A difference in ZibWest scores between the first and the last time point for each eye was not detected across all dogs (p = 0.3673), within dogs affected with PACG (p = 0.2665), or normal dogs (p = 0.3953). Experienced evaluators were unable to detect significant progression of pectinate ligament abnormalities.

Human milk for VPIs (n = 225) was fortified with bovine colostrum (BC, intact proteins, high bioactivity) or conventional fortifier (CF, hydrolysed bovine whey proteins). Plasma was sampled at fortification start (T0, ~1 week of age) and after one (T1) and two (T2) weeks. Changes in Z-scores for weight, length and head circumference (HC) were calculated from T0 to 35 weeks postmenstrual age. Compared with CF, BC fortification increased 12 AAs (~10-40%, p < 0.05) and reduced Lys concentrations (10-16%, p < 0.05). Analysed across groups, T0-T2 AA increments associated positively with HC growth (12 AAs) and IGF-1 concentrations (5 AAs), and inversely with gestational age (13 AAs) and weight (8 AAs) at birth. The plasma protein profile (proteome) was unaffected by fortification. BC fortification increased the plasma concentrations of many AAs. Fortification-induced AA increments associated positively with HC growth and IGF-1 concentrations, and were affected by immaturity and birth weight. Still, plasma AA variability within physiological levels appears to have limited implications for clinical outcomes during the early life of VPIs. It is unknown how human milk fortification affects plasma amino acid concentrations, in turn influencing growth patterns in very preterm infants. We show that a fortifier based on bovine colostrum induces higher amino acid concentrations than a conventional fortifier. Fortification-induced increments in amino acid concentrations associated with gestational age, birth weight and head growth, but with small effect sizes and limited relation to body weight or length growth. Plasma amino acid concentrations are influenced by fortification of human milk in early life, but have limited practical application as predictors of body growth and health in individual very preterm infants.",,,pts@sund.ku.dk.
40383852,Xylazine potentiates the interoceptive effects of fentanyl in male and female rats.,,Psychopharmacology,10.1007/s00213-025-06804-z,"Xylazine, a sedative typically used in veterinary medicine, has been increasingly detected as an adulterant in the unregulated opioid supply and present in opioid overdose deaths. Therefore, xylazine-adulterated fentanyl is a growing public health concern. People who use drugs have reported that xylazine changes and prolongs the effects of fentanyl. We used standard operant drug discrimination procedures to better understand how xylazine impacts the discriminative stimulus/interoceptive effects of fentanyl. Male and female Long-Evans rats (n = 23) were trained to discriminate fentanyl (0.032 mg/kg intraperitoneal) such that one lever was reinforced with sucrose on days when fentanyl was administered, and the other lever was reinforced when vehicle was administered. Once rats met testing criteria, we tested a dose range of fentanyl to confirm discriminative stimulus control, then we tested if xylazine alone produced fentanyl-like effects and if the addition of xylazine to fentanyl impacted fentanyl interoceptive effects. Stimulus control was confirmed, as rats showed increased percent responses on the fentanyl-appropriate lever as well as decreased response rates for increasing doses of fentanyl. Xylazine alone did not substitute for the stimulus effects of fentanyl but produced similar response rate reductions as fentanyl alone. Xylazine co-administered with fentanyl potentiated the stimulus effects of lower doses of fentanyl in both males and females and potentiated response rate reductions. These results indicate that xylazine enhances the interoceptive effects of fentanyl, which may inform clinical research about xylazine-adulterated fentanyl.",,,joyce_besheer@med.unc.edu.

This study investigated the roles of NLRP3 inflammasome activation and cardiac mast cell (CMC) behavior in diabetic ovariectomized (OVX) rat models. Female Wistar rats were divided into five groups: sham-operated, OVX, diabetic (Sham-DM), OVX-diabetic (OVX-DM), and OVX-DM treated with the NLRP3 inhibitor MCC950. Diabetes was induced using a high-calorie quick fat diet (13.8% crude fat, 24.35% crude protein, 25% sucrose; 406.80 kcal/100 g) followed by a single intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin (30 mg/kg). MCC950 (10 mg/kg BW, intraperitoneally) was administered daily for 4 weeks. Echocardiography revealed significant diastolic dysfunction in OVX-DM rats, with increased left ventricular internal diameter (LVIDd) and reduced mitral valve E/A ratio, while MCC950 treatment partially restored diastolic function (p < 0.05). Masson's trichrome staining showed increased myocardial fibrosis in OVX-DM rats (2.59 ± 0.20%) compared to Sham-DM (1.94 ± 0.16%, p < 0.05), which was reduced with MCC950 treatment (0.88 ± 0.13%, p < 0.05). Western blot analysis demonstrated elevated expression of NLRP3, cleaved caspase-1, IL-1β, and GSDMD-N in OVX-DM hearts. MCC950 significantly reduced cleaved caspase-1, IL-1β, and GSDMD-N expression without altering NLRP3 protein levels. Additionally, mast cell degranulation was markedly increased in OVX-DM rats (62.14%) compared to controls (P < 0.05) and was attenuated by MCC950 (31.06%, P < 0.05). These findings suggest that NLRP3 inflammasome activation under conditions of estrogen deficiency and diabetes contributes to myocardial pyroptosis and mast cell degranulation, driving cardiac remodeling in postmenopausal DCM. Targeting NLRP3 pathways may provide an effective therapeutic strategy to mitigate diastolic dysfunction, fibrosis, and inflammation in diabetic hearts.",,,Sukanya.pu@wu.ac.th.

Its extensive and improper use with insufficient monitoring has raised concerns about antimicrobial resistance (AMR). Veterinarians' opinions on antimicrobial agents and AMR are crucial in shaping their prescription practices. Understanding these opinions and practices is essential for mitigating the impact of AMR. Therefore, a questionnaire-based cross-sectional study was conducted to investigate the antimicrobial prescription practices and antimicrobial knowledge of veterinarians in Palestine. Descriptive and statistical analyses were performed at a confidence interval of 95%. A survey targeting 358 veterinarians in Palestine received 104 responses (29.1%). The majority of respondents were male (92.3%) and aged 31-40 (47.1%) or under 30 (42.3%). Most practiced in Hebron (31.7%), while others practiced in Jenin (14.4%), Tulkarm (11.5%), and Nablus (11.5%). The practices mainly included mixed practices (48.1%), farm animals (26.0%), and small animals (13.5%). Training on antimicrobial agents was primarily in English (93.3%), lasting five years (91.3%), with 40.4% having multiple course emphases in nonclinical years and 46.2% in clinical years. Only 57.7% had no additional degrees, but 54.8% attended training courses or conferences. Most veterinarians (64.4%) felt that they did not overprescribe antimicrobial agents, although 41.3% used them in 41-60% of cases. Clinical signs were relied upon for prescriptions by 85.6%, but only 39.4% had access to laboratory facilities for antimicrobial susceptibility testing. Most respondents (76.0%) acknowledged antimicrobial misuse, and 71.2% felt there was inadequate supervision of AMU. AMR was seen as a serious issue by 99.0%, with improper prescription habits cited as a major cause (81.7%). Recommendations to combat resistance included conducting sensitivity tests, enhancing veterinary oversight, promoting biosecurity, and enforcing stricter regulations on antimicrobial sales and use. This study provides valuable insights into the knowledge, attitudes, and practices of veterinarians in Palestine regarding AMU and AMR. The study underscored gaps in oversight, with many respondents feeling that there was inadequate supervision of AMU in veterinary practice. The findings highlight the need for enhanced training, stricter regulations, and improved monitoring to mitigate the risks of AMR effectively. By implementing these recommendations, it is possible to promote responsible AMU, safeguard public health, and ensure the continued effectiveness of antimicrobial agents for future generations. Addressing these challenges will require a concerted effort from all stakeholders to create a robust framework for antimicrobial stewardship in veterinary practice.",,,ibrahimzuhair@najah.edu.

This study explored the protective and therapeutic potential of laminaran derived from the brown seaweed Undaria pinnatifida in promoting mucin secretion and restoring mucosal barrier integrity. Physicochemical analysis revealed laminaran as having a β-(1 → 3)-linked glucose backbone with β-(1 → 6)-linked branches and a molecular weight of 14.41 kDa. In vitro experiments revealed that laminaran enhanced the expression of mucin-related proteins in a lipopolysaccharide-induced LS174T model. Laminaran also upregulated the expression of sulfotransferases, which are essential for mucin sulfation, and promoted vesicular transport by increasing the expression of vesicle-associated membrane protein 8 and synaptosome-associated protein-23, facilitating mucin secretion. These effects are mediated through the protein kinase C (PKC) pathway, which involves PKCα and PKCβII. In an in vivo model, laminaran alleviated dextran sulfate sodium-induced colitis, increasing mucus thickness and overall intestinal barrier function. These results suggest that laminaran is a promising therapeutic agent for treating ulcerative colitis, suggesting a novel approach to restoring the mucosal barrier and reducing intestinal inflammation. This study lays the groundwork for developing laminaran-based treatments for ulcerative colitis and other intestinal diseases associated with epithelial barrier dysfunction.",,,xianqiangchen@yeah.net.

40383392,"Perceived barriers of dairy producers to the adoption of selective antimicrobial therapies for non-severe clinical mastitis and at dry-off in dairy cattle: A focus group study in Ontario, Canada.",,Journal of dairy science,10.3168/jds.2025-26491,"Prudent antimicrobial use (AMU) in the dairy industry is crucial as it affects animal health, welfare, and could help to slow the development of antimicrobial resistance. There is a need to adopt selective AMU. However, the barriers to adoption of selective antimicrobial use for the management of mastitis and dry-off are not adequately described. The objective of this study was to understand the barriers that dairy farmers in Ontario faced in the adoption of selective antimicrobial therapy for non-severe clinical mastitis and at dry-off in dairy cattle. Six focus groups were held in 2 regions of Ontario [southwestern (n = 3) and eastern (n = 3)] involving 35 dairy farmers. Three themes were identified from the transcribed discussions; 1) experiences with selective antimicrobial mastitis and dry-off therapies, 2) risk tolerance for selective antimicrobial mastitis and dry-off therapies, and 3) factors influencing the adoption of selective antimicrobial mastitis and dry-off therapies. Participants viewed the decision to adopt selective antimicrobial mastitis and dry-off therapies to be the responsibility of the dairy producer. They described the use of bacterial diagnostics for selective treatment of non-severe clinical mastitis as frustrating because results were not delivered in time to inform treatment. Some participants were not receptive to selective dry-off therapy because they perceived it placed their cows at high risk for mastitis during the next lactation. Participants who used selective dry-off therapy often mitigated these initial concerns by beginning this strategy with a small group of low production animals. Individual cow data from automatic milking systems and record keeping were viewed as instrumental to the success of selective AMU but human elements (e.g., visual assessment of animals) continued to be used in the decision-making process. Some participants described cognitive dissonance and a reluctance to change when selective AMU to manage mastitis appeared to be in conflict with previously recommended blanket treatment practices. Our results suggest that cognitive dissonance experienced by participants may be mitigated by information from trusted sources, such as veterinarians. Additionally, peer-to-peer learning opportunities (e.g., dairy producers learning from colleagues' experiences and reflecting on their own current practices) could be used to facilitate evaluation of whether adoption of selective AMU aligns with their management approach for clinical mastitis. Therefore, until rapidity of mastitis diagnostics and communication of results improves for selective lactation therapy, and the perceived mastitis risk related to selective dry-off therapy is addressed, challenges will continue for the adoption of best management practices for selective antimicrobial therapy for non-severe clinical mastitis and at dry-off in dairy cattle.",,,michael.w.brunt@gmail.com.
40383390,"Effects of feeding a simulated waste milk on growth, health, fecal microbiota, and antibiotic resistance in dairy heifer calves.",,Journal of dairy science,10.3168/jds.2024-26062,"Feeding waste milk, a common practice in dairy farming, exposes calves to subtherapeutic levels of antimicrobials, potentially contributing to antibiotic resistance-a growing concern globally. Many dairy farmers, including those in Ireland, continue this practice, feeding waste milk from antibiotic-treated cows to calves. Although previous studies have linked waste milk feeding to changes in calf growth and health during the preweaning period, its effects postweaning remain unclear. This study examined how the duration of antimicrobial exposure at levels equivalent to those found in waste milk influences health and growth outcomes of dairy heifer calves both before and after weaning. It also assessed the prevalence of extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL)-resistant Escherichia coli in feces and changes in the fecal microbiota over time. To mimic waste milk, as derived from a cow treated with an intramammary suspension of antibiotics, a simulated waste milk (SWM) was prepared by adding amoxicillin (1.68 mg/L) and neomycin (2.28 mg/L) to a conventional milk replacer (MR). The study employed a randomized block design with 87 dairy heifer calves assigned to 1 of 3 treatments: (1) long-term antibiotic (LTA), with calves fed SWM until weaning at 12 wk; (2) short-term antibiotic (STA), with SWM fed from 3 to 5 wk; and (3) control (CONT), with calves fed antibiotic-free MR. Calves were weighed weekly, and health scores, including fecal scores (tail and hindquarters cleanliness as diarrhea indicator), were recorded twice per week. Fecal and blood samples were collected to analyze microbiome changes and the shedding of antimicrobial resistance. Blood samples were taken to measure systemic inflammation, using serum amyloid A as a biomarker. Results indicated that SWM feeding did not affect average daily gains before or after weaning. However, higher fecal scores were observed in the LTA group during weaning and after weaning in the STA group. Antibiotic-resistant isolates were present in all groups, with the highest prevalence in LTA. Fecal microbiota analysis revealed treatment-specific microbial community variations, with increase of Enterococcus faecium genes resistant to macrolide, aminoglycoside, and tetracycline antibiotics in LTA and STA compared with CONT. In summary, SWM feeding did not significantly affect growth or overall health, but it was associated with increased fecal shedding of resistant bacteria and some changes in the microbiota, indicating potential long-term implications for antimicrobial resistance in dairy herds.",McFadden M; Allendez G; Murphy JP; Kennedy E,Teagasc,Emer.Kennedy@teagasc.ie.

Prioritizing functional variants and causal genes of conformation traits is essential for understanding their genetic basis. In this study, we conducted single-trait and multitrait GWAS for 20 body conformation traits using imputed sequence data in 7,674 Chinese Holstein individuals and identified 27 QTL regions. Leveraging these QTL regions, we performed multitrait Bayesian fine-mapping to identify 30 independent credible sets of putative causal variants. Incorporating GWAS and cis-acting expression QTL data, Mendelian randomization was used to infer 153 putative causal gene-trait relationships. The previously reported genes, such as CCND2, TMTC2, and NRG3, were confirmed in our study. Of note, several novel candidate causal genes were also identified, such as C1R, RIMS1, SERPINB8, NETO2, TTYH3, TTC3, ANAPC4, and PSMD13.

However, dynamic changes in the gut microbiota and metabolome during TGEV infection remain unclear. This study investigated these alterations and their association with intestinal damage in weaned pigs during early TGEV infection. Thirty 4-week-old pigs were allocated randomly into TGEV-inoculated and mock groups. On days 3, 5, and 7 postinoculation, intestinal tissue and fecal samples were collected. Full-length 16S rRNA sequencing and ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC‒MS/MS) were employed to analyze microbiota composition and nontargeted metabolites. TGEV infection resulted in reduced villous height-to-crypt depth (VH:CD) ratios (P < 0.01) and significantly altered microbial diversity (P = 0.0091 in jejunum) and composition (P = 0.001). Notably, infected pigs showed increased abundances of Lactobacillus and Limosilactobacillus species. The VH:CD ratio correlated with the overall taxonomic composition in both the jejunum and ileum (r = 0.4, P < 0.001) and was positively associated with microbial functions such as aerobic chemoheterotrophy and chitinolysis in the jejunum. Fecal metabolomics revealed 1,815 and 892 differentially expressed metabolites in the jejunum and ileum, respectively, including amino acids, fatty acids, and intermediates of energy metabolism. Integrated analysis revealed that Lactobacillus amylovorus DSM20531 was positively correlated with linoleic acid, L-tyrosine, and citric acid, whereas Lactococcus lactis showed a negative correlation with isocitric acid and glutamine. This study enhances our understanding of the pathogenesis of TGEV and provides potential microbial and metabolic biomarkers for future diagnostic and preventive strategies.",,,ymcvm@mail.npust.edu.tw.

The pH microenvironment after CAB is critical for the healing process, but there are few functional biomaterials for this purpose at present. Herein, we develop a multifunctional hydrogel contact lens (CL) with on-demand release of citric acid (CA) and cannabinoid (CBD), triggered by alkaline conditions, to regulate the microenvironment pH and enhance CAB repair. The CA-functionalized polyvinyl alcohol (PC) and quaternary ammonium chitosan (QCS) are used as hydrogel frameworks, with CBD incorporated as a functional component. The (CBD/QCS/PC, CBD/QPC) hydrogel CL is fabricated using a repeated freeze-thaw process to achieve an interpenetrating network structure. The findings suggest that the 1CBD/QPC hydrogel CL exhibit superior mechanical properties and biocompatibility (hemolysis rate < 0.6 %, cell viability>90 %). These properties enhance wearing comfort and reducing secondary inflammation. Notably, this hydrogel can release CA (52.23 ± 2.78 %) and CBD (59.24 ± 5.15 %) within 24 h under alkaline conditions to neutralize pH, significantly down-regulate the expression level of inflammatory factors and remove hydroxyl radicals. This mechanism fundamentally addressing the secondary damage of residual lye following CAB. Moreover, the hydrogel CL exhibit potent inhibitory effects on the colonization and growth of both E. coli and S. aureus by destroying bacterial membranes, with an inhibition rate > 90 %. In vivo results show that hydrogel CL promote the repair of CAB through anti-inflammatory effects and angiogenesis inhibition. In conclusion, these results demonstrate the potential of this hydrogel CL for treating corneal alkaline burns, providing new insights into treatment of CAB.",,,xpliao@scau.edu.cn.
40383149,Key Amino Acids in RNA Polymerase and Helicase Proteins Regulate RNA Synthesis Efficiency in Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome Virus.,,The Journal of biological chemistry,10.1016/j.jbc.2025.110247,"Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) exhibits rapid evolution due to its high mutation rate and frequent recombination, posing significant challenges for disease control. In this study, we investigated the molecular mechanisms underlying strain-specific variations in PRRSV replication phenotypes. Using reverse genetics and molecular biology approaches, we established a non-infectious replicon model that simulates PRRSV genomic replication and subgenomic (sg) mRNA transcription at the cellular level. This model enabled the evaluation of regulatory effects of viral non-structural proteins (nsps) and transcription-regulating sequences (TRSs) on viral replication and transcription, revealing the crucial roles of nsp9 and nsp12 in RNA synthesis. Furthermore, we developed a subgenomic replicon system (sg-Rep-PRRSV) driven by a minimal replication-transcription complex (mini-RTC) to investigate the impact of specific mutations in PRRSV replicase-associated proteins on viral RNA synthesis efficiency. Our findings demonstrated that mini-RTC components derived from XM-2020 exhibited significantly higher transcriptional driving efficiency compared to those from GD strain (p < 0.01). Site-directed mutagenesis analysis identified critical amino acid residues contributing to differential RNA synthesis efficiency between strains: E141N, N416H, and S591A in nsp9, and S51D, L57T, and K349E in nsp10. These adaptive mutations likely modulate the catalytic conformations of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and helicase, ultimately contributing to the distinct replication phenotypes observed among PRRSV strains. Our findings provide an insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying PRRSV evolution and adaptation, which have significant implications for mitigating future PRRS outbreak risks and maintaining sustainable development of the swine industry.",,,yfzhou@njxzc.edu.cn.
40382661,Microsporidian infection of mosquito larvae changes the host-associated microbiome towards the synthesis of antimicrobial factors.,2025-05-17,Parasites & vectors,10.1186/s13071-025-06813-z,"Microsporidians (Microsporidia) are a group of obligate intracellular parasites that commonly infect mosquitoes. Recently, it has been shown that infection by these parasites can alter the composition and functionality of the mosquito-associated microbiome. The host-associated microbiome of the mosquito can play a pivotal role in various physiological processes of this host, including its vector competence for pathogens. Thus, understanding how microsporidians shape the mosquito microbiome may be crucial for elucidating interactions between these parasites and their mosquito hosts, which are also vectors for other parasites and pathogens. The effects of microsporidian infection on the microbiome structure and functionality of Culex pipiens and Culex torrentium larvae under semi-natural conditions were examined. The host-associated microbiome of Cx. pipiens (n = 498) and Cx. torrentium (n = 465) larvae, including that of the 97 infected individuals of these samples, was analysed using 16S DNA profiling and functional prediction analysis. Microbiome network analysis revealed that, in the microsporidian-positive larvae, host microbial communities consistently grouped within a common bacterial module that included Aerococcaceae, Lactobacillaceae, Microbacteriaceae, Myxococcaceae, and Polyangiaceae. Indicator species analysis revealed two strong positive correlations between microsporidian infection and the presence of Weissella cf. viridescens and Wolbachia pipientis. Functional predictions of microbiome content showed enrichment in biosynthetic pathways for ansamycin and vancomycin antibiotic groups in infected larvae. Furthermore, the MexJK-OprM multidrug-resistance module was exclusively present in the infected larvae, while carbapenem- and vancomycin-resistance modules were specific to the microsporidian-free larvae. Our results demonstrate that microsporidian infection alters the microbial community composition in mosquito larvae. Moreover, they show that microsporidian infection can increase the antimicrobial capabilities of the host-associated microbiome. These results provide novel insights into host microbiome-parasite interactions and have potential implications for the vector competencies of mosquitoes.",Herren JK,International Centre of Insect Physiology and Ecology,arturtrzebny@amu.edu.pl.
40382642,Comparative antinociceptive and sedative effects of epidural romifidine and xylazine in dromedary Camels (Camelus dromedarius).,2025-05-17,BMC veterinary research,10.1186/s12917-025-04706-y,"In this study, the pain-relieving and calming effects of giving romifidine and xylazine through an epidural in camels were compared. Twenty-one adult camels (9 non-pregnant females and 12 intact males) weighing between 400-450 kg were randomly divided into three equal groups. Each group received one of the following treatments: an equal volume of sterile saline, 0.17 mg/kg of xylazine, or 50 g/kg of romifidine. All of the treatments were put directly into the sacrococcygeal space after being diluted in 0.9% sterile saline solution until the final volume was 20 ml. Before treatment and then at 5, 10, 15, 30, 60, 90, 120, 150, and 180 min after administration, the perineal analgesia, sedation, and degree of ataxia were evaluated. At these same times, rectal temperature (RT), heart rate (HR), and respiration rate (RR) were simultaneously measured. Epidural administration of romifidine and xylazine resulted in varying degrees of sedation, ranging from mild to deep, alongside complete antinociception affecting the perineum, inguinal area, and flank. This effect extended distally to the coronary band of the hind limbs and cranially to the thoracic region. After romifidine, analgesia started more quickly than with xylazine (6 ± 1.05 vs. 14.17 ± 0.83). The duration of both antinociceptive for romifidine was substantially longer than that of xylazine (159 ± 6.38 vs. 63.33 ± 2.47). The onset time of sedation was substantially shorter after romifidine (6.8 ± 0.83 min) compared to xylazine (10.8 ± 0.83 min). Romifidine's sedative effect lasted longer than xylazine's (149.17 ± 4.16 vs. 108.33 ± 1.05 min). At every study measurement point, the romifidine and xylazine-treated groups showed negligible RT, HR, and RR changes. Conclusion: Romifidine or xylazine may be a reliable, durable, and economical method for epidural anesthesia in camels undergoing standing surgery, as romifidine has a faster onset and longer antinociceptive effect. Therefore, epidural romifidine could be a more effective treatment option for immediate postoperative pain.",,,m.abumandour@yahoo.com.

Recognizing OA as a heterogenous disorder with diverse aetiologies and molecular foundations underscores the need to classify patients by both phenotypes and molecular pathomechanisms (endotypes). Such stratification could enable the development of targeted therapies to surmount existing treatment barriers. From a scientific, economic, and ethical perspective, it is crucial to employ animal models that accurately represent the endotype of the target patient population, not merely their clinical symptoms. These models must also account for intrinsic and extrinsic factors, like age, sex, metabolic status, and comorbidities, which impact OA's pathogenesis and its clinical and molecular variability and can profoundly influence not only structural and symptomatic disease severity and progression but also the underlying molecular pathophysiology. The molecular definition of the OA subpopulation must also be reflected in the read-outs, as the traditional methods-macroscopic and histological scoring, along with limited gene expression profiling of established biomarkers for cartilage degradation, extracellular matrix (ECM) turnover, and synovial inflammation-are inadequate for discovering new, phenotype- and endotype-specific biomarkers or therapeutic targets. Thus, animal model characterisation should evolve to include both clinically and pathophysiologically pertinent measures of disease progression and response to treatment. This review evaluates the utility and accuracy of current animal models in OA research, focusing on their capacity to replicate the disease's pathophysiological processes.",,,mario.rothbauer@meduniwien.ac.at.

This study assessed the feasibility and accuracy of a remote real-time continuous glucose monitoring system (RT-CGMS) integrated with intelligent tracking in diabetic dogs. Seven Beagle dogs were monitored using interstitial sensors across different configurations: adhesive only, adhesive with protective garments, and garments combined with an innovative glucose monitoring approach for remote transmission. Sensor wear time was slightly longer with garments (8.2 ± 6.7 vs. 5.8 ± 3.1 days; P > 0.05). Valid data acquisition was significantly higher in the remote-monitoring group [95 (84, 96)] compared to Group 1 [67 (47, 78)] and Group 2 [76 (64, 80), P < 0.001 for both]. A strong correlation was found between RT-CGMS and PBGM measurements (r = 0.904). Calibration improved accuracy at glucose levels ≥ 5.5 mmol/L, reducing MARD from 28.5 to 14.5% and increasing Bland-Altman agreement from 48 to 67%. However, MAD slightly increased in the < 5.5 mmol/L range (2.2 to 2.7 mmol/L). Frequent hyperglycemia, high variability, and glucose excursions were observed. In conclusion, RT-CGMS with intelligent tracking improved data continuity and accuracy in diabetic dogs. Future research should focus on improving the system's sensitivity under hypoglycemic conditions and exploring its broader applications, including its role in enhancing in-hospital glucose management, utilizing big data to facilitate online diagnostics and offline follow-up care, providing guidance for daily glucose stabilization, enabling personalized veterinary services, and offering subscription-based health reports for pet owners.",Zhang Q,AccuraLink Technologies Ltd.,pingfan6779@163.com.
40382559,Rapid whole genome sequencing for AMR surveillance in low- and middle-income countries: Oxford Nanopore Technology reveals multidrug-resistant Enterobacter cloacae complex from dairy farms in Sri Lanka.,2025-05-17,BMC veterinary research,10.1186/s12917-025-04800-1,"Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a major global challenge that disproportionately affects low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Environmental contamination by resistant bacteria from animal production facilities is a major driver of the spread of AMR through the food chain, requiring a robust one-health control approach. Traditional culture-based AMR surveillance is time-consuming and less sensitive, and fails to fully capture the spectrum of AMR, evolutionary trends, and epidemiological patterns of AMR spread. Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) has revolutionized AMR surveillance capabilities. Rapid WGS captures the full AMR spectrum with minimum samples, aids source attribution, and provides insights into trends in AMR spread. The portable Oxford Nanopore® Technology (ONT) platform, coupled with open-source software such as Galaxy and Konstanz Information Miner (KNIME), enables the establishment of a potentially portable, transferable workflow for low-resource settings. This study aimed to assess the AMR burden on four dairy farms in Kandy, Sri Lanka, via a resource-limited LMIC using a low-cost high-throughput screening assay and rapid WGS via ONT with Galaxy and KNIME processing to obtain full antibiotic resistomes. The four isolates exhibiting the highest minimum inhibitory concentrations for amoxicillin were identified as Enterobacter cloacae and E. hormaechei by WGS. Chromosomes (4.8 to 4.9 Mb) carry the strain-specific resistance genes blaCMH-1, blaACT-25, fosA_7, and ramA, which are associated with diverse antibiotic classes. Plasmids, including IncFIB (pECLA), IncFII (pECLA), and IncX3, carry multiple resistance genes, including AAC(3)-IIe, AAC(6')-Ib-cr, APH(3″)-Ib, APH(6)-Id, blaCTX-M-15, blaNDM, blaOXA-1, blaTEM-1, dfrA14, QnrB17, catII, determinant-of-bleomycin-resistance, and sul2. Novel arrangements of insertion sequences were observed in E. hormaechei plasmids. The phenotypic resistance of all the isolates matched the genotypic MDR profiles, including resistance to chloramphenicol, gentamicin, tetracycline, and cotrimoxazole. ONT WGS with Galaxy and KNIME processing may be a feasible option for AMR surveillance in resource-limited LMICs. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first in-house whole-genome analysis workflow in the country tailored for AMR surveillance. The presence of potentially pathogenic high-MIC, MDR Enterobacter spp. with wide resistomes, including the blaNDM gene, emphasizes the urgent need to address AMR in animal production facilities within a one-health framework.",,,priyangaw@sci.pdn.ac.lk.

This study was conducted to evaluate potential changes in hematological factors and the levels of minerals or trace elements in the serum of overweight cats. A cross-sectional study was carried out, and seventy-two client-owned, healthy adult cats were randomly selected from those visiting veterinary clinics in Mashhad. The cats were divided into two groups on the basis of their Body Condition Score (BCS): the ideal weight group (BCS = 5) and the overweight group (BCS ≥ 6). Serum concentrations of calcium, phosphorus, iron, magnesium, zinc, copper, and 25(OH) vitamin D and hematological parameters, including red blood cell (RBC) count, white blood cell (WBC) count, hemoglobin, mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH), corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC), hematocrit, mean corpuscular volume (MCV), and red cell distribution width (RDW), were measured. Correlations between the variables were also determined. Overweight cats had significantly higher levels of iron, hematocrit, hemoglobin, RBC, and MCHC. Conversely, the levels of phosphorus, RDW, WBC, neutrophils, and monocytes were significantly lower in overweight cats than in those with ideal body weights. There were no significant differences in the other parameters measured between overweight and ideal-weight cats. Additionally, in the entire population and the normal-weight group, 25(OH) vitamin D showed a positive correlation with calcium and a negative correlation with magnesium. In conclusion, being overweight in cats causes changes in their hematological parameters and the concentrations of certain elements in blood serum, specifically iron and phosphorus. These changes were in reference interval thus, the clinical significance of these alterations requires further investigation especially in obese cats.",,,mohri@um.ac.ir.

It can provide forage for animals and has high ecological value. In this study, 26 communities of P. centrasiaticum were chosen, and an examination of phenotypic characteristics and environmental variables was conducted to explore the phenotypic diversity of P. centrasiaticum germplasms and determine the climatic factors that affect its growth. Results showed that Mainling County had the lowest altitude of the sampling site, measuring 2883 m, whereas Gamba County had the most significant altitude of the sampling site, measuring 4567 m. The analysis of phenotypic features in P. centrasiaticum indicated a significant abundance and diversity of germplasms within the Yarlung Zangbo River Basin. Strong correlations were observed between climatic factors and phenotypic traits, suggesting a close relationship between the growth characteristics of P. centrasiaticum and the environment. Precipitation was significantly positive correlated with plant height (r = 0.51), Number of above-ground internodes (r = 0.72), ear length (r = 0.54), ear width (r = 0.66), and dry weight (r = 0.65), which increased biomass production of P. centrasiaticum. As altitude climbed, plant height, stem diameter, heading rate, and dry weight decreased, whereas the ratio of the last internode increased. A principal component analysis was performed on 12 phenotypic variables of P. centrasiaticum. These qualities were categorized into three primary components, accounting for 81.13% of the total contribution. This research concludes that the Yarlung Zangbo River Basin exhibited a significant morphological variation in P. centrasiaticum germplasms. Altitude and precipitation caused phenotypic changes of P. centrasiaticum in the upper and middle reaches of the Yarlung Zangbo River. The germplasms obtained from this region can potentially expedite the use of indigenous grass species in mitigating soil erosion, safeguarding ecological integrity, and facilitating forage breeding on the Tibetan Plateau.",Yang SH; Wu HY,Shigatse Grassland Workstation; Xizang Ecological Harmony Seed Industry Co,mayushou@sina.com.

The most prominent hallmark of AD pathogenesis is the formation of amyloid-β plaques, among other associated pathways such as neurofibrillary tangles, mitochondrial dysfunction, neuroinflammation, and oxidative stress. Butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE), an acetylcholine-degrading enzyme, plays a critical role in the progression of Alzheimer's disease, particularly through its involvement in amyloid-β plaque formation. Thus, the inhibition of BuChE is considered a valuable therapeutic strategy for the management of AD. The present study aimed to identify potential bioactive chemicals from naturally occurring dietary compounds that could improve neurocognitive function and appear as a viable treatment for AD by inhibiting the function of BuChE. A small library of 44 natural dietary chemicals from a variety of dietary plants was subjected to comprehensive in silico studies, including molecular docking, molecular mechanics generalized born surface area (MM-GBSA) calculations, pharmacokinetics assessments, toxicity profiles, molecular dynamics (MD) simulation, and density functional theory (DFT) analysis. These studies revealed that CID 129886986 and CID 115269 showed stronger binding affinities with drug-likeness and no toxicity than the FDA-approved standard drug, Donepezil.

In this study, we collected eight samples of interdigital webs from the fore- and hindlimbs of turtles at embryonic stage 19 (TK19) for RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis. We identified 608 differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Whole-mount in situ hybridization (WISH) and real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) of representative genes confirmed the accuracy of the transcriptomic results. These findings not only provide new perspectives and data to support comparative studies of adaptive convergent evolution in aquatic animals but also enhance our understanding of the mechanisms underlying tetrapod limb morphogenesis. Furthermore, these results provide potential molecular targets for research on the plasticity of programmed cell death or senescence.",,,zwang@syau.edu.cn.

Here, we performed an analysis of publicly available data of 208,233 Salmonella genomes in 148 countries/regions between 1900 and 2023 and explored driving indicators of AMR. Overall, we found that the geographic distribution of AMR varied depending on the location, source, and serovar. The proportion of AMR levels increased across six continents, especially in serovars Agona, Dublin, I 1,4,[5],12:i:-, Muenchen, Senftenberg, Mbandaka mainly from chickens, food, wild animals, and the environment, while decreased in Schwarzengrund and Saintpaul mainly from cattle, pigs, and turkeys. We also found that S. Typhimurium exhibiting macro, red, dry, and rough was detected as early as 1992 in the USA, earlier than in China. Moreover, we identified that antibiotic consumption, agriculture, climate, urban, health, and socioeconomic factors contribute to the development of AMR in Salmonella. We present a globally high-resolution genetic atlas of Salmonella and also identify some factors driving the rise of AMR, which can provide valuable information for understanding the transmission dynamics and evolutionary trajectories of Salmonella.",,,wangyanan1001@henau.edu.cn.

By analyzing genomic and epidemiological data collected in the US from 2014 to 2023, we show that epidemics consisted of multiple co-circulating transmission lineages that could emerge from all regions and often rapidly expanded. Lineage spread was characterized by strong spatiotemporal hierarchies and lineage size correlated with timing of establishment in the US. Mechanistic epidemic simulations, supported by phylogeographic analyses, suggest that competition between lineages on a network of human mobility consistent with commuting flows drove lineage dynamics. Our results suggest that the processes that disseminate viruses nationwide are highly structured, but variability in the short-term processes that determine the locations, timing, and explosiveness of initial epidemic sparks limits predictability of regional and national epidemics.",,,c.a.russell@amsterdamumc.nl.

It offers significant health benefits, however due to its high pungency, this makes its pure form very challenging to consume orally. The main aim of this study is to prepare Capsicum oleoresin microparticles for oral delivery and to characterize and evaluate their cytotoxicity, in vitro stability and controlled release in gastrointestinal conditions. Gum Arabic (GA), OSA-modified corn starch (EMCAP), modified malt (MALT), and their ratio 1:1 combination (GA: EMCAP; EMCAP: MALT; MALT: GA) were employed as wall materials resulting in six different oil-in-water emulsions containing 15 % solids (5 % Capsicum oleoresin and 95 % wall material). These formulations were homogenized and spray dried. The encapsulation efficiency of each formulation was determined by Ultra Performance Liquid Chromatography (UPLC). The formulated microparticles, individual microparticle components, and Capsicum oleoresin were tested for cytotoxicity on human intestinal monolayers Caco-2 and HepG2 liver cells. Furthermore, the INFOGEST static in vitro simulation assessed the digestion of microparticles using UPLC to obtain % capsaicin release. The highest encapsulation efficiency was obtained for EMCAP: MALT (90.4 %), MALT: GA (90.2 %), and GA (90.5 %). LC-QToF analysis identified capsinoids, capsaicinoids, and organic compounds in Capsicum oleoresin and microparticles. Identification of these components was also confirmed by Raman spectroscopy. All particles exhibited irregular surfaces, teeth concavities, and different sizes typical of spray-dried particles using carbohydrates as wall material. In vitro, cytotoxicity studies of all formulations with five concentrations ranging from 5 to 100 μg/ml showed no significant cytotoxicity after exposure times of 4 h on Caco-2 and 72 h on HepG2 cells. Microparticles resulted in higher degradation of color and capsaicin during storage at 45 °C compared to at 25 °C. In vitro digestion showed MALT: GA microparticles started with a 7.4 % release in the oral phase after 2 min of digestion. A further 2 h incubation in simulated gastric fluid resulted in a cumulative release of 25 %, followed by 78.6 % of capsaicin after 4 h in the intestinal fluid. This data reassures us about MALT: GA's effective capsaicin delivery potential, which presents a better profile of delivering capsaicin in high amounts into the intestine. These findings contribute to developing more efficient delivery systems, providing new insights into bioactive compounds' stability, released profiles, and safety, thus paving the way for improved applications in functional foods.",,,agsilva@unicamp.br.

Detecting and quantifying biofilms are crucial tasks; however, their inherent complexity and heterogeneity, particularly in immature stages, present substantial challenges. Innovative techniques are necessary for accurate biofilm measurement, despite the presence of diverse interfering agents. An assessment of multispecies biofilms from cattle abattoir environmental samples (wall, basin, and door), equipment (tub, knives, and swivel), and offal (heart, lung, liver, spleen, rumen, and intestine). To elucidate the complexities of biofilm formation, a dual-pronged approach was employed, utilizing epifluorescence microscopy and optical interferometry to conduct a comprehensive analysis of biofilms that had developed on two distinct types of surfaces. Specifically, biotic surfaces that had undergone chilling and abiotic surfaces subjected to chlorination were examined to gain a deeper understanding of the structural and compositional characteristics of these microbial communities. Additionally, the presence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria within the submerged biofilm was evaluated. Despite chilling, the multispecies biofilm continued to grow from 0.2 μm to a maximum of 1.75 μm on the beef spleen surface, demonstrating the interplay of different bacterial species in biofilm formation on biotic surfaces. The highest antibacterial resistance was recorded for Staphylococcus simulans, followed by Staphylococcus saprophyticus and Staphylococcus aureus. In conclusion, the optical interferometer is a straightforward, fast, and sensitive technique for measuring biofilm thickness within the range of 0.1 to 4 μm.

Interleukin (IL)-1β serves a crucial part as a gate keeper of inflammation in DON-induced macrophages, but an overview of how DON exposure elicits IL-1β secretion from RAW264.7 cells has not been fully illustrated. Here we found that the cellular phenomenon, involved with a type of programmed cell death known as pyroptosis, contains: 1) increase of pro-IL-1β expression, 2) motivation of caspase-1, 3) caspase-1-dependent maturement of IL-1β, 4) caspase-1 fragmentation of gasdermin D (GSDMD), and 5) IL-1β secretion through GSDMD pore.

Toxicology & pharmacology : CBP,10.1016/j.cbpc.2025.110226,"Mycotoxins are the major widespread hazardous substances in feed and food and are widely distributed throughout the world. Mycotoxins are a major food safety concern since they can produce substantial toxic and carcinogenic consequences in human and animals when consumed. Trichothecenes (TCTs), a class of highly toxic mycotoxins mainly generated by Fusarium species, are among the most prevalent food pollutants. Deoxynivalenol (DON), largely biosynthesized by Fusarium graminearum and Fusarium culmorum, along with T-2 toxin generated chiefly by Fusarium langsethiae and Fusarium sporotrichioides, represent the most agriculturally significant TCT subtypes. There are still no effective control strategies. Furthermore, phytochemicals have received widespread attention as natural compounds with strong antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and detoxifying effects. Because of the powerful antioxidant effects of phytochemicals, researchers have begun to look at ways to counteract the intense toxicity of TCT. Focusing on the global challenge of TCTs, this comprehensive review systematically examines contamination patterns of DON and T-2 toxin, elucidates their multi-organ toxicity pathways, and critically evaluates emerging evidence on phytochemical-based interventions targeting DON and T-2 toxin-induced health impairments. It concludes that These findings demonstrate that phytochemicals counteract DON and T-2 toxin toxicity by suppressing oxidative stress-mediated pathways, including pyroptosis, ferroptosis, apoptosis, and inflammatory responses. Accordingly, the direct addition of phytochemicals to food and feed is expected to be a promising prospect for the detoxification of DON and T-2 toxin, considering their safety, efficiency, and accessibility.",,,boxiang20172020@126.com.

Foraging livestock can be poisoned through ingestion of locoweed resulting in economic loss. Swainsonine is the main toxic component of locoweed and chemically belongs to indolizidine alkaloids. The mechanism of the swainsonine-induced toxic responses is not well understood. In this study, we performed comprehensive transcriptomic analysis examining the differential gene expression in primary renal tubular epithelial cells (RTECs) of rats treated with swainsonine. Our analysis uncovered differential expressions of ncRNA(DEncRNAs) and mRNAs(DEmRNAs) in response to swainsonine treatment. Significant pathways enriched by differential genes through transcriptome association analysis were xenobiotic metabolism-cytochrome P450, bile secretion, and steroid biosynthesis, etc. Notably, aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR)-regulated xenobiotic pathway is significantly activated as evidenced by the coordinated up-regulation of the classic AhR-regulated battery of genes Cyp1a1, Cyp1b1, AhRR, Nqo1, and phase II enzyme Gsta2, Gsta3, Gsta5. These results suggest that swainsonine is metabolically detoxified through the AhR regulated xenobiotic detoxification pathway and furthermore, our finding also suggest an intervention strategy to ameliorate to locoweed poisoning through activation of AhR-regulated deoxification pathway.",,,luhao@nwsuaf.edu.cn.

Trained immunity, driven by metabolic and epigenetic reprogramming of innate immune cells, offers a novel platform for adjuvant discovery. However, current studies predominantly focus on classical inducers such as β-glucan and BCG, limiting the exploration of key genes underlying trained immune responses. Here, we introduce a phenotypic evaluation model using Galleria mellonella larvae, identifying the gut commensal Enterococcus faecalis as a potent inducer of trained immunity. Through bioactivity-guided fractionation, we identified ribosomal protein S11 (RPS11) as the active agonist. Mechanistically, RPS11 induces trained immunity through TLR4-TET2 signaling-mediated ribosomal biogenesis inhibition, thereby shaping the enhanced MHC molecule expression phenotype in trained antigen-presenting cells. Notably, RPS11 conjugated with superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (RSNPs) significantly boosted the efficacy of an influenza vaccine. These findings highlight that harnessing the synergistic effects of innate and adaptive immune memory, combined with nanoparticle-based delivery of trained immunity agonists, presents a promising strategy for advancing next-generation vaccines against infectious diseases.",,,chw_cc@jlu.edu.cn.

This study investigates the anti-cancer potential of damnacanthal in breast cancer cell lines BT-20 and MCF-7, highlighting its regulatory effects on key biomarkers NAG-1 (Nonsteroidal Anti-inflammatory Drug-Activated Gene-1) and CRM1 (Chromosome Region Maintenance 1). NAG-1 is recognized for its pro-apoptotic and anti-tumorigenic roles, while CRM1 is associated with oncogenic activity. We found that damnacanthal treatment significantly increased NAG-1 expression and decreased CRM1 expression in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Functional assays demonstrated that damnacanthal inhibited cell proliferation, reduced colony formation, and decreased tumor spheroid size. Mechanistically, luciferase reporter assays revealed that damnacanthal activates the -133 to +41 region of the NAG-1 promoter through C/EBP-β. Real-time PCR and Western blotting analyses confirmed that NAG-1 is upregulated transcriptionally, whereas CRM1 is downregulated post-translationally via enhanced protein degradation, as evidenced by cycloheximide chase assays. Molecular docking suggested direct binding of damnacanthal to CRM1, potentially explaining its reduced stability. Additionally, damnacanthal induced autophagy by upregulating NAG-1, as indicated by increased LC3-II expression and autophagic flux, further confirmed by immunocytochemistry. These findings suggest that damnacanthal exerts potent anti-cancer effects by modulating NAG-1 and CRM1 expressions, inhibiting tumor cell growth, and inducing autophagy.

In the present study, a vaccine was developed using a human type 5 adenovirus vector to express the FCoV-I S protein (rAd5-FCoV-S) to induce the immunogenicity of rAd5-FCoV-S through oral and intramuscular immunization in mice and cats. Both vaccination methods stimulated a higher IgG antibody response. However, oral vaccination led to a significantly higher SIgA antibody level, which was 4.8 times and 2.4 times greater than that induced by intramuscular vaccination in mice and cats, respectively, with the highest level reaching 1:128. In addition, oral vaccination increased the count of IFN-γ-producing and IL-4-producing splenocytes in mice, effectively boosting cellular immune responses. Challenge protection experiments in cats showed that oral vaccination with rAd5-FCoV-S provided 100 % protection compared to a survival rate of only 33 % for unvaccinated cats. Compared to the PBS group, oral rAd5-FCoV-S administration substantially decreased the FCoV viral load within the feces, rectal tissues, and colon tissues of cats. Hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining and immunohistochemical analysis of rectal and colonic tissues revealed that cats in the oral group exhibited minimal intestinal damage, whereas PBS cats presented significant inflammatory cell infiltration and shedding of intestinal epithelial cells.

The capsid protein (Cap) is the sole structural protein of PCV, with a crucial role in virus evolution and pathogenesis. Through interactions with host factors, Cap enables viral entry, transport, and replication while modifying various cellular processes. Cap protein-induced apoptosis has important implications for viral pathogenesis, but remains poorly defined. Herein, we demonstrated for the first time that PCV3 Cap induced cell cycle arrest of PK-15 cells in S-phase and initiated apoptosis via a mitochondrial Caspase-9-dependent pathway. Truncation analysis localized the apoptotic determinant to the N-terminal 1-34 aa of PCV3 Cap and heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein K (hnRNP K) was identified as a host protein that binds to PCV3 Cap. Overexpression of hnRNP K reduced PCV3 Cap-induced release of Cyt-c into the cytoplasm, implying a regulatory role in apoptosis. Based on structural modelling and molecular docking, amino acids at sites 24 and 27 of Cap from PCV3 variants, which define genotypes (PCV3a/b/c), affected binding with hnRNP K. Specifically, PCV3c Cap (V24/K27 and V24/R27) had higher affinity than PCV3a Cap (A24/R27) or PCV3b Cap (A24/K27), consistent with its superior apoptosis-inducing capacity compared to PCV3a/b variants, highlighting the importance of Cap interactions with hnRNP K.

Comprehensive data on tick abundance and the underlying ecological drivers are crucial for developing awareness and control strategies and to assess future changes in tick-borne disease risk. We aimed to provide a Germany-wide map of I. ricinus abundance to aid in disease transmission risk assessment. During 2018-2020, questing tick density was assessed at 83 sites across the whole country by drag flagging, whereby 49,344 I. ricinus nymphs and adults were collected. Relationships between climate, land cover, and monthly questing I. ricinus nymph density were explored and used to draw an abundance map. Highest tick hazard was observed in areas near the coast with mild winters and moist springs, and in mid-elevation mountain ranges, which represent popular tourist destinations. The ticks' seasonal activity pattern was predominantly unimodal. The fact that the observed regional differences are contradictory to a previous estimation based on a combination of regional studies illustrates the need for an extensive and coordinated sampling effort to reliably estimate tick abundance at larger spatial scales. Combined with data on tick-borne pathogens, our study enables estimating the density of infected ticks and consequently the risk of acquiring an infectious tick bite.

In addition, the reprogramming mechanism needs further elucidation. In this study, we constructed a series of expression vectors for cat-derived reprogramming transcription factors based on the piggyBac transposon system and transfected various factor combinations into cat fetal fibroblasts (CFFs) under different electroporation conditions to generate cat iPSCs (ciPSCs). Additionally, the specific roles of these factors in reprogramming were investigated. The results showed that under the optimized electroporation conditions (DMEM/F12 buffer, 300 V, 10 ms pulse duration, 2 pulses, 25 μg plasmid DNA, and 4 mm cuvette), the survival rate and transfection efficiency of CFFs reached 64 % and 67.8 %, respectively. Based on this condition, a seven-factor combination (cOSKM + pNL + SV40 Large T) was confirmed as a better inducer for establishing ciPSCs. The obtained ciPSCs exhibit good pluripotency and passaging stability. They express stemness-related genes and proteins, and can form embryoid bodies (EBs) capable of differentiating into all three germ layers. OCT4 (O), SOX2 (S), KLF4 (K), and c-MYC (M) play important cooperative and synergistic roles in the mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition (MET) during the initial stages of reprogramming, while the supplement of NANOG (N) and LIN28 (L) can further promote MET and is important for successful reprogramming.

Ejaculates from six dogs were processed with Tris-based diluents and divided into four groups: MSC-exo, 1.5 % SP-exo, 2 % SP-exo, and control, and frozen. After thawing, sperm motility, viability, membrane integrity, chromatin integrity, morphological integrity, and gene expression levels were analyzed. The results showed that the MSC-exo group had significantly higher total motility (%60.31 ± 6.12), progressive motility (%22.09 ± 3.34), plasma membrane integrity (%66.94 ± 2.24), and viability (%70.88 ± 1.95) compared to the other groups (P < 0.05).

This enables the synthesis of multiple proteins from a single gene, which is important for viral growth. We developed a method to quantify RNA editing efficiency using Oxford Nanopore Technologies' MinION platform. We performed sequence analysis of reverse transcription-PCR amplicons with the RNA editing sites in cells infected with Sendai virus (SeV) and canine distemper virus (CDV). By modifying reverse transcription primers, we simultaneously assessed RNA editing efficiency in mRNA, antigenome and genome. We observed distinct differences in mRNA editing efficiency between SeV and CDV. Notably, while RNA editing in SeV is confined to mRNA, in CDV it is also observed in antigenome/genome. (Anti)genomes harboring extra nucleotides may deviate from a multiple-of-six sequence, suggesting that RNAs not following the ""Rule of Six"" are produced in CDV-infected cells.",,,ymatsu@vet.kagoshima-u.ac.jp.

At echocardiographic examination, cardiac hypertrophy, right pulmonary artery branch rigidity and diastolic and systolic dysfunction were identified. At necropsy, there was pericardial effusion and the heart was diffuse and markedly enlarged, with thickening of the left ventricular wall and interventricular septum. Both kidneys were small, firm and irregular. Microscopically, there was hypertrophy of cardiomyocytes and myocardial interstitial fibrosis. Renal changes were compatible with nephrosclerosis and hypertensive vasculopathy. Hypertensive arteriolar changes were also present in small vessels of the spleen. Based on the clinicopathological findings, a diagnosis of cardiorenal syndrome was made. Our findings indicate that the cardiorenal syndrome in this black spider monkey was remarkably similar to that reported in humans.

This study conducted an 8-year retrospective analysis (2017-2024) of GI parasites in dairy cattle across 11 districts in Bangladesh. Data were sourced from a private veterinary diagnostic laboratory, with a focus on the prevalence, types, and trends of GI parasites as well as associated risk factors. GI parasites were identified using different coproscopic methods including direct smear, flotation, and sedimentation. Statistical analysis was performed using descriptive analysis, followed by Poisson regression. The most prevalent parasites identified were Schistosoma spp. (57.3%) and Paramphistomum spp. (22.6%), with notable peaks in prevalence during the years 2019 (65%) and 2021 (62%) for Schistosoma spp. and in 2017 (32%) for Paramphistomum spp. Other parasites, such as Balantidium (B.) coli, presented a lower but consistent prevalence (9.8%), whereas Fasciola spp. and Haemonchus spp. were identified less frequently. The analysis revealed that various factors significantly influenced parasite incidence, including seasonal variations, district-specific ecological conditions, and animal-related factors. Statistical analyses, particularly Poisson regression, demonstrated that male cattle (RR: 0.30, 95% CI: 0.230-0.401) had a lower risk of infection with Schistosoma spp. than females, whereas regions with abundant water bodies, such as Manikganj (RR: 11.9, 95% CI: 6.801-20.648, p < 0.001), Mymensingh (RR:7.9, 95% CI: 2.243-27.78, p < 0.01), and Narayanganj (RR: 6.6, 95% CI: 3.867-11.177, p < 0.001), presented higher prevalence rates. Seasonal trends revealed increased prevalence rates during the winter (Schistosoma spp.: RR: 1.5, CI: 1.090-1.919, p < 0.05; Paramphistomum spp.: RR: 1.03, 95% CI: 0.322-3.299; B. coli: RR: 1.2, 95% CI: 0.672-2.151; and Fasciola spp. RR: 2.5, 95% CI: 1.322-4.555), which aligns with periods of more significant water usage and potential exposure to contaminated sources. This study underscores the need for targeted parasite control programs, particularly in high-risk areas, and advocates for improved livestock management practices and regular veterinary interventions to mitigate the economic and health impacts of GI parasites. These findings provide valuable insights for developing tailored parasite management strategies to increase the productivity and well-being of dairy cattle in Bangladesh.",Bristi SZT; Masroure AJ,Department of Veterinary Medicine and Animal Sciences,iqramul.haq@sau.edu.bd.

This study aimed to evaluate the diet and its apparent digestibility in captive giant anteaters, seeking to understand the relationship between the offered diet and its utilization by animals under human care at institutions and zoos in the state of São Paulo. Seventeen adult giant anteaters (Myrmecophaga tridactyla), comprising 10 females and 7 males, were used to determine the nutritional composition of their diet, collect feces for bromatological analysis, and assess diet digestibility. The chemical composition of the offered foods and feces was evaluated, and the apparent digestibility of the diet was calculated. Analysis of the diets revealed that their nutritional composition did not differ significantly among institutions, despite variations in ingredient composition. The protein and lipid contents of the diets were as follows: 25.6% and 6.4% (diet 1), 34.7% and 10.9% (diet 2), 31.9% and 10.3% (diet 3), and 38.2% and 12.7% (diet 4), respectively. Ether extract (EE) had the highest apparent digestibility coefficient (ADC) (general mean 91 ± 4.8). The mean ADC was 68.9, 67.6, 79.6, and 89.9 for crude protein (CP); 89.8, 88.8, 92.5, and 94.2 for EE; 44.8, 64, 71.1, and 95.3 for nitrogen-free extract; and 80.5, 43.5, 43, and 87.1 for crude fiber, for diets 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively. It is concluded that diets at São Paulo institutions showed good digestibility, especially for crude protein and ether extract. However, most animals had soft feces, indicating room for improvement. Energy intake affected body condition, emphasizing the need for tailored diets. Ether extract should not exceed 10%, and diets should provide 75-100% of maintenance energy, with regular monitoring of body condition scores.",Testa CAEP; Carneiro L; Dierenfield ES,São Paulo Zoo; Bauru Zoo; Zootrition Animal Nutrition Consulting,thais.gentini@unesp.br.

Recently, an outbreak of sarcoptic mange has affected maned wolves in part of their range; therefore, it is a priority to assess the clinical manifestation of the disease. A total of 20 maned wolves were evaluated in Southeast Brazil, 12 of which from research projects and eight were rescued between 2008 and 2023. Since the clinical signs of the sarcoptic mange vary considerably, the maned wolves were classified according to the degree of clinical manifestation and the lesion severity. According to the extension of the body affected by sarcoptic mange, two maned wolves (10%) were classified as level I (< 25% of the body affected), five (25%) as level II (26-50% of the body affected), three (15%) as level III (51-75% of the body affected), and ten maned wolves (50%) as level IV (76-100% of the body affected). By lesion severity, five maned wolves (25%) had type A lesions (mild lesions), ten (50%) had type B lesions, and five (25%) had type C lesions (severe lesions). The maned wolves classified as III-C and IV-C were transferred to captivity to receive intensive veterinary care.

The lack of effective treatment for OA creates a need for the development of new therapeutic approaches that may rely on stem cells including mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSCs) and their derivatives such as extracellular vesicles (EVs). The objective of this study was to evaluate the impact of MSCs derived from adipose tissue (AT-MSCs) and umbilical cord (UC-MSCs) and their EVs on cartilage-bone injury in vivo, to identify the specimen with the highest regenerative potential for further clinical applications in patients with OA. Humanized pigs underwent cartilage-bone injuries followed by intraarticular administration of products containing AT-MSCs, UC-MSCs, AT-MSC-EVs or UC-MSC-EVs mixed with hyaluronic acid (HA) or HA alone (for comparison). After 6-m follow-up, almost-fully-healed cartilage-bone defects were observed in the AT-MSC- and UC-MSC-treated pigs, and the defects were filled primarily with hyaline cartilage. In AT-MSC-EV- and UC-MSC-EV-treated pigs, a partial cartilage-bone tissue repair was observed, and the defects were filled primarily with fibrocartilage. The control pigs demonstrated limited regeneration capacity. The microcomputed tomography parameters of the subchondral bone indicated the ongoing progression of OA in controls, whereas in the MSC- and MSC-EV-treated pigs, the parameters indicated the cessation of OA progression. Moreover, no serious side effects were observed after the administration of products containing MSCs or MSC-EVs. The results indicate the safety and regenerative activity of MSCs on injured tissues, which favors not only the healing and improvement of bone structure but also the formation of hyaline cartilage. Superior tissue repair was observed after the administration of products containing AT-MSCs.

Native Italian breeds present unique traits influenced by natural selection, such as adaptation to harsh climates, or hoof strength, but face challenges due to population declines and the reduction of their original breeding purpose. This study focuses on five local Italian breeds: Bardigiano, Haflinger, Maremmano, Murgese, and Italian Heavy Draught Horse, to understand how selection has shaped their populations. A total of 1620 individuals were genotyped with a medium-density SNP chip and remapped to EquCab3. After quality control, where data were filtered based on missing genotypes per SNP (> 0.10) and missing SNPs per sample (> 0.10), 1498 horses and 54,825 SNPs remained for analysis. Population structure and runs of homozygosity (ROH) were identified, and genomic inbreeding coefficients were calculated based on ROH coverage of autosomal SNPs. ROH islands shared by ≥ 70% of horses were identified as selection signatures, and candidate genes within these regions were annotated. The inbreeding coefficient (FROH) ranged from 0.15 to 0.23, with Bardigiano and Haflinger showing the highest values probably due to selective breeding, while Maremmano, Murgese, and Italian Heavy Draught Horse displayed lower FROH, reflecting a broader diversity. ROH islands were identified on 12 chromosomes, with 23 islands distributed among breeds. Cold-blooded breeds (Bardigiano, Haflinger, and Italian Heavy Draught Horse) showed the majority, particularly on Equine Chromosome 3 (ECA3). These islands overlapped with 83 quantitative trait loci (QTLs) and 76 genes associated with morphology and health. Health-related traits such as osteochondrosis and hoof health were linked to ROH patterns, particularly in Bardigiano and Haflinger, highlighting selection for disease resistance. Signature of selections were found in the proximity of MC1R and ASIP genes likely due to their role for coat color; especially in the Haflinger and Italian Heavy Draught Horse the genotype frequency of the BIEC2_816499 SNP which is in the vicinity of the causative mutation for chestnut coat color is due to linkage disequilibrium between the two. In conclusion, this study offered valuable insights that breeders could utilize to make sound decisions. This issue would ensure the maintenance of breed genetic diversity, and the preservation and improvement of the breed's distinct traits and health standards.",,,michela.ablondi@unipr.it.

Upregulated MCL-1 in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has been demonstrated in numerous studies, and therapeutic agents targeting this protein have been assessed. However, its prognostic significance in canine HCC remains unclear. The objective of this study was to detect MCL-1 protein in canine normal liver tissue and compare its expression level with that in HCC tissue using western blotting. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was used to quantify MCL-1 intensity levels in normal, non-neoplastic hepatic diseases, and HCC tissues, and the differences were assessed. Additionally, the relevance of MCL-1 immunostaining to various clinical and pathological parameters was evaluated. MCL-1 expression was markedly elevated in HCC tissues relative to normal liver tissues (P = 0.029). Additionally, all 10 normal liver tissues exhibited low IHC expression, which significantly increased as the malignancy progressed (P < 0.001). In the HCC samples, high MCL-1 immunostaining was substantially correlated with metastatic status (P = 0.034) and tumor size (P = 0.046). Moreover, survival curve analysis revealed a significant relationship between upregulated MCL-1 and lower disease-free survival and overall survival rate (P = 0.006 and P = 0.031, respectively). MCL-1 expression is increased in canine HCC, and its overexpression significantly correlates to worse clinical outcomes.

However, studies on MES enzymes in tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) are limited. This study systematically identified MES genes in tomatoes for the first time and studied their physicochemical properties, evolutionary relationships, and expression patterns. Sixteen Solanum lycopersicum methylesterase (SlMES) genes were identified through comprehensive bioinformatics analysis and were categorized into three subfamilies. Members of the same subfamily exhibited similar gene structures, structural domains, and conserved motifs. Chromosomal analysis revealed an uneven distribution of SlMESs across the five chromosomes, with evidence of gene duplication. Cis-acting element analyses suggested that the SlMES family may have important regulatory functions in tomato growth, development, and stress responses. Among them, Solyc02g065260 was further examined for its role in tomato fruit ripening and stress responses. Its tissue-specific expression patterns, dynamic expression during fruit ripening, and responses to pathogens, low temperatures, and hormones, such as methyl jasmonate (MeJA), methyl salicylate (MeSA), abscisic acid (ABA), and ethylene (ET), were analyzed.

Recent research has illuminated the crucial role of the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in the central nervous system (CNS), highlighting its impact on neurogenesis, synaptic plasticity, and neuronal survival. Dysregulation of the BDNF signaling axis, particularly the imbalance between its precursor form and mature BDNF, is strongly implicated in the pathophysiology of AD. This review explores the molecular mechanisms through which BDNF modulates AD neuropathology and presents novel therapeutic strategies to activate BDNF signaling. We focus on the potential of BDNF activators, such as TrkB agonists and mimetic molecules, to restore synaptic function and ameliorate cognitive deficits in AD. Furthermore, we examine the challenges in translating these findings into clinical practice, including issues with blood-brain barrier penetration and the need for precise receptor targeting. The review emphasizes the therapeutic potential of repurposed drugs, including statins and metformin, in enhancing BDNF signaling and offers new insights into the future of AD treatment. Ultimately, this work provides a compelling argument for BDNF-based therapies as a promising avenue for mitigating the cognitive decline associated with Alzheimer's disease, signaling a hopeful direction for future research and clinical trials.",,,drmariospapadakis@gmail.com.

Previous work with clonal P. falciparum populations revealed var gene expression profiles inconsistent with uniform single var gene expression. However, the mechanisms underpinning this and how it might contribute to chronic infections were unclear. Here, using single-cell transcriptomics employing enrichment probes and a portable microwell system, we analysed var gene expression in clonal 3D7 and IT4 parasite lines. We show that in addition to mono-allelic var gene expression, individual parasites can simultaneously express multiple var genes or enter a state in which little or no var gene expression is detectable. Reduced var gene expression resulted in greatly decreased antibody recognition of infected cells. This transcriptional flexibility provides parasites with greater adaptive capacity and could explain the antigenically 'invisible' parasites observed in chronic asymptomatic infections.",,,kwd2001@med.cornell.edu.

Combating the pandemic has involved developing and approving vaccines and antiviral products. Camostat Mesylate (Camo) is a TMPRSS2 inhibitor that inhibits virus-cell membrane fusion and, thereby, viral multiplication. Significant limitations of using oral Camo include the limited amount of Camo reaching the site of action, lungs, side effects due to distribution to all tissues, and enzymatic breakdown in the gut. This investigation aims to develop self-administrable and patient-compliant extended-release Camo-loaded pegylated nanoliposomes (Camo-pegNLs) for delivering Camo directly to the lungs, thereby enabling faster onset of action and overcoming limitations of oral Camo delivery. We developed the Camo-pegNLs were composed of 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycerol- 3-phosphocholine (DPPC), 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycerol- 3-phosphoethanolamine (DOPE-PEG, MW2000) and cholesterol using the ethanol injection technique and syringe pump. The NLs were characterized for their particle size, polydispersity index (PDI), and zeta potential using Malvern Zetasizer.

The causes of AD are aging, environmental toxins, and cardiometabolic factors that induce the degeneration of cholinergic neurons. It has been shown that the metabolic syndrome which is a clustering of dissimilar constituents including insulin resistance (IR), glucose intolerance, visceral obesity, hypertension, and dyslipidemia is implicated in the pathogenesis of AD. Metabolic syndrome disapprovingly affects cognitive function and the development in AD by inducing the development of oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, and brain IR. These changes, together with brain IR, impair cerebrovascular reactivity causing cognitive impairment and dementia. Nevertheless, the fundamental mechanism by which metabolic syndrome persuades AD risk is not entirely explicated. Accordingly, this review aims to discuss the connotation between metabolic syndrome and AD. In conclusion, metabolic syndrome is regarded as a possible risk factor for the initiation of AD neuropathology by diverse signaling pathways such as brain IR, activation of inflammatory signaling pathways, neuroinflammation, defective proteostasis, and dysregulation of lipid mediators.",,,drmariospapadakis@gmail.com.
40379732,Comparison of RNA- and DNA-based 16S amplicon sequencing to find the optimal approach for the analysis of the uterine microbiome.,2025-05-16,Scientific reports,10.1038/s41598-025-00969-5,"Studies in humans and large animals indicate a relationship between the uterine microbiome composition and endometrial receptivity. Despite many studies have been performed, the analysis of the uterine microbiome remains challenging due to the very low microbial biomass. Studies in other biological systems showed that RNA-based microbiome analysis complements DNA-based results and provides information about active bacteria in a sample. Thus, the aim of this study was to establish a highly sensitive and specific 16S rRNA gene V3-V4 amplicon PCR from equine uterine cytobrush samples and to compare DNA- and RNA-based 16S rRNA microbiome analysis. An optimized 16S rRNA gene V3-V4 amplicon PCR protocol from equine uterine cytobrush samples was developed, which was able to detect less than 38 bacterial genome copies using a bacterial DNA community standard. For the RNA-based amplicon generation protocol starting from cDNA, at least a 10-fold higher sensitivity was estimated compared to DNA-based approach. The comparison of using RNA and DNA isolated from the same uterine cytobrush samples as input for 16S V3-V4 amplicon sequencing revealed a much higher number of amplicon sequence variants as well as taxonomic units for the RNA-based approach. This resulted in significant differences in alpha (Simpson, Chao1) and beta diversity between RNA- and DNA-based analysis. Differential abundance analysis revealed significant differences between DNA and RNA samples at all taxonomic levels. Despite these differences, the overall microbiome composition was similar between the paired DNA and RNA samples. Many differences were probably found due to the higher sensitivity of the RNA-based approach. Furthermore, the DNA-based analysis is biased by the rRNA gene copy numbers (1-21), and the RNA-based analysis by the number of ribosomes per cell, which was reflected in the differences in the microbiome composition between the approaches. In addition, the results suggested that the DNA-based analysis is detecting cell-free bacterial DNA and/or DNA of dead bacteria that could be present in the samples. Altogether, the obtained results indicate advantages of a combined DNA- and RNA-based microbiome analysis, offering complementary and valuable information in the context of fertility-related studies of the uterine microbiome.",,,antoniaisabelle.dyroff@uzh.ch.

Intestinal stem cells (ISCs) have been demonstrated as the cells of origin for tumorigenesis in the gut. However, the impact of hyperlipidemia on ISC homeostasis remains unclear. Here, we show that hyperlipidemia induced by low-density lipoprotein receptor (Ldlr) deficiency enhances ISC proliferation in vivo. Additionally, LDL treatment impairs organoid survival but increases ISC stemness ex vivo, as evidenced by the formation of poorly differentiated spheroid and higher ISC self-renewal capacity. Mechanistically, LDL treatment activates PPAR pathways, and pharmacological inhibition of PPAR and its downstream targets, including CPT1A and PDK4, mitigates the effect of LDL on ISCs. These findings demonstrate that hyperlipidemia modulates ISC homeostasis, providing new insights into the mechanism linking hyperlipidemia with tumorigenesis in the gut.",,,bowang@illinois.edu.

Numerous studies have demonstrated the considerable efficacy of natural medicines in treating and preventing DON-induced damage. Therefore, it is crucial to predict and screen highly efficient natural medicines and further investigate their mechanisms. In this study, we employed bioinformatics approaches to explore DON's pathogenic mechanism and targets. Utilizing drug prediction and screening databases, we conducted reverse prediction and screening of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and key targets to obtain optimal natural medicines, ultimately identifying quercetin as the most promising candidate. Subsequently, network pharmacology analyses revealed that quercetin alleviated DON-induced intestinal damage by modulating inflammatory targets and the TNF/NF-κB pathways. Our experiments demonstrated that quercetin treatment improved DON-induced growth inhibition and intestinal damage in mice, while successfully reversing the abnormal expression of key target genes. Furthermore, quercetin restored the intestinal microbial imbalance induced by DON. Overall, these findings suggest that quercetin is a promising natural medicine capable of alleviating DON-induced intestinal dysfunction by regulating inflammation-related factor levels and gut microbiota, thereby providing new insights for the future prevention and treatment of mycotoxins.",,,sunzilong2000@outlook.com.

However, Drosophila melanogaster uses PP2A to mitigate effects of α-amanitin. Our objectives were to test the hypothesis that modulation of PP2A protects mammals against deleterious effects of α-amanitin. In in vitro experiments, α-amanitin significantly suppressed both gene and protein expression of PP2A. Inhibiting PP2A promoted apoptosis induced by α-amanitin while suppressing autophagy. In vivo α-amanitin increased liver coefficient and AST/ALT indexes, plus caused pathological changes, ultrastructural alterations, TUNEL-positive cells, and Cleaved-caspase-3 expression. Inhibiting PP2A activity worsened these end points, but increasing PP2A activity lessened them. Furthermore, α-amanitin reduced feed intake and body weight while increasing health scores and causing concentration-dependent mortality in mice. In contrast, enhancing PP2A significantly mitigated α-amanitin-induced effects on health with 100% survival.

Polymorphisms of NOD2 confer risk for Crohn's disease (CD) and associate with small intestinal disease location. We previously showed in mice that Nod2 deficiency leads to overexpansion of Phocaeicola vulgatus in the gut and downstream goblet cell defects, which preceded small intestinal inflammation. In this study, we ask whether goblet cell defects occur in CD patients with NOD2 polymorphisms and investigate in mice how P. vulgatus signals through the intestinal epithelium. We performed a retrospective study of patients with CD to assess clinical outcomes and goblet cell histology by NOD2 status. We evaluated the contribution of microbiota and MyD88 signaling in the intestinal epithelium to goblet cell defects in the setting of Nod2 deficiency using genetic mouse models and germ-free mice. In patients with CD who have undergone ileocolic resection, NOD2 risk alleles confer a risk for re-operation (OR 8.12, P = .047) and for increased pERK and goblet cell defects in uninflamed ileal tissue. We show that patients with CD with ileal involvement harbor P. vulgatus regardless of NOD2 risk allele status. We show that intestinal epithelial MyD88 and TLR4 are required for goblet cell defects in Nod2 Goblet cell defects may be a harbinger of small intestinal inflammation in CD patients, particularly in the postoperative setting.

Lycopene (LYC) has demonstrated effectiveness in inhibiting inflammatory and oxidative stress markers and appears to exert a modulatory impact on several physiological pathways, behavioral manifestations, and cognitive symptoms associated with AD in animal models. In the present study, an AD model was established in male Wistar albino rats through daily oral administration of hydrated aluminum chloride (AlCl₃·6H₂O) at a dose of 75 mg/kg for six weeks. A Morris water maze (MWM) behavioral test was conducted to confirm memory impairment and cognitive deterioration in the treated rats. Animals exhibiting cognitive dysfunction were subsequently treated with LYC (5 mg/kg orally) for an additional six weeks, followed by a second MWM test before sacrifice. The findings revealed that LYC significantly enhanced performance and cognitive function in the AD model rats and markedly (p < 0.001) reduced the accumulation of amyloid β1-42, proinflammatory mediators [interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α)], malondialdehyde (MDA), and nitrite levels. Furthermore, LYC significantly (p < 0.001) decreased the acetylcholine (ACh) concentration, monoamine oxidase (MAO), creatine kinase (CK), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activites.

TcdB induces apoptosis in host cells by internalizing and utilizing its glycosyltransferase activity to modify members of the small GTPase protein family through glycosylation. The intestinal environment is critical for the colonization of C. difficile, and the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics disrupts the balance of the gut microbiota, leading to increased susceptibility of the host to C. difficile. At present, the mainstream clinical approach for treating C. difficile infection (CDI) involves antibiotic therapies such as vancomycin, which disrupt the gut microbiota and are associated with a considerable risk of infection recurrence. Therefore, there is an urgent clinical need to develop new strategies to combat CDI. Here, we have identified a natural compound, equol, which inhibits the TcdB-mediated glycosylation of Rac1 through direct interaction, thereby reducing TcdB-induced cell death. Equol functions as an inhibitor of indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO1) and tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase (TDO), effectively suppressing the conversion of tryptophan to kynurenine in the intestinal tract while preserving the integrity of the gut microbiota.

However, the application of SCNT technology faces numerous challenges, particularly the low efficiency and high abortion rates during the in vitro maturation phase. These issues lead to reduced implantation rates of cloned embryos, affecting overall reproductive efficiency. Therefore, enhancing the quality of in vitro maturation media has become an essential approach to improve in vitro production efficiency. This study aimed to investigate the effects of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) on bovine oocyte maturation and cloned embryo implantation rates. We observed a significant increase in oocyte maturation rates by supplementing 25 ng/mL LIF into the maturation medium. Subsequently, we generated SCNT embryos using LIF-treated oocytes and conducted activation and culture experiments. The results indicated that LIF could enhance the differentiation capabilities of SCNT embryos and exert an anti-apoptotic effect during early embryonic development. Specifically, the supplementation of LIF not only improved the nuclear maturation rates of oocytes but also enhanced cytoplasmic maturation characteristics, such as mitochondrial membrane potential and endoplasmic reticulum distribution. Furthermore, LIF-treated oocytes exhibited higher cell numbers and lower apoptosis rates in SCNT embryos, indicating its crucial role in embryo quality control. Ultimately, we found that LIF significantly improved the implantation efficiency of cloned embryos, particularly during the early stages of pregnancy following embryo transfer.

In the present study, we focused on two representative cetaceans of the Korean Sea: the narrow-ridged finless porpoise (Neophocaena asiaeorientalis sunameri) and oceanic dolphins (Family Delphinidae). When selecting polymerase chain reaction primers, mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) of N. asiaeorientalis and microsatellite Slo4 of oceanic dolphins were identified as the most effective gene sequences in high abundance in low concentration eDNA samples, using tissue samples for eDNA detection of the target species. A total of 139 samples were collected, and eDNA was detected from finless porpoises (Neophocaena sp.) in 94 samples (68%) and from oceanic dolphins in 50 samples (36%). Significantly, eDNA revealed the considerable presence of finless porpoise around Jeju Island, despite a lack of visual confirmation. In the Yellow Sea, eDNA primarily detected the presence of common dolphin (Delphinus delphis), orca (Orcinus orca), and Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops aduncus). Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphins were identified along the coast of Jeju Island. The value of this research lies in being the first attempt to explore cetacean eDNA across various species in Korea.

The results revealed that sheep are susceptible to JEV infection and develop viremia, with levels and duration comparable to those observed in pigs, a known JEV-amplifying host. Mosquitoes fed viremic sheep blood showed an infection rate of 40.6 to 57.1%. These findings indicate that sheep can serve as amplifying hosts for JEV, potentially contributing to JEV transmission and increasing the public health risk of human infections.

Herein, the potential of dietary Egyptian mallow (Malva parviflora) leaves (EML) as a powder form to mitigate the toxicological implications of metiram (MET) exposure in Oreochromis niloticus (Nile tilapia) was assessed in this attempt. The investigation featured growth, physiological, immune/antioxidant responses, splenic cytokines expression, and histopathological concepts. In light of this, fish (N = 200; 32.80 ± 0.92 g) were eventually assigned into four groups with five sets (control, EML, MET, and EML + MET) for 63 days. The control and EML groups were given basal diets that had 0 and 15 g EML/kg diet, respectively, without MET exposure. Furthermore, MET and EML + MET groups were received the identical diets as control and EML groups, respectively, and exposed to 0.38 mg/L MET. The findings highlighted a significant (P < 0.001) growth retardation (declining in weight gain and specific growth rate) and higher fish mortality (32%) by MET exposure. Also, immune impairment (lowered immunoglobulin M and complement 3) and oxidative damage (higher malondialdehyde and declined catalase and superoxide dismutase) were the outcomes of MET toxicity. In addition, the biochemical biomarkers showed substantial disruptions (P < 0.001) in the MET group, where creatinine, aspartate aminotransferase, and alanine aminotransferase increased. Splenic expression of immune-relevant cytokines (interleukin-10 and interferon-gamma 1) was downregulated with upregulation of apoptosis (cysteine-aspartic acid protease-3) linked gene by MET toxicity (P < 0.001). Histologically, MET significantly provoked a diverse range of aberrations in the spleen, kidney, and liver tissues. Remarkably, feeding the EML diet to the MET group decreased fish mortality (14%) and refined all metrics, while retaining the histological integrity of tissues. The conclusion of this viewpoint recommends using dietary EML (15 g/kg) to diminish the deleterious effects of MET in toxicity in Nile tilapia to sustain aquaculture.",,,Shaalan@savba.sk.

We report on a pediatric patient with a de novo heterozygous missense mutation R24W in USP5 who exhibits pain insensitivity. We created a CRISPR knock-in mouse harboring this mutation and performed detailed behavioral analyses in acute and chronic pain models. Heterozygous R24W mice of both sexes are resistant to acute pain and to thermal hypersensitivity in chronic inflammatory and neuropathic pain models. In contrast, only male R24W mice confer resistance to development of mechanical hypersensitivity. R24W mice lack upregulation of Cav3.2 and USP5 that is normally observed with CFA-induced inflammation. Moreover, mutant USP5 exhibits a dramatic reduction in enzymatic activity but stronger interactions with Cav3.2. Hence, R24W mutant USP5 is a critical regulator of chronic and acute pain states in humans by acting as a dominant-negative regulator of Cav3.2. Our data validate USP5 as a potential therapeutic target for chronic pain in humans.",,,

We are developing a novel anticancer agent, NEO212, a conjugate of two cancer drugs, the alkylating agent temozolomide (TMZ) and the monoterpene perillyl alcohol (POH). NEO212 has revealed robust therapeutic activity in preclinical tumour models harbouring different human cancer types. In the comparative preclinical study presented here, a two-species (canine and human) and two-cancer (leukaemia and lymphoma) analysis was performed to determine whether the promising therapeutic activity of NEO212 would span species and cancer types. We investigated the activity of NEO212 in human and canine leukaemia and lymphoma cell lines in vitro and in corresponding mouse models in vivo. Our results show that in vitro NEO212 is significantly more potent than TMZ and POH in all cell lines and exerts activity even against strongly TMZ-resistant tumour cells. In vivo, oral NEO212 strikingly extends the survival of mice harbouring human or canine leukaemia or lymphoma cells. At the same time, NEO212 is well tolerated in dogs at dosages higher than those that achieved therapeutic activity in mouse models.

We present two hybrid materials, a light stimuli-responsive polymer-based resin and a biocompatible porcine-derived decellularized extracellular matrix (dECM)-based bioresin, thus expanding the library of materials suitable for VBP. Plasmonic nanoparticles are combined with a thermoresponsive polymeric matrix, formulating the stimuli-responsive plasmonic resin, while a dECM-based bioresin with embedded smooth muscle cells (SMCs) is employed to include the biological component in the system. As proof of concept to demonstrate the versatility of the hybrid materials, we investigated the generation of highly complex structures, including multiwalled channels, using sequential VBP. Overall, this study broadens the range of materials compatible with VBP, thereby enabling the use of smart multicomponent materials in the fabrication of dynamic, stimuli-responsive 3D in vitro models.",Aizarna-Lopetegui U; Herrero-Ruiz A; Henriksen-Lacey M; Jimenez de Aberasturi D,CIC biomaGUNE,

This study aimed to investigate the expression of neuronal, synaptic, and glial markers in the retina of Spermophilus xanthoprymnus during pre-hibernation and hibernation periods using immunohistochemical staining. Synaptophysin expression, restricted to the inner plexiform layer (IPL) and outer plexiform layer (OPL) during pre-hibernation, significantly increased in both layers during hibernation, with additional expression observed in the outer nuclear layer. NeuN immunoreactivity remained unchanged in the ganglion cell layer (GCL) but increased notably in the INL during hibernation. Calbindin-D28k expression, prominent in the INL and plexiform layers during pre-hibernation, decreased markedly in hibernation. In contrast, parvalbumin expression increased across all retinal layers, except the photoreceptor layer, during hibernation. Glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) expression, observed in the NFL and GCL, was significantly reduced during hibernation. Iba-1 immunoreactivity, sparse in the IPL and OPL during pre-hibernation, showed a pronounced increase in the IPL, OPL, and INL during hibernation periods. In conclusion, the expression of synaptophysin, NeuN, calbindin-D28k, parvalbumin, GFAP, and Iba-1 was investigated for the first time in the retina of the Anatolian ground squirrel during pre-hibernation and hibernation.

Occupational and environmental exposure to vanadium is connected to a neurological syndrome that includes psychiatric symptoms, cognitive decline, and neurodegeneration. In this study, we hypothesized that prolonged vanadium exposure may be a potential risk factor for Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. A total of 72 male BALB/c mice, each 4 weeks' old, were used. Vanadium-treated groups received intraperitoneal injections of 3 mg/kg body weight of vanadium three times a week for 6, 12, or 18 months. The control group received sterile water while the withdrawal group were given vanadium injection for 3 months, followed by withdrawal of the metal, but treatment with sterile water only, and were sacrificed at 3-, 9-, or 15-months post vanadium exposure. Sagittal sections of brain paraffin-embedded tissue were prepared and analyzed using immunofluorescence to study the immunoreactivity and cellular localization of α-synuclein (α-syn), amyloid-β (Aβ), and tau proteins. Our findings revealed pathological aggregation of these proteins in the frontoparietal cortices and the dorsal CA1 and CA3 regions. Double immunolabeling with glial cells and neurons showed neuronal degeneration, functional gliosis, and activation of astrocytes and microglia at sites of α-synuclein immunoreactivity. We observed increased immunoreactivity of phosphorylated nuclei tau both in the parietal cortices and corpus callosum white matter while we observed intraneuronal accumulation of Aβ deposits in the cortex and dorsal hippocampal regions in vanadium treated brains. These cellular changes and proteinopathies, although persisting, were significantly attenuated after vanadium withdrawal. Our findings show that prolonged vanadium exposure promotes abnormal accumulation of neurodegeneration-associated proteins (α-syn, Tau, and Aβ) in the brain, which is further exacerbated by aging in the context of extended exposure to the metal.",,,
40377005,Reactive Oxygen Species: From Tumorigenesis to Therapeutic Strategies in Cancer.,2025-05-16,Cancer medicine,10.1002/cam4.70947,"Reactive oxygen species (ROS), a class of highly reactive molecules, are closely linked to the pathogenesis of various cancers. While ROS primarily originate from normal cellular processes, external stimuli can also contribute to their production. Cancer cells typically exhibit elevated ROS levels due to disrupted redox homeostasis, characterized by an imbalance between antioxidant and oxidant species. ROS play a dual role in cancer biology: at moderate levels, they facilitate tumor progression by regulating oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes, inducing mutations, promoting proliferation, extracellular matrix remodeling, invasion, immune modulation, and angiogenesis. However, excessive ROS levels can cause cellular damage and initiate apoptosis, necroptosis, or ferroptosis. This review explores molecular targets involved in redox homeostasis dysregulation and examines the impact of ROS on the tumor microenvironment (TME). Literature from recent in vitro and in vivo studies was analyzed to assess how ROS modulation contributes to cancer development and therapy. Findings indicate that ROS influence cancer progression through various pathways and cellular mechanisms. Targeting ROS synthesis or enhancing ROS accumulation in tumor cells has shown promising anticancer effects. These therapeutic strategies exhibit significant potential to impair tumor growth while also interacting with elements of the TME. The ROS serve as both promoters and suppressors of cancer depending on their intracellular concentration. Their complex role offers valuable opportunities for targeted cancer therapies. While challenges remain in precisely modulating ROS for therapeutic benefit, they hold promise as synergistic agents alongside conventional treatments, opening new avenues in cancer management.",,,

Results of toxicology studies on EB were used to evaluate estrogen, androgen, thyroid, and steroidogenic (EATS) endpoints by a Weight of Evidence (WoE) methodology, as required by U.S. EPA and OECD guidelines for evaluating a chemical's endocrine disruptive potential. The WoE method involved problem formulation, systematic literature search and selection, data quality evaluation, relevance weighting of endpoint data, and application of specific interpretive criteria. Data on EB were sufficient to assess its effects on endpoints that would be expected to respond to chemicals that operate via EATS modes of action (MoAs) in various screening assays (Tier 1) and toxicity tests (Tier 2) that evaluate reproduction, development, and sub-chronic and chronic toxicity. In those studies, EB produced a pattern of responses inconsistent with the responses that would be expected for hormones and chemicals known to operate via EATS MoAs. Endocrine-sensitive endpoints that respond to EB administration generally do so only at dose levels above its kinetic maximum dose, indicating a lack of relevance to potential effects at lower dose levels in either the test species or humans. This comprehensive WoE evaluation demonstrates that EB lacks the potential to exhibit endocrine disruptive properties and cannot be deemed an endocrine disruptor or potential endocrine disruptor. Because this WoE evaluation was based largely on Tier 2-level studies of the type considered by the U.S. EPA and OECD to be more definitive than results of Tier 1 EDSP screening results, no additional useful information would be obtained by subjecting EB to further endocrine screening. As such, further endocrine screening of EB would be unjustified from animal welfare perspectives. This analysis supports a regulatory decision to halt further testing of EB for endocrine disruption unless unique and compelling data to the contrary arise.

The effectiveness of HES compared to plasma has not been reported in calves and goats. Hetastarch increases COP to levels similar to FFP. There will be no significant adverse clinicopathological changes after administration of HES. Seven healthy preweaned calves and 7 juvenile goats from university herds. Cohort, clinical trial in a two-way crossover design. Hetastarch and FFP were administered intravenously at 10 and 20 mL/kg, respectively, once. Plasma COP was measured re-transfusion, at 0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 12, 24, 36, 72 h, and 7 days after each transfusion. Coagulation variables were analyzed pre-transfusion, at 0, 24, and 72 h after transfusion. The effects of treatment and time on COP and coagulation variables were determined by multivariate analysis of variance. Transfusion with FFP and HES increased the COP in calves and goats, with FFP increasing the COP to a greater magnitude in calves (least square mean difference of 1.6 vs. 1 mmHg; p = 0.03) but not in goats (least square mean difference of 3.0 vs. 3.0 mmHg; p = 0.99).

To describe PoC in dogs evaluated in an academic practice. Dogs with confirmed (n = 59) or presumptive (n = 53) PoC were evaluated between January 2004 and October 2020. For this retrospective study, medical records were searched for PoC. The most common presenting signs of 112 dogs with PoC were hematuria (n = 42; 38%), stranguria (n = 28; 25%), and pollakiuria (n = 25; 22%). Polyps were found incidentally (n = 13; 12%).

To assess the feasibility of NIR vessel finding technology at vascular sites in a cohort of dogs, between shaved and unshaved fur, and under conditions of vasoconstriction. 6 healthy, adult dogs (three beagles, three hounds) in a university teaching colony. 5 peripheral vascular sites were imaged before and after shaving. Images were scored based on the following criteria: not feasible (0), feasible (1), helpful but not feasible as sole guidance (2). Each vascular site was re-imaged after intravenous administration of dexmedetomidine. The left medial saphenous, right cephalic, and right lateral saphenous veins were the most feasibly identified vessels (18/18, 17/18, and 15/18, respectively).

The high frequency of viral mutations led to the emergence of resistant isolates and caused virus epidemics repeatedly, emphasizing the urgent need to develop new antivirals. Taurultam is a metabolite of taurolidine. Moreover, taurolidine has been shown to have potent antiviral activities against multiple viruses and to have antiviral effects through its metabolites. In this study, we sought to determine the antiviral activities of taurultam against SARS-CoV-2 and influenza virus in Vero-E6, Huh7, 293T-ACE2, and MDCK cell lines and mouse infection models. The results showed that taurultam exhibited potent antiviral activity against multiple SARS-CoV-2 variants, influenza A (H1N1, H3N2) virus and influenza B virus, in vitro. Moreover, in influenza A (H1N1) virus, influenza B virus and SARS-CoV-2 infection models, taurultam significantly reduced viral loads, increased survival, improved mouse body weight and lung injury. Surprisingly, taurultam treatment not only inhibited the influenza A virus and SARS-CoV-2, but also benefited for therapy of mixed infection of these two viruses in vitro, demonstrating the great antiviral potential of taurultam for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 and influenza virus infections. Together, our findings identify taurultam as a new candidate for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 and influenza virus infections, especially virus-induced lung pathology.

40375129,The whole genome analysis of the wild-type and attenuated orf virus reveals that ORF022 facilitates viral replication.,2025-05-16,BMC genomics,10.1186/s12864-025-11663-1,"Contagious ecthyma is an acute infectious zoonosis caused by orf virus (ORFV). Live-attenuated ORFV vaccines have played a crucial role in preventing contagious ecthyma for decades. However, these vaccines often fail to induce long-lasting immunity. In recent years, numerous ORFV genome sequences have been published, yet genomic data for attenuated strains remain limited. Furthermore, no comprehensive whole-genome-based single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) analysis has been conducted to compare ORFV wild-type and attenuated strains. In this study, we performed whole-genome sequencing of ORFV wild-type and attenuated strains from Shaanxi Province. We identified two ORFV strains with genomes shorter than 130 kb, which are closely related to the SC1 attenuated strain from Sichuan Province. Additionally, we noticed that 24 genes in the attenuated strain had SNPs, with the highest number of mutations occurring in the ORF022 gene. The function of the ORF022 gene has not been previously reported. Through in vitro experiments, we demonstrated that overexpression of ORF022 enhances ORFV replication in cells. The RNA-sequencing analysis revealed that ORF022 modulates host inflammation-related signaling pathways, as evidenced by the suppression of TNF, IL-17, and Toll-like receptor signaling pathways. Our findings suggest that the ORF022 in ORFV wild-type strain inhibits the host inflammatory response, reduces the immune response to ORFV, and facilitates viral replication. SNP events in attenuated strains (aFX0910) are one of the reasons for its attenuation. Investigations into the genomic sequences of attenuated viruses and the functional impact of mutated genes provide valuable insights into the mechanisms underlying ORFV attenuation and offer a foundation for the development of more effective ORFV vaccines.",,,gaoxiaolong1017@163.com.

It is caused by Cysticercus bovis (C. bovis), which is the larval stage of Taenia saginata that inhabits the small intestine of man. In the two-host life cycle, humans are the definitive hosts, and cattle are the intermediate hosts. Therefore, the current research aims to study the prevalence of C. bovis in slaughtered cattle in Aswan province, Upper Egypt, by using both macroscopic and molecular techniques. A cross-sectional study on C. Bovis in slaughtered cattle was conducted from July 2023 to April 2024 at several central slaughterhouses (Edfu, Kom Ombo, Daraw, Aswan, and Abu Simbel) in Aswan province, Egypt, to ascertain the prevalence of C. bovis in 47,763 slaughtered cattle through routine daily antemortem and postmortem inspections; histopathological inspection and molecular analysis were implemented to verify the findings. Out of 47,763 slaughtered cattle, 1,083 (2.27%) have macroscopic C. bovis cysts. The infection rates in local and imported cattle were 1.94% (203/10438) and 2.36% (880/37325), respectively. The prevalence of C. bovis infection was found to be significantly associated with the age, sex, and body condition of slaughtered cattle (p < 0.05). In the local breed, the heart had the highest occurrence of C. bovis (64%), whereas in the imported breed, the masseter muscles were the most susceptible to infection (92.00%). The histopathological analysis demonstrated that the deteriorated cysts were situated in regions of tissue coagulative necrosis, characterized by a wide range of inflammatory infiltrates and collagen fibers, particularly eosinophils and macrophages. In addition, the muscle fibers undergo degenerative changes, which may lead to the loss of normal muscle structure. The presence of the C. bovisHDP2 gene was demonstrated by the PCR analysis of C. bovis cyst samples, which showed positive diagnostic bands at 599 bp on gel electrophoresis. Based on the findings in this study, the slaughtered cattle meant for human consumption in Aswan, Egypt, had C. bovis lesions restricted to one or a few organs. The study revealed that the spread of infection in these valuable organs in cattle has negative implications for food safety. We strongly support the One Health strategy for preventing zoonotic pathogens from spreading to humans and preventing economic loss in cattle production.",,,nadykhairy@vet.aswu.edu.eg.

However, the effects of β-lactam antibiotics on conjugation transfer of IncI2 plasmids and the homeostasis of the mouse intestinal microbiota have not been thoroughly investigated. The results revealed that the transfer of IncI2 plasmid was the highest for intra-specific E. coli and inter-specific transfer to Salmonella and K. pneumoniae occurred at much lower levels in the absence of β-lactam antibiotic selective pressure. Furthermore, inter-species and intra-species transfer of IncI2 plasmid was enhanced in the presence of sub-MIC levels of amoxicillin/clavulanate and cephalexin whereas ampicillin promoted only inter-species transfer. These results were consistent with in vivo observations where amoxicillin/clavulanate and cephalexin but not ampicillin promoted conjugation. Meanwhile, the intestinal microbiota was also disturbed following antibiotic treatment and Proteobacteria abundance increased while Bacteroides decreased. The gut microbiota could also be partially restored to initial levels after antibiotic cessation for 14 days. These findings highlight the potential risk of β-lactam antibiotics in promoting the spread of resistance plasmids and causing disruption to the intestinal microbiota.",,,xpliao@scau.edu.cn.

While a prevalent method for preserving rabbit semen, cryopreservation can elicit cold shock and other stressors, resulting in a decline in sperm quality. Thereafter, the researchers hypothesized that BG, potentially due to its antioxidant properties, could mitigate these detrimental effects. For the experiment, semen samples were diluted in extender and assigned to treatment groups receiving BG at concentrations of 0 (BG0), 100 (BG100), 200 (BG200), or 400 (BG400) µL/mL, followed by storage at 4 °C. Sperm quality parameters (motility, viability, membrane integrity, and morphology) were assessed at 24-, 48-, and 72-hour time points of storage. Results indicated a quadratic improvement in sperm motility, viability, and membrane integrity with the addition of 100 or 200 µL/mL of BG across all time points (P < 0.01). A quadratic relationship was observed between BG supplementation levels and the concentrations of GPx and SOD, indicating a dose-dependent increase. BG treatment at all concentrations led to elevated total antioxidant capacity (TAC) compared to the control, with peak TAC values at 200 and 400 µL/mL BG. Conversely, nitric oxide (NO) levels significantly decreased (P < 0.001) with increasing BG dosage. BG treatment significantly decreased malondialdehyde, H₂O₂, and protein carbonyl levels compared to the control (P < 0.01). Additionally, succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) and malate dehydrogenase (MDH) activities were significantly and quadratically improved at BG concentrations of 200 and 400 µL/mL relative to the 100 µL/mL concentration. In conclusion, supplementing rabbit semen extenders with BG significantly enhanced sperm quality during 72-hour chilled storage by attenuating oxidative stress, bolstering antioxidant capacity, and promoting mitochondrial enzyme activity. These findings suggest that BG is a promising additive for improving the preservation of chilled rabbit semen, potentially benefiting artificial insemination and rabbit breeding programs.",,,Samehtimor86@gmail.com.

Specimens were dissected, and openings were created in the ventral and dorsal nasal conchae for the introduction of radiopaque material. The new radiographic projection was named lateral 75° dorsal-lateral ventral oblique view. This projection was obtained with the mandibular rami resting on the imaging plate and the mandible displaced toward the side of interest (partial excursion). The X-ray beam was directed dorsoventrally, slightly angled toward the side of interest (left or right offset mandible dorsoventral view), and centered at an imaginary line connecting the tips of the facial crests. The lateral 75° dorsal-lateral ventral oblique view provided enhanced visualization and allowed correct identification of equine conchal structures. Lateral displacement of the mandible and the 75° angle of inclination to the vertical plane eliminated the superimposition of anatomical structures, facilitating radiographic image interpretation and increasing diagnostic accuracy.

Cerebral vasospasm, a common complication of SAH, is a leading cause of delayed ischemic injury. Oxidative stress and inflammation are central to the pathophysiology of vasospasm. Vitamin B12, a water-soluble vitamin with antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, has shown potential neuroprotective effects in experimental models. This study aimed to investigate the effects of vitamin B12 on vascular changes, oxidative stress, and inflammatory markers in an experimental rat model of SAH. Eighteen Sprague Dawley rats were divided into three groups: a control group, an SAH group, and an SAH + B12 group. SAH was induced by injecting autologous blood into the cisterna magna. The SAH + B12 group received intraperitoneal B12 (15 mcg/kg) at 1 and 24 h post-SAH. Biochemical parameters, including total oxidant status (TOS), total antioxidant status (TAS), oxidative stress index (OSI), and inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α), were analyzed. Histopathological evaluation of the basilar artery was performed, measuring arterial diameter and wall thickness. The SAH group exhibited significant elevations in TOS, OSI, IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α levels, along with decreased TAS, indicating heightened oxidative stress and inflammation. The SAH + B12 group showed significant reductions in TOS, OSI, and inflammatory cytokines compared to the SAH group (p < 0.05), alongside improved TAS levels. Histopathological findings demonstrated reduced arterial wall thickening and preserved lumen diameter in the SAH + B12 group compared to the untreated SAH group. Although the differences in arterial diameter and wall thickness were not statistically significant, the findings suggest that B12 may mitigate SAH-induced vascular injury by reducing oxidative stress and inflammation. These results highlight B12's potential as a therapeutic agent for SAH-related vasospasm. Further studies are needed to validate these findings in larger populations and clinical settings.",,,opdrmuratyucel@gmail.com.

However, the signalling pathways that drive these adaptations are not well understood. Here we identify phosphorylation events that are differentially regulated by endurance and resistance exercise. Using a model of unilateral exercise in male participants and deep phosphoproteomic analyses, we find that a prolonged activation of a signalling pathway involving MKK3b/6, p38, MK2 and mTORC1 occurs specifically in response to resistance exercise. Follow-up studies in both male and female participants reveal that the resistance-exercise-induced activation of MKK3b is highly correlated with the induction of protein synthesis (R = 0.87). Additionally, we show that in mice, genetic activation of MKK3b is sufficient to induce signalling through p38, MK2 and mTORC1, along with an increase in protein synthesis and muscle fibre size. Overall, we identify core components of a signalling pathway that drives the growth-promoting effects of resistance exercise.",,,troy.hornberger@wisc.edu.

In mice, M1AP interacts with the ZZS proteins SHOC1/TEX11/SPO16, promoting DNA class I crossover formation during meiosis. To determine whether M1AP and ZZS proteins are involved in human male infertility by recombination failure, we screened for biallelic/hemizygous loss-of-function (LoF) variants in the human genes to select men with presumed protein deficiency (N = 24). After in-depth characterisation of testicular phenotypes, we identified gene-specific meiotic impairments: men with ZZS deficiency shared an early meiotic arrest. Men with LoF variants in M1AP exhibited a predominant metaphase I arrest with rare haploid round or even elongated spermatids. These differences were explained by different recombination failures: deficient ZZS function led to incorrect synapsis of homologous chromosomes, unrepaired DNA double-strand breaks, and incomplete recombination. Abolished M1AP led to a reduced number of recombination intermediates and class I crossover. Medically assisted reproduction resulted in the birth of a healthy child, offering the possibility of fatherhood to men with LoF variants in M1AP.

Animal,10.1007/s11626-025-01043-0,"In the central nervous system (CNS), cystathionine β-synthase (CBS) is localized in astrocytes. CBS degrades cytotoxic homocysteine and produces cytoprotective hydrogen sulfide; thus the proper expression of CBS is required to maintain CNS functions. CBS expression is very low at the late embryonic stage and increases after birth. This study examined CBS expression in cultured spinal cord cells derived from fetal rats. Treatment of spinal cord cells with epidermal growth factor (EGF) promoted the proliferation and maturation of astrocytes during development. EGF (30 ng/ml, 4 days) increased CBS protein expression and the number of CBS-expressing astrocytes in the culture. A high cell density also increased CBS expression, and EGF was able to increase CBS expression when cellular proliferation was inhibited.

This study investigated the diversity of gastrointestinal parasites in great cormorants from the Republic of Korea using 18S rRNA gene metabarcoding and conventional diagnostic methods. Fecal samples were collected from 10 great cormorants in Korea, and DNA was extracted for metabarcoding targeting the V4 and V9 regions of the 18S rRNA gene using the MiSeq platform. Conventional PCR and microscopic examination were used for validation. The V4 region of the 18S rRNA gene revealed the presence of Baruscapillaria spiculata, Contracaecum sp., and Isospora lugensae. The V9 region analysis identified the following parasites: Tetratrichomonas sp., Histomonas meleagridis, Trichomitus sp., Tetratrichomonas prowazekii, B. obsignata, Monosiga ovata, and Fasciola gigantica. Furthermore, conventional PCR confirmed the presence of Contracaecum sp., Isospora sp., and unspecified trichomonads, and microscopic examination identified eggs of capillarid, Contracaecum, and Eustrongylides and trophozoites of flagellated protozoa in the collected cormorant fecal samples. The findings underscored the potential ecological role of great cormorants as hosts for diverse gastrointestinal parasites and the utility of 18S rRNA gene metabarcoding for screening the diversity of gastrointestinal parasites in great cormorants.",,,parasite@chungbuk.ac.kr.

In rats, predator odor (""traumatic"") stress produces persistent avoidance of stress-paired contexts and escalated alcohol self-administration in some animals (Avoiders) but not others (Non-Avoiders), mirroring the individual differences in stress responsivity and alcohol misuse seen in humans. Here, we measured post-stress free-choice and aversion-resistant alcohol drinking, anxiety-related behavior, and lateral hypothalamus Crh, Crhr1, Crhr2, and Crhbp gene expression in male and female Avoiders, Non-Avoiders, and unstressed Controls. Male but not female Avoider rats escalated their free-choice alcohol intake after stress, and greater avoidance predicted greater aversion-resistant alcohol drinking. Using ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs) as a measure of affect, we found that Non-Avoider males emitted more low frequency USVs (<32 kHz) preceding, during, and following predator odor stress. Finally, quantification of Crh, Crhr1, Crhr2, and Crhbp gene expression in the LH revealed that male Avoider rats had elevated Crh expression than Non-Avoiders and Controls, and that greater LH Crh expression correlated with more avoidance behavior and more alcohol drinking. In females, greater expression of Crh, Crhr1, Crhr2, and Crhbp in the LH all predicted less anxiety-like behavior. Collectively, these results show that the relationship between stress, alcohol drinking, anxiety-like behavior, and the LH CRH system is sex- and subpopulation-specific.",,,marcus.weera@tufts.edu.

This retrospective study aimed to assess and classify the types of TR in small-breed dogs and investigate associations between TR and factors such as sex, skull type, body weight, number of missing teeth, TR type, breed, and age. Dental radiographs of 248 dogs weighing less than 15 kg, examined over a three-year period, were included in this study. Statistical analyses were performed to investigate the associations between the examined variables and TR. The most common type of resorption was external replacement resorption (ERR), followed by external inflammatory resorption (EIR). Significant associations were found among age, number of missing teeth, and total TR (p < 0.01). In addition, the prevalence of ERR and EIR increased with age (p < 0.01). The rate of TR was significantly higher in premolars than in incisors, canines, and molars (p < 0.001). Maltese dogs showed a significantly higher prevalence of TR (p < 0.05), particularly ERR (p < 0.05), than other breeds. The TR rate increased significantly in dogs aged 9-11 years, 12-15 years, and over 15 years. Given the high prevalence of TR in older small-breed dogs, particularly in premolars and breeds such as Maltese, clinicians should exercise caution during tooth extraction. Thorough radiographic evaluation is recommended to accurately assess the extent of resorption, especially in older dogs and predisposed breeds.",,,se.kim@snu.ac.kr.

Horses with NSII need surgical intervention, while idiopathic peritonitis cases can be successfully treated with antimicrobials. A correct diagnosis is thus crucial, but because the two diseases overlap in clinicopathological features, differentiation is difficult in clinical practice. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are non-coding RNAs that exhibit measurable changes in abundance in tissues and circulation during disease. This study aimed to explore differences in plasma miRNA abundance between patients with NSII and IP. Plasma samples were collected from 43 horses, consisting of 21 with NSII and 22 with IP. A subset (n=12) was submitted for deep small RNA sequencing to identify miRNAs differing between the groups. Next, a panel of nine miRNAs (two were potential normalizers) were selected for evaluation and confirmation by reverse transcription quantitative real-time PCR (RT-qPCR). Small RNA sequencing detected 628 miRNAs in the blood samples, but no miRNAs were differentially abundant between the disease groups. This finding was confirmed by qPCR. In agreement with previous studies, the top abundant miRNAs in both groups included Eca-Mir-122-5p and Eca-Mir-486-5p, as well as Eca-Mir-223-3p, which has previously been associated with inflammation. Target prediction for the most abundant miRNAs additionally predicted targets in inflammatory pathways. Evaluation of clinicopathological parameters revealed differences between the groups in two measures (white blood cell count and blood neutrophil count), which aligns with findings from previous studies.

The rats were administered IFA at a dose of 500 mg/kg body weight, followed by oral HES treatment at doses of 200 and 300 mg/kg body weight. The results demonstrated that HES significantly reduced IFA-induced increases in urea and creatinine levels, indicating improved kidney function. HES was shown to mitigate IFA-induced lipid peroxidation, likely due to its antioxidant properties, and to enhance the activities of key antioxidant enzymes, including catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and glutathione peroxidase (GPx), as well as elevate glutathione (GSH) levels. Biochemical and immunohistochemical analyses further revealed that HES exhibited anti-inflammatory, antiapoptotic and anti-endoplasmic reticulum stress effects, suppressing the elevated levels of nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-κB), interleukin-1β (IL-1β), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), Caspase-3, 6, 9, Bax, Apaf1, p53, serine/threonine-protein kinase/endoribonuclease inositol-requiring enzyme 1α (IRE1α), glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78), activating transcription factor 6 (ATF-6), and protein kinase R-like ER kinase (PERK), CHOP and alleviating level of Bcl-2 in IFA-exposed kidney tissue.

We found that the cytotoxic protein perforin was expressed in CD8 T cells only upon recruitment to Leishmania-infected skin, suggesting that lesional inflammatory cues induced perforin. Here, using a mouse model of Leishmania major infection, we demonstrated that the expression of perforin was driven by a combination of hypoxia and IL-15, both of which are microenvironmental signals present within Leishmania-infected skin. We also demonstrated that the major sources of Il15 mRNA in cutaneous leishmaniasis lesions are neutrophils and macrophages and that macrophages exposed to hypoxia in vitro produce more Il15. Since perforin is only present in lesions, we reformulated a small molecule perforin inhibitor for topical application and found that local inhibition of perforin is sufficient to ameliorate disease in established cutaneous leishmaniasis. Thus, topical perforin inhibition may be considered a therapeutic strategy for patients with cutaneous leishmaniasis and other inflammatory skin diseases where cytotoxic CD8 T cells contribute to disease pathogenesis.",Trapani JA,Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre,Fernanda.Novais@osumc.edu.

Vibrio mimicus is an epidemic pathogen that threatens aquatic animals and human health, resulting in high morbidity and mortality after infecting the fish. Currently, the role of waaC gene in V. mimicus is still unclear. In this study, waaC gene deletion and complementation strains of V. mimicus were constructed. Our results show that ΔwaaC exhibited a rough phenotype on LB agar, with elevated exocrine protein and a disordered cell wall observed by the electron microscope. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that following the deletion of waaC gene, the expression of 224 genes was drastically upregulated, while the expression of 229 genes was significantly downregulated. These genes involve various pathways, including material transport, metabolism, and environmental adaptation. The tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA cycle) and pyruvate metabolism are the primary pathways affected by waaC gene. Our phenotypic analysis is consistent with transcriptomic findings, indicating that the decreased pathogenicity of ΔwaaC is related to the effect of waaC gene on these genes, which negatively impacts V. mimicus growth, motility, adhesion, and biofilm formation while enhancing its self-aggregation. The virulence of the ΔwaaC was 103-fold lower than that of the wild strain. Moreover, the expression levels of inflammatory cytokine and pro-apoptotic genes in epithelioma papulosum cyprini (EPC) cells were dramatically upregulated during the ΔwaaC infection.

However, the mechanisms underlying age-related intestinal inflammation remain poorly described. Here, we find that the resolution of T cell-initiated intestinal inflammation is impaired with aging. This impairment is mediated by disrupting the immune-microbiota interplay, controlled by intestinal eicosanoid metabolism. Pharmacologically inhibiting eicosanoid biosynthesis, blocking the prostaglandin E receptor subtype 4 (EP4), or genetically ablating EP4 diminishes age-related impairment of intestinal inflammation resolution. Mechanistically, mononuclear phagocyte-intrinsic eicosanoid-EP4 signaling impedes the resolution of intestinal inflammation through fostering gut microbial dysbiosis and, more importantly, interrupting segmented filamentous bacterial adhesion to the intestinal epithelium. Colonization with EP4-ablated mouse microbiota or segmented filamentous bacteria improves the resolution of intestinal inflammation. These findings reveal that eicosanoid-dependent immune-microbiota interactions impair inflammation resolution in the aged intestine, highlighting potential intervention strategies for improving age-related gut health.",,,chengcan.yao@ed.ac.uk.

Detecting the impact of pollutants in wild populations can be especially challenging. Such environmental disturbances might prompt rapid responses in the affected organisms, generating changes in their gene expression mediated by epigenetic regulation. Here we use an epiRADseq approach to determine the effect of four non-essential metals (As, Cd, Hg, Pb) and microplastics (MP) on the methylation pattern of Benguela hake, Merluccius polli, captured in the FAO fishing area 34, along the coasts of Mauritania and Senegal. We analysed 49 hake specimens and generated 44,201 epigenetic loci. Despite moderate levels of pollution identified from tissue analysis, we found significant differentially methylated loci associated with the level of the five pollutants analysed (119 significant loci for As, 134 for Cd, 92 for Hg, 119 for Pb, and 159 for microplastics). Elevated Pb was significantly associated with a reduction in hake condition factor. Differentially methylated loci were associated with diverse pathways associated to responses for all pollutants (e.g. immune response, gene expression regulation), pointing to signs of stress within the population. It is worth noting that all pollutants were differentially methylated for a locus in NLRC3, previously associated with innate immune response in fishes.

Though proximity to urban development often correlates with increased exposure in non-target wildlife, outdoor use of AR products in more rural settings can also contribute to secondary exposures, though point sources are difficult to identify. For fishers (Pekania pennanti), we suspected that alternate-year pulsed resources (e.g., mast seeding), known to drive irruptions in small mammal abundance in densely forested systems, would influence AR exposure, especially where human densities are high. We further suspected AR exposure might increase over time independent of the masting and that fisher age and sex would influence AR exposure given differential patterns of space use. We quantified AR exposure in legally harvested fishers (n = 338) sampled across a gradient of forest coverage across New York State between 2018 and 2020. We detected between 1 and 5 AR compounds in 83 % of sampled fishers, with the rate of detection of at least one compound increasing by approximately 8 % per year. We modeled the total number of compounds detected and the probability of exposure to each of the three most-detected compounds as a function of fisher sex, age, and spatial covariates. Adult fishers (3-4 years-old) and males had the highest exposure. The odds of exposure to bromadiolone increased 4 % for a unit increase in the previous year beech seed production relative to the long-term mean-equal to 2.6× the long-term average, an impact that appears small relative to the high background rate of exposure owing to the apparently ubiquitous use of ARs across the landscape.

Proteins A and AG have been previously found to react strongly to the immunoglobulins of pinnipeds and cetaceans. However, the binding properties of immunoglobulins of other marine mammals remain unclear to these proteins. Using ELISA, this study further assessed the binding properties of proteins A, G, and AG in detecting immunoglobulins in marine mammals such as marine fissipeds and sirenians (grouped together ecologically but not taxonomically). Sera/plasmas from two marine fissipeds (polar bears and sea otters), one sirenian (manatees), one pinniped (grey seals), and four cetaceans (Commerson's dolphins, false killer whales, finless porpoises, and pantropical spotted dolphins) were collected. The results revealed that the immunoglobulins of these marine mammals bound more strongly to proteins A and AG than to protein G, indicating a strong signal intensity in ELISA and a strong antibody-protein complex reaction.

Overall, 1,117 girls participated, including 351 (31.4%) from public schools, 543 (48.6%) from government aided schools and 223 (20.0%) from private schools. Only 35.7% of the girls correctly identified the origin of menstruation. The main source of information on menstruation was mothers. Most girls (82.5%) used single-use sanitary pads, and a small proportion (14.6%) relied on reusable cloth pads. The most identified barriers to accessing sanitary products were financial barriers. The average cost of menstrual products per cycle varied between RWF 3,100 in private schools, to RWF 4,000/4,300 in public/government-aided schools, and were covered mainly by parents. Most schools had gender-sensitive sanitation facilities, mainly pit latrines (86.7%), but only 53.3%, 33.33% and 20% provided water, soap and MHM commodities respectively. The results underscored the need for continuous menstrual education aimed at both girls and parents, and capitalizing on low-cost initiatives that can improve access to sanitary pads and WASH/sanitary facilities in schools.",,,
40373047,Evaluation of the performance of three pulse oximeters at different probe positions in awake rabbits.,2025-05-15,PloS one,10.1371/journal.pone.0323044,"In rabbits, pulse oximetry plays a crucial role in monitoring oxygen saturation (SpO2) and pulse rate (PR), but it can be challenging due to their small size, variable anatomy, limited measurement sites, and potential motion artifacts during measurements. This prospective randomized study aimed to assess the reliability of three pulse oximeters on the forelimb and tail of fifty awake, healthy European rabbits. Two pulse oximeters, the Masimo Rad-5 (device 1) and the Edan VE-H100B, were tested, with the latter using both a Y-clip (device 2) and the Nellcor OxiMax adhesive finger sensor (device 3). Reliable values of SpO2 and PR were considered ≥ 95% and ≥ 151 bpm, respectively, which are normal values in a healthy rabbit. Success rates of the devices were calculated as the ratio of reliable to unreliable/missing values and compared using χ2 tests. Correlation and agreement between PR and clinically measured heart rate (cHR) were assessed using the Pearson correlation coefficient (r) and Bland-Altman analysis, respectively. Success rates differed significantly among devices (p < 0.001). The SpO2 success rates were 46%, 95.6%, and 94.4% for devices 1, 2, and 3, respectively. The PR success rates were 54.6%, 63%, and 72.8% for devices 1, 2, and 3, respectively. Success rates were higher on the forelimb (>66%) than on the tail (>26%) across devices. Correlation between PR and cHR was stronger on forelimb (r > 0.80) than on tail (r < 0.70). Agreement between PR and cHR was similar among devices, with a mean bias ranging from -6.6 to 6.7 bpm, and limits of agreement from -33.8 to 41.5 bpm. The Edan devices showed superior ability to detect reliable values of SpO2 and PR compared to the Masimo in rabbits. The forelimb appears to be a more reliable site for pulse oximetry in rabbits than the tail.",De Rosa V,Department of Small Animal Internal Medicine,
40372800,Tryptophan Metabolism as a Key Target in PFOS-Mediated Decline of Porcine Oocyte Quality.,,Environmental science & technology,10.1021/acs.est.5c01550,"Perfluorooctanesulfonate (PFOS) is a persistent environmental endocrine disruptor that poses severe threats to mammalian reproductive health upon accumulation in organisms. Therefore, elucidating the mechanisms of PFOS-induced damage and identifying effective protective strategies are of critical importance. In this study, an untargeted metabolomic analysis revealed that PFOS exposure significantly disrupted metabolic homeostasis in oocytes. Using public databases to predict potential target proteins of PFOS and performing KEGG pathway enrichment analysis, we identified the tryptophan metabolism pathway as a key target of PFOS. Molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations demonstrated specific binding between PFOS and proteins involved in the tryptophan metabolism pathway, leading to dynamic structural alterations in these proteins. Furthermore, supplementation with tryptophan was shown to significantly enhance mitochondrial function in oocytes, regulate the glutathione (GSH)/oxidized glutathione (GSSG) ratio, reduce reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, and alleviate oxidative stress, thereby mitigating the decline in oocyte quality caused by PFOS exposure. These findings provide novel theoretical insights and research directions for using tryptophan as a protective agent against PFOS-induced reproductive toxicity.",Cui Z; Liu P; Wang H,Institue of Animal Science,

Data from The Cancer Genome Atlas, GSE135631, and GSE214846, were utilized to evaluate changes in lncRNA expression in HCC and their associations with patient prognosis. A risk model was created based on lncRNA expression to predict patient mortality. The co-expression network was employed to identify associated pathways, and the results were subsequently validated using the RT-qPCR method. The findings indicated that 14 lncRNAs were down-regulated in HCC, and their increased expression was associated with a favorable prognosis. Additionally, eight lncRNAs were overexpressed and correlated with poorer patient outcomes. The multivariate Cox regression analysis demonstrated that overexpression of AKR1B10P1, RP11-465B22.3, WASH8P, and the downregulation of NPM1P25 could independently predict patient survival, irrespective of clinical variables. The risk score model based on these lncRNAs effectively stratified patients by their mortality risk. Furthermore, the co-expression network analysis revealed that the identified lncRNAs might be involved in various pathways, including fatty acid metabolism, mTOR signaling, glycolysis, angiogenesis, Wnt-β-catenin pathway, and DNA repair. RT-qPCR results validated the significant increase in the expression level of WASH8P in cancer specimens compared to normal tissues. Our results unveiled that changes in the expression levels of AKR1B10P1, RP11-465B22.3, WASH8P, and NPM1P25 were significantly and independently associated with prognosis. Moreover, the patient mortality risk model constructed using these four lncRNAs exhibited a robust capacity to accurately predict patients' survival rates.",,,m.gerami@iaushk.ac.ir.

A total of 120 one-day-old Ross 308 broiler chicks were randomly assigned to three experimental groups: a control group (basal diet without any supplementation), and two treatment groups with diets supplemented with 1% and 2% DPP, respectively. Growth performance was monitored weekly, and carcass attributes were measured at the end of the 42-days trial. Blood samples were collected for biochemical analysis, and cecal microbiota (total bacterial count, E. coli and salmonella) was assessed. Results indicated that DPP supplementation significantly reduced body weight, body weight gain, and feed consumption compared to the control group, particularly at 21 and 42 days. Birds fed 2% DPP showed a better feed conversion ratio (FCR) but body weight was reduced during both the starter period and overall experimental period, while those fed 1% DPP had an improved FCR only during the starter phase but showed a worsened FCR during the finisher and overall period. DPP supplementation also significantly increased the relative weights of the eviscerated carcass, liver, heart, gizzard, and spleen while reducing abdominal fat. Blood analysis revealed no significant effects on protein or liver enzymes, but DPP reduced glucose, cholesterol, HDL, and triglyceride levels. Additionally, DPP reduced the cecal counts of total bacteria, E. coli, and Salmonella. Histological analysis revealed that DPP supplementation improved bursal and ileal structures, enhancing immunity and gut health. In conclusion, DPP supplementation, particularly at 2%, improved gut health, reduced abdominal fat, and modulated microbial populations but adversely affected growth performance due to reduced feed palatability. These findings suggest that DPP may be a functional feed additive with health-promoting benefits, though further research is needed to optimize its inclusion level.",,,fawaz@agr.svu.edu.eg.

According to new challenges in studies on gustatory papillae, we adopted a modern computer-aided method of 3D reconstruction of gustatory papillae from serial 2D cross-sections in the description of the taste bud system. The study in short-hair cats aimed for the first time in carnivores to analyze fungiform (Fu papillae) and vallate papillae (Vp papillae) with spatial visualization of connective tissue cores (CTCs) and the arrangement and exact number of taste buds (Tbs). Results indicate the diversity in size and internal connective tissue microstructure of Fu and Vp papillae in short-hair cats. Four types of CTCs were distinguished in Fu papillae: mushroom-like, club-like, columnar-like, and bud-like, whereas CTC in Vp papillae was mushroom-like. The Tbs of Fu and on Vp papillae were either evenly distributed or grouped. Tbs of Fu papillae analyzed in particular parts of the tongue and on Vp papillae revealed differences in its number. The estimated total number of Tbs on the tongue was up circa 8265. Our 2D and 3D Tbs analyses highlight the functional importance of different tongue regions: the lingual apex for food preselection, the lateral lingual surfaces for analyzing chewed food, and the caudal part of the tongue for final food tasting before swallowing. Comparing our results in cats with previous studies on herbivores, we recommend using proposed 3D analyses as effective tools for further comparative studies of mammalian gustatory structures.",,,hanna.jackowiak@up.poznan.pl.

These processes are significant contributors to the pathophysiology of autism spectrum disorders, which involve neuronal dysfunction, cell loss, and behavioral impairments. Under conditions of oxidative stress, activated microglia release pro-inflammatory mediators, further intensifying neuronal damage. Bismuth subsalicylate (BSS), a compound with well-documented anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties, has shown potential in mitigating such neurodegenerative processes. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of BSS in reducing neuroinflammation and oxidative stress in a propionic acid (PPA)-induced autism model, alongside its impact on behavioral outcomes. The study utilized 30 male Wistar albino rats, with PPA administered intraperitoneally at 250 mg/kg/day for 5 days to induce an autism-like phenotype. Rats were divided into three groups: Group 1 (Normal control, n = 10); Group 2 (PPA + saline, PPAS, n = 10); and Group 3 (PPA + BSS, PPAB, n = 10). Treatments were administered for 15 days. Behavioral performance was assessed through three-chamber sociability, open field, and passive avoidance learning tests, followed by biochemical and histological evaluations of brain tissues. Biochemical analysis revealed a significant increase in malondialdehyde, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and interleukin-17 levels in the PPAS group, indicating heightened oxidative stress and inflammation. Treatment notably reduced these markers, suggesting its efficacy in mitigating oxidative damage and inflammatory responses. Immunohistochemical results demonstrated reduced glial activation and enhanced neuronal preservation in the hippocampal and cerebellar regions of treated rats. Additionally, behavioral impairments in social interaction, exploration, and memory were significantly improved with BSS therapy. These results suggest that BSS may confer neuroprotective effects through attenuation of oxidative stress and neuroinflammation, potentially contributing to improved neuronal function and behavioral performance in a PPA-induced autism model.",,,kubilay.dogan.kilic@ege.edu.tr.

Latest findings have demonstrated the inherent adjuvant capacity of some specific lipid components, especially in stimulating immune compartments, which prompted the rational use of lipid-based delivery vehicles in drug R&D. In this concise review, we summarize current knowledge on the adjuvant properties of LNP, with a particular focus on the key components that mediate such effects. Specifically, we describe the vital role of ionizable lipids in triggering innate immune activation and inflammation and highlight the importance of these lipids in determining vaccine effectiveness or safety. Furthermore, the mechanisms by which LNP enhance the immune response are discussed in detail, shedding light on their potential applications in next-generation vaccine design and development. We also present compelling pre-clinical studies that serve as strong evidence for the adjuvant properties of LNP components in enhancing vaccine immunogenicity.",,,

This study identifies six distinct neutralizing antigenic sites by evaluating 27 host-derived neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) using competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (cELISA). These sites include the VP1 G-H loop, VP1 C-terminus, site 2, site 4, site 6, and site 7. Notably, classical sites 1 and 5 were reclassified into the VP1 G-H loop and VP1 C-terminus classes. Sites 2 and 4 align with classical classifications, targeting independent epitopes on VP2 and VP3, respectively. We identified two novel sites: site 6, which involves extensive interactions with the G-H loop, C-terminus of VP1 and VP3, and site 7, which interacts with both VP2 and VP3. Sera from cattle, sheep, and pigs immunized with four serotype O lineages (O/SCGH/2016, O/Mya/98, O/Tibet/99, and O/XJ/2017) were used to evaluate the immunodominance of these sites. NAb responses favored site 4 for O/SCGH/2016 and the VP1 G-H loop for O/XJ/2017. Immunization effectiveness varied by strains and host species: O/XJ/2017 and O/Tibet/99 were effective in sheep, while O/Mya/98 showed reduced efficacy; O/Tibet/99 showed good immunogenicity in pigs. No significant differences were observed in cattle. There is a strong correlation (r = 0.8693) between NAb levels at site 6 and virus neutralization tests, suggesting its potential for use in alternative testing methods. This study describes the spatial distribution of neutralizing sites and highlights strain-specific immunodominant epitopes and differential antibody responses across species, providing valuable insights for FMD prevention and control. The antigenic structure of the foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) serotype O is complex, and the immunodominant epitopes among different lineages remain poorly understood. This study classified the capsid surface epitopes into six distinct antigenic sites utilizing 27 neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) by paired competitive ELISAs (cELISAs). High-affinity NAbs were selected for site-directed cELISAs to assess antibody abundance in serum from cattle, sheep, and pigs vaccinated with various inactivated FMDV serotype O vaccines. Additionally, liquid-phase blocking ELISA (LPBE) and virus neutralization test (VNT) were employed to measure total antibody and NAb titers. Results indicated that immunodominant sites vary among different strains, with each strain exhibiting different immunogenicity across the three animal species. Notably, antibody titers from NAb pO18-10, targeting site 6 on VP1 and VP3, correlated strongly with VNT results. This study provides comprehensive insights into the antigenic structure of FMDV serotype O and lays the groundwork for developing new methods to detect NAbs.",,,

To assess the impact of COF on Thoroughbred yearling sales and racing performance, and whether these are improved by arthroscopic removal. We hypothesised that surgical removal of COF improves Thoroughbred yearling sales and racing performance. Retrospective observational. Using clinical records from years 2015-2018, 46 Thoroughbred yearlings with COF were identified and allocated to a surgically (SX group, n = 26) or conservatively (No-SX, n = 20) treated group. A control group consisted of 138 sire- and year-matched siblings without radiographic findings. Data were analysed using ANOVA with backward selection regression. Identification of COF on radiographic surveys was associated with significantly lower sales prices and total winnings, regardless of treatment, with horses in both SX and No-SX groups achieving fewer starts and seasons raced when compared with controls. Overall variables and co-variables indicating racing and sales performances did not differ significantly between the SX group and the No-SX group; however, horses with COF treated surgically were more likely to achieve a racing career than those treated conservatively (OR: 6.2, p = 0.03, 95% CI: 0.987-69.690). When compared with control horses, conservative management of COF was overall associated with significantly poorer sales and racing performances. No such differences were observed between the SX group and the control group. The limited sample size and single centre limit generalisability. No further radiographic re-examination data were obtained during horses' careers. Our data indicates that COF can impair a Thoroughbred's racing and especially sales performance.

The PRRS virus (PRRSV) has high rates of mutation and evolution. We examined the influence on ORF5 Sanger sequencing outcomes of various concentrations of a wild-type (WT) PRRSV (lineage 1A RFLP 1-7-4) and a modified-live vaccine (MLV) virus (lineage 5 RFLP 2-5-2) in the same sample. Vaccine-like sequences were detected more frequently than the WT virus when the MLV virus was present at equal or higher concentrations than the WT virus. This result suggests that ORF5 Sanger sequencing may preferentially detect the dominant virus in samples containing more than one virus, potentially masking WT viral infections in vaccinated herds. Although our findings highlight a limitation in identifying co-circulation of strains, Sanger sequencing is still widely used as an accessible tool to characterize PRRSVs. Advanced sequencing techniques, such as NGS or CLAMP-based approaches, would complement Sanger sequencing results and allow improved detection of co-circulating variants by minimizing consensus sequence bias and selectively blocking vaccine-like sequences.",,,

There is an absence of research that investigates fatalities of horses within the sport of eventing. To use a combination of media reports and eventing federation databases to describe and document equine fatalities in equestrian eventing, including their context, location and a basic pathology. Descriptive study. A study describing equine fatalities that occurred between 1998 and 2023. Study data were taken from a combination of media reports (to identify occurrences of equine fatalities) and federation databases (to confirm a fatality did indeed occur and validate data). One hundred and ten equine fatality records were included. Median horse age was 12 years. 62.7% of equine fatalities were not associated with a report of a horse fall during the cross-country phase. Of all fatalities, 36.4% involved a musculoskeletal (MSK) injury, 36.4% were considered sudden death and 27.3% did not report the pathology (unknown). A total of 47.5% of MSK-related fatalities and 90% of sudden death fatalities occurred during cross-country but were unrelated to horse falls at cross-country fences. The data presented within this study do not provide a complete picture of global equine eventing fatalities during the study period. Details around the context/pathology of fatalities are also limited because of the sources they are derived from. This study demonstrates that equine fatalities in eventing occur in contexts other than horse falls, including as a result of MSK injury and sudden death. Future research and risk management work in eventing should include work that investigates sudden death and MSK injury in eventing horses and their causative/associative factors.",O'Brien D,PO Box 1167,

In clinical environments, AMR often undermines the effectiveness of antibacterial treatments, underscoring the urgent need to discover and develop new antibacterial agents or alternatives to antibiotics. Usnic acid, a secondary metabolite derived from lichens, has emerged as a promising candidate owing to its diverse pharmacological properties, which include antibacterial, immune-regulating, antiaging, and anti-inflammatory activities. Extensive research has shown that usnic acid exhibits strong direct antibacterial effects against Gram-positive bacteria and acts as an antimicrobial adjuvant to enhance the therapeutic efficacy of antibiotic drugs against Gram-negative pathogens. Its mechanisms of action are multifaceted, encompassing the inhibition of RNA, DNA, and protein synthesis; suppression of bacterial efflux pump protein expression and membrane-localized drug-resistant enzyme activity; disruption of cell membrane integrity and metabolic homeostasis; and reduction of virulence factor production and biofilm formation. Despite its potential, the clinical application of usnic acid as an antibacterial agent faces significant challenges including poor aqueous solubility, low bioavailability, and dose-dependent toxicity. To overcome these limitations, nanodelivery systems such as liposomes and polymeric nanoparticles have been developed to enhance solubility, improve targeted delivery, and reduce toxicity, thereby expanding its therapeutic potential. Structural modification can also enhance the antibacterial activity and address solubility issues. This review systematically consolidates current knowledge on usnic acid's antibacterial properties, molecular mechanisms, and combinatorial therapies. It critically evaluates advancements in nanoformulation strategies, assesses safety and toxicity profiles, and identifies obstacles to its development as a clinically viable antibacterial agent. By addressing these aspects, this review aims to provide actionable insights, foster interdisciplinary dialogue, and catalyze further innovation in leveraging this natural product to combat AMR.",,,

This can be offset by using complex diets. The terms 'complexity' and 'complex diets' are used in practice and academia but are not precisely defined. The aim of this review was to identify the ingredients in weaner diets, their inclusion levels and how the number of ingredients or complexity of diets influences weaner performance, intestinal and systemic health, environmental sustainability and antibiotic use. Not all diets are formulated equally. Some prioritize meeting the weaner's nutritional needs, while other diets seek to align health promotion and adaptation to the environment. Diet composition is of vital importance for young piglets, thus the components needed in these complex diets must be defined. Healthy, environmentally adapted pigs have excellent growth performance. We therefore recommend use of a new term, 'gut health supporting diets', to encompass the many concepts associated with diet complexity.",,,

Because of their wide variety of habitats with varying environmental conditions and local food availability, the free-ranging European brown bear was used as a model species to study the dietary macronutrient profile in relation to climate region (using the Köppen-Geiger climate classification system), season and supplemental feeding of anthropogenic foods. Climates included were cold (regions in Norway, Sweden, Estonia and Slovakia), temperate (regions in Slovenia and Spain) and warm (regions in Croatia and Greece). Regardless of climate region, protein content was higher, and carbohydrate content was lower in spring and summer diets compared to autumn and winter diets. Diets in warm climate regions were marked by a high (digestible) carbohydrate content compared to cold climates and a low protein content compared to cold and temperate climates. A low protein to non-protein ratio, close to the optimum reported for brown bears (0.2 ME basis), was found in autumn in every climate type, and was present all year round in warm climates. At supplemented feeding sites, high (digestible) carbohydrate and low protein contents were observed compared to natural feeding sites. Supplementation also decreased seasonal variation in macronutrient composition. Fat content did not vary across seasons, climate type or with supplemental feeding. Fibre contents varied with season, climate type and supplemental feeding; however, differences were very small. Although seasonal fluctuations of macronutrients follow similar patterns across climate regions, macronutrient profiles differ between climate regions, corroborating that external conditions can influence macronutrient balance in species.",,,

These chemicals are now commonly detected in human tissues, raising concerns about their potential health effects. While their presence as environmental pollutants is well known, their specific impact on platelet function and the associated cardiovascular risks remains poorly understood. To explore how AA and BPA affect platelet physiology, we performed in vitro assays to assess platelet activation and aggregation following exposure to these compounds. We also used bioinformatic tools to identify potential protein targets in human platelets and carried out molecular docking simulations to investigate how AA and BPA interact with key enzymes involved in platelet regulation. Both AA and BPA exposure led to a significant increase in platelet activation and aggregation, suggesting an elevated risk of thrombosis. Proteomic analysis identified around 1,230 potential protein targets, with 191 affected by AA and 429 by BPA. These proteins are primarily involved in oxidative stress, apoptosis, and signaling pathways regulated by protein kinase C (PKC), p38α-MAPK, and superoxide dismutase (SOD). Molecular modeling further revealed that AA and BPA form stable complexes with several of these enzymes, indicating direct interference with platelet function. Our study shows that AA and BPA can enhance platelet reactivity and aggregation, which are key factors in the development of cardiovascular disease (CVD). By identifying specific molecular pathways and targets affected by these pollutants, we provide new insights into their potential role in promoting thrombotic conditions. These findings highlight the urgent need for greater public health awareness and stronger regulatory efforts to reduce human exposure to AA and BPA.",Burgos CF; Quintana S,Department of Physiology,

Seaberry ( LC-DAD-MS and LC-DAD analyses identified dominant metabolites, including isorhamnetin, quercetin glycosides, kaempferol glycosides, catechin, zeaxanthin, and lutein. In the 4T1 mouse model, seaberry treatment resulted in a significant, dose-dependent reduction in tumor volume (43% and 48% compared to controls) and a decrease in the mitotic activity index. Serum cytokine analysis showed dose-dependent reductions in IL-6, IL-10, and TNF-α. In the rat chemopreventive model, high-dose seaberry improved cancer prognosis by reducing the ratio of poorly differentiated tumors and increasing caspase-3 and Bax expression while decreasing Ki-67 and malondialdehyde levels. Both treatment doses elevated the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio and reduced the expression of cancer stem cell markers CD44, EpCam, and VEGF compared to controls.

The results of such assessments should be reliable, consistent and reproducible. We review the steps that should ideally be taken to develop, validate and apply animal welfare assessment tools. The first step should be to find a definition of animal welfare that the various stakeholders can agree upon. The second step should be to formulate and agree upon a framework for the evaluation of animal welfare. Both theoretical/conceptual frameworks, which provide a structure for research and suggest which facets are considered important, and ethical frameworks, which explicate the underlying moral position, should be considered. Finally, animal welfare assessment tools should be developed and validated based on both the adopted welfare definition and the welfare evaluation framework(s). However, this three-step approach has not always been followed in the development of welfare assessment tools currently in use. We expect that transparency and clarity regarding the underlying definitions and frameworks will increase the likelihood that the resulting welfare assessment tools will give similar weight to the aspects considered relevant to animal welfare, as it helps to specify the aspects that are considered to be key elements of animal welfare. This approach should lead to convergent assessment results and higher correlation of welfare indicators between assessment tools.",,,

Traditional methods, such as force platforms and three-dimensional kinematic systems, though accurate, are often costly and require specialized equipment, limiting their broader application. This study aims to evaluate an alternative approach using a single triaxial accelerometer positioned in different anatomical regions (neck, sternum, pelvis, and right knee) to analyze gait patterns in healthy dogs. Twenty-four clinically healthy dogs were used, divided into two groups based on body weight: ≤ 15 kg (G-15) and >15 kg (G+15). A wireless triaxial accelerometer sensor was utilized. Acceleration data were collected during walking and trotting in different anatomical positions: neck, sternum, pelvis, and right knee. The data were processed using Fourier analysis to extract harmonic frequencies and analyzed for acceleration peaks and autocorrelation to assess gait symmetry. The findings showed that larger and heavier dogs (G+15) exhibited lower movement frequencies and more stable patterns, especially during trotting, while smaller and lighter dogs (G-15) demonstrated higher frequencies and greater variability. Significant differences in acceleration peaks were observed between body regions, with the pelvis and knee showing the highest values. However, harmonic frequencies did not vary significantly between the different anatomical regions. The autocorrelation analysis revealed that, in larger dogs, the sternum and pelvis regions presented greater consistency, indicating enhanced stability during locomotion. These findings suggest that using a single accelerometer in different body regions is a practical and effective methodology for gait analysis in dogs, allowing the identification of locomotion differences among dogs of varying sizes and movement phases. This approach offers an accurate alternative for veterinary biomechanical studies, with potential clinical applications in the diagnosis and monitoring of gait abnormalities. The use of a single triaxial accelerometer proved effective for canine gait analysis, revealing differences by body weight. The sternum and pelvis are ideal monitoring regions, suggesting applications in biomechanical and clinical studies.",,,

However, defining exposure is complex, and the resulting risk profiles can vary depending on the definition used. To quantify the spatially based exposure of surrounding communities to swine farms in North Carolina, three spatially explicit metrics were developed at the census tract-level: IDx1: number of households within 1-mile from a hog farm, IDx2: Co-kriging using the number of hogs and manure lagoons, and IDx3: hog density per square mile. Then, the correlation between these indices and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)'s Social Vulnerability Index (SVI) and Environmental Justice Index (EJI), which are generalized vulnerability measures, was evaluated to assess direct impact from swine farms versus multiple stressors. The three indices differed visually, with IDx3 strongly correlated with IDx1 (0.8) and moderately correlated with IDx2 (0.4). CDC EJI and SVI were not prominently correlated with any of the swine-farm specific indices (≤0.3) indicating limited overlap. The correlation between swine-farm-specific indices and CDC SVI was slightly pronounced in rural areas indicating socially vulnerable populations are more likely to live near swine farming areas in rural census tracts. Having swine farm-specific indices offers a more tailored and nuanced understanding of the potential health and environmental risks. However, the differences between the maps and the varying correlations underscored how different definitions of exposure can yield distinct narratives about which neighborhoods are at risk. Defining and measuring potential exposure, considering factors like proximity, duration, frequency, vulnerability, and cumulative impact, is highly challenging. The study emphasizes the need for a hierarchical framework to quantify and compare environmental exposures, addressing risk-modifying factors and individual-level exposure across space and time before implying direct exposure risks. This approach enables more informed planning for targeted solutions and fosters collaboration among stakeholders, facilitating critical discussions on integrated One Health solutions.",Kandwal R,Independent Researcher,

We aimed to determine whether these abnormalities are unique features of sepsis or are also present in dogs with non-septic critical illness. Secondary aims were to assess relationships between coagulation assay results and circulating markers of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), and to relate coagulation assay abnormalities with survival in dogs with sepsis. This prospective single-center observational cohort study enrolled 55 client-owned dogs that satisfied at least 2 systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) criteria. Dogs with a bacterial infection were categorized as sepsis, those without evidence of infection were categorized as non-infectious systemic inflammation (nSIRS). Clotting times, fibrinogen and D-dimer concentrations, and activities of antithrombin (AT), antiplasmin (AP), thrombin activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor (TAFI), and total and active plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) were measured. Thrombin generation and overall hemostasis potential assays were performed and concentrations of cell-free DNA (cfDNA) and H3.1 nucleosomes quantitated. Compared to dogs with nSIRS, dogs with sepsis had higher fibrinogen concentrations, greater endogenous thrombin potential, higher AP and TAFI activities and greater overall hemostasis and coagulation potential values. H3.1 nucleosome and cfDNA concentrations were strongly correlated and significantly associated with various coagulation variables. In dogs with sepsis, non-survivors had lower AT activity, and higher active PAI-1 and H3.1 nucleosome concentrations. Relative to non-septic critically ill dogs, dogs with sepsis are hyperfibrinogenemic, hypercoagulable and have higher AP and TAFI activities.

Amlodipine is used to treat hypertension in dogs, and we anticipated that amlodipine administration might improve renal function in dogs. However, the effect of amlodipine on canine renal function is unknown. Therefore, this study evaluated changes in symmetric dimethylarginine (SDMA) levels before and after amlodipine administration in pet dogs that had been diagnosed with CKD based on persistently elevated SDMA levels and were being treated with amlodipine alone for any reason. We also conducted a comparative investigation of whether there were any differences in SDMA changes depending on whether these dogs with CKD had hypertension. This study employed a retrospective design. The study subjects were pet dogs that exhibited persistently elevated SDMA (≥14 μg/dL), were diagnosed with CKD, and were treated with amlodipine. Profile data such as breed, sex, and age, as well as data on blood chemistry tests, blood pressure, heart rate, and echocardiograms before and after amlodipine administration, were collected. Forty-five dogs were included in the study, of which 20 were hypertensive (HT: systolic arterial pressure ≥160 mmHg) and 25 were non-hypertensive (Non-HT: systolic arterial pressure <160 mmHg). Mean SDMA was significantly lower after drug administration compared with before administration in both the HT and Non-HT groups. Moreover, we found that cardiac output (CO) increased in all dogs with CKD treated with amlodipine. Blood pressure measurements showed that the blood pressure decreased in both the HT and Non-HT groups. It is believed that the increase in CO due to amlodipine administration increases glomerular filtration rate, which may have led to a decrease in SDMA levels. Based on the rate of decrease in systolic arterial pressure, we considered that amlodipine might decrease blood pressure by a greater amount in patients with higher levels of hypertension. In this study, we showed that amlodipine administration improved SDMA in dogs with CKD regardless of whether they were hypertension. We also showed that amlodipine could be safely used to treat normotensive dogs.",,,

However, overreliance on antibiotics has led to a global antimicrobial resistance (AMR) crisis, jeopardizing progress made over the past decades. Antimicrobial resistance poses a critical public health challenge, affecting humans, animals, and the environment. The AMR challenge is particularly dire in Nigeria owing to the extensive antibiotic use across various sectors and ineffective antimicrobial stewardship programs. This narrative review summarizes the literature from January 2018 to December 2023, focusing on the current trends in AMR in Nigeria, including knowledge of antimicrobial usage, prescription patterns, and adherence to guidelines for humans, animals, and their shared environments. High antibiotic resistance patterns were detected in isolates recovered from healthcare settings, food supply chains, companion animals, wildlife, and the environment. Factors exacerbating the AMR crisis in Nigeria include poor regulation of antimicrobial agents, improper empirical prescriptions, inadequate infection prevention practices, arbitrary and prophylactic use of antibiotics in food-producing animals, environmental contamination, and insufficient surveillance programs. To effectively mitigate this crisis, it is essential to adopt the One Health approach, which prioritizes collaborative efforts among stakeholders, including governmental agencies, healthcare institutions, veterinary experts, farmers, and the scientific community, to address the convergence of human, animal, and environmental health. These efforts will promote transdisciplinary surveillance approaches and the establishment of policies aimed at ameliorating the impact of AMR on the Nigerian economy, the well-being of its population, and diverse ecosystems.",,,

Forty healthy (Landrace × Yorkshire) binary crossbred pigs with the same birth age and weaned at Day 21 were assigned to two treatments including L (5.0-5.5 kg) and H (6.5-7.0 kg), each with five replicates and four piglets per replicate. The two groups were fed the same diet. Data revealed that the average daily gain of high-weight piglets after weaning at 21 days was significantly higher than that of low-weight weaned piglets (p < 0.05); The crude fat (EE) and crude protein (CP) of H-piglets was significantly higher than that of l-piglets; There was no significant difference in the contents of total protein (TP), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), glutamic pyruvic transaminase (ALT), cholesterol (CHO), glucose (GLU), immunoglobulin M (IgM), triglyceride (TG), albumin (ALB), glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (AST) and UREA between H-piglets and l-piglets after weaning at 21 days (p > 0.05). There was no significant difference in the villus height (VH), crypt depth (CD) and VH:CD ratio (VRC), and no significant difference in the relative abundance of intestinal flora at phyla and genus level (p > 0.05). In summary, the growth performance of piglets after weaning at 21 days is related to their weaning weight.",,,

In this review article, we argue that even habitats that are not considered extremes are facing unpredictable, rapid, and strong modifications due to human activities that expose animals to novel extreme conditions. Thus, physiological research on these animals can offer insight on the role of physiological plasticity in driving their resilience and adaptation. To this end, we discuss how stress physiology (with a particular focus on oxidative stress) has a central role in mediating the interaction between the exposome (measure of all the environmental exposures of an individual in a lifetime) and cellular processes (bio-exposome) in the contexts of relevant extreme anthropogenic changes to the habitat conditions. We also provide concrete examples on the relationship between oxidative stress and the bio-exposome in free-living animals, and how this research can be relevant to human health. Finally, we propose future research directions integrating the bio-exposome and the One Health framework to achieve a holistic understanding of the proximate mechanisms underlying individual responses to extreme anthropogenic environmental changes.",,,

Currently, NADC30-like PRRSV has undergone complex recombination with local Chinese strains, which has exacerbated the evolution of PRRSV. Recently, new recombinant PRRSV-2 strains from four lineages (lineages 1, 3, 5, and 8) have emerged in China. However, information on the pathogenicity of the novel isolate in China remains limited. To further our knowledge about the isolate, FJLIUY2017 and PRRSV2/CN/G8/2018 were selected to analyze their pathogenicity for piglets. The PRRSV FJLIUY2017 and PRRSV2/CN/G8/2018 strains were isolated by porcine alveolar macrophages (PAMs) and MARC-145CD Full-length genome analysis revealed that FJLIUY2017 and PRRSV2/CN/G8/2018 share 89.2% identity with each other, and in particular, they had a low degree of homology (< 92%) with PRRSV sequences available in GenBank. Phylogenetic and recombination analyses revealed that the two strains were recombinant viruses from lineages 1, 3, 5.1, and 8.7 strains. Animal studies indicated that FJLIUY-2017 resulted in the typical clinical signs of PRRSV, including persistent fever, higher viremia, severe lung lesions, and 20% mortality, whereas PRRSV2/CN/G8/2018 caused moderate clinical symptoms and no mortality during the challenge period. Hyper-immune sera against the major vaccine strains JXA1-R (lineage 8) and Ingelvac PRRS MLV (Lineage 5) failed to neutralize two strains. FJLIUY-2017 caused persistent fever, higher viremia, 20% mortality and exhibited higher pathogenicity in piglets compared to PRRSV2/CN/G8/2018.

40369583,Lyophilized MSC-EVs attenuates COVID-19 pathogenesis by regulating the JAK/STAT pathway.,2025-05-15,Stem cell research & therapy,10.1186/s13287-025-04284-8,"The JAK/STAT signaling pathway plays a crucial role in the release of interferons (IFNs) and the proinflammatory response during SARS-CoV-2 infection, contributing to the cytokine storm characteristic of severe COVID-19 cases. STAT3, a key protein in this pathway, has been implicated in promoting inflammation, making its inhibition a potential therapeutic strategy to mitigate disease severity. Mesenchymal Stem Cell-derived Extracellular Vesicles (MSC-EVs), enriched with immunomodulatory and antiviral miRNAs, offer a promising therapeutic approach by modulating gene expression and regulating inflammatory responses. This study investigates the ability of Lyophilized MSC-EVs to inhibit the JAK/STAT pathway, highlighting their potential application in COVID-19 management. Male Syrian hamsters were used as an experimental model, housed under controlled laboratory conditions. SARS-CoV-2 (hCoV-19/Egypt/NRC-03/2020) was propagated in Vero E6 cells, and viral titers were determined using plaque assays. Hamsters were intranasally challenged with the virus and treated intraperitoneally with 0.5 mL of lyophilized human Wharton's jelly-derived MSC-extracellular vesicles (MSC-EVs). Histopathological evaluations were performed on lung tissues using H&E, Masson's trichrome, and immunohistochemical staining. Morphometric analyses were conducted to assess lung injury and fibrosis. Western blotting was employed to evaluate protein expression. All procedures adhered to ethical and biosafety guidelines. The administration of MSC-EVs significantly upregulated the expression levels of miRNA-146a, miRNA-124, miRNA-155, miRNA-29b, miRNA-7, miRNA-145 and miRNA-18a compared to their levels in the COVID-19 group, suggesting a targeted release of miRNA-cargo from the MSC-EVs into the lung tissue of the animals. MSC-EVs impaired the activation of the STAT3/STAT1 signaling pathway and reduced the cytokine storm and coagulopathy associated with COVID-19. These findings suggest that MSC-EVs have the potential to effectively mitigate the pathogenesis of COVID-19 by targeting the JAK/STAT signaling pathway. Further research is needed to fully understand the mechanisms underlying the therapeutic effects of MSC-EVs and their clinical application in combating the COVID-19 pandemic.",,,hajirsh@uhb.edu.sa.

Recent research points to AhR's critical participation in male reproductive physiology, particularly in spermatogenesis, hormone signaling, and the maintenance of sperm quality. Both endogenous ligands (e.g., dietary and gut microbiota-derived metabolites) and exogenous pollutants (e.g., dioxins and benzo-α-pyrene) influence AhR-mediated pathways, making it a key link between environmental exposures and male fertility. This review highlights AhR's influence on the male reproductive system, emphasizing the role of endogenous AhR ligands and AhR expression in the maturation and function of male reproductive organs. Environmental AhR agonists have been shown to induce oxidative stress, hormonal imbalance, and sperm DNA damage, which impact harmfully on the spermatogenesis process, which leads to reproductive abnormalities. Conversely, certain natural compounds such as resveratrol, curcumin, and lycopene appear to antagonize AhR activation and reduce its negative effects, thus offering potential protective benefits against male reproductive toxicity. Nevertheless, discrepancies persist regarding the exact interplay between AhR signaling and critical reproductive hormones such as testosterone and LH, and it remains unclear how transgenerational epigenetic changes triggered by AhR activation might affect long-term male fertility. AhR is pivotal in male reproductive physiology, influencing spermatogenesis, sperm quality, and hormone regulation through its interactions with both endogenous and environmental ligands. Persistent pollutants such as dioxins and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons cause oxidative damage and hormonal disturbances via AhR, contributing to reduced sperm quality and fertility.",,,kashifalkitaa@covm.uobaghdad.edu.iq.

This problem is exacerbated by the increase in acquired antimicrobial resistance. Bacteriophage (phage) therapy has emerged as a promising alternative for treating infection classically treated with antibiotics, offering a targeted approach to combat this infection. This study aimed to evaluate the therapeutic potential of 7 phages, focusing on their suitability for treating canine infections, as well as their purification and safety analysis for therapeutic use. Two self-isolated phages and five provided phages were analysed. All tested phages reduced bacterial load in vitro; however, their efficacy varied across different concentrations. The host range analysis revealed a spectrum between 9.8 and 68.6% of canine clinical P. aeruginosa isolates. In our in vitro tests 3 out of 7 phages were able to significantly reduce the biofilm biomass, achieving reductions up to 93.38%. The sequence analysis did not discover known virulence factors and genes connected to antimicrobial resistance mechanisms. The self-isolated phages were classified as lysogenic, whereas the other phages had a lytic infection cycle. Through the purification of the phages, high-titre phage preparations (> 10 Investigating phages as alternative treatment option seems promising with lytic phages covering a broad host range and a genomic potential for biofilm degradation.

This study aimed to explore the difference in semen quality, testicular morphological structure, and gene expression profiles of testes of Angora rabbits in spring (no heat stress), summer (intense heat stress), and autumn (no heat stress) seasons. Heat stress during summer significantly reduced semen quality and damaged testicular morphology and spermatogenesis, which recovered to normal levels in autumn, although semen quality recovery was notably slow. RNA-Seq analysis showed that the expression levels of 8703 genes changed significantly in summer, but their expression levels in autumn returned to those in spring, which was consistent with the testicular morphology analysis results in different seasons. Enrichment analysis revealed that the DEGs were primarily associated with spermatogenesis, sperm motility, spermatid development, cell death, regulation of apoptotic processes, and responses to external stimuli. The MAPK, Rap1, TNF, Ras, Apoptosis, and Wnt signaling pathways regulated reproduction under heat stress. In addition, minimal variations in testicular morphology and gene expression profiles were observed between autumn and spring. Gene expression pattern analysis showed that genes with high expression in summer mainly participated in the regulation of cell apoptosis, immunity, and response to heat stress, whereas genes with low expression in summer mainly participated in the regulation of spermatogenesis. This study investigated the influence of different seasons on the reproductive performance of male Angora rabbits and provided initial insights into the molecular regulatory mechanisms underlying the testicular response to heat stress during summer.",,,hdwscience@163.com.

Previously, H5N1 was primarily an avian pathogen with limited infection in mammals. The emergence of clade 2.3.4.4b H5N1 in dairy herds across multiple states reveals the virus's adaptation to mammalian hosts and highlights its potential for zoonotic transmission, raising important concerns for public health, veterinary medicine, and agriculture. The virus demonstrated unique tropism for mammary tissue, with high viral loads detected in milk. Genomic analysis identified mutations that enhance binding to mammalian receptors and facilitate systemic spread. Viral RNA was found in raw milk, posing food safety risks; however, standard pasteurization effectively inactivated the virus. Epidemiological data indicate the outbreak likely began with spillover from wild birds or contaminated fomites, followed by efficient local transmission within herds. Forty-one human cases linked to infected dairy operations were confirmed. The outbreak caused significant economic losses due to decreased milk production and trade restrictions. Although human-to-human transmission remains low, the zoonotic risk requires urgent attention. The 2024 HPAI H5N1 outbreak in U.S. dairy cattle highlights critical gaps in surveillance, biosecurity, and coordination across sectors. A One Health approach integrating veterinary, public health, and environmental efforts is essential. Recommendations include improved surveillance, stringent biosecurity measures, occupational safety protocols, focused research on viral evolution, and investment in diagnostics and vaccines.

Tick midgut proteins play essential roles in blood digestion, feeding, toxic waste processing, and pathogen transmission. Dermacentor nuttalli is the primary vector of tick-borne pathogens, including rickettsioses in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. However, there is a lack of genomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic information regarding the biology of D. nuttalli. In this study, we assembled and compared the midgut transcriptomes of female D. nuttalli ticks at 0, 24, 48, 72, and 96 h during blood feeding, identifying the genes with differentially regulated expression following feeding. The obtained data were compiled and annotated in multiple databases including Nr, NT, PFAM, KOG, KEGG, and GO.

The transcripts were classified into eight large categories, including immunogenic proteases (8.37%), protease inhibitors (0.85%), transporters (3.96%), ligand binding proteins (1.98%), ribosomal function proteins (0.94%), heat shock proteins (0.30%), other proteases and miscellaneous proteins (57.61%), and unknown proteins (26.00%). Significant differences were observed in the genes obtained at 0, 24, 48, 72, and 96 h during blood feeding. The differentially expressed genes include catalytic proteins that play an important role in accelerating biochemical reactions, binding activity proteins which are involved in various molecular interactions, and proteins that actively participate in multiple metabolic pathways and cellular processes. Notably, the gene expression in the midgut of D. nuttalli shows dynamic changes every 24 h throughout the blood-feeding process. This change may represent an equivalent strategy of antigenic variation for ticks, designed to protect their essential feeding function against the host's immune system.

High-risk subtypes, particularly HPV16, require rigorous screening and long-term surveillance to control cervical cancer. However, traditional HPV testing is hampered by the need for nucleic acid extraction, reliance on specialized technicians, and fluorescence detection equipment, limiting its suitability for rapid on-site testing. In this study, we developed a Concanavalin A-assisted extraction-free one-pot recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA) CRISPR/Cas12a assay (ConRCA) for HPV16. Concanavalin A-coated magnetic beads were used for target enrichment and nucleic acid-extraction-free processing.

CRISPR-Cas system is the adaptive immune system of bacteria, which is also closely related to the drug resistance and virulence of bacteria. However, the effect and mechanism of cas3 (type I-Fa) in A. baumannii is still unclear. In this study, we successfully constructed a cas3 deletion mutant (19606Δcas3) and complemented strain (19606Δcas3/pcas3) to study the regulatory mechanism of type I-Fa cas3 on bacterial virulence. Our results showed that deletion of cas3(type I-Fa) significantly reduced the biofilm formation, virulence and pathogenicity to mice. The organ bacterial load of mice infected with cas3 deletion strain was significantly reduced, the lung inflammation was slightly changed, and the serum cytokine level was also decreased. All results demonstrated that cas3 enhanced the virulence and pathogenicity of A. baumannii. Mechanism analysis showed that deletion of cas3 can lead to the down-regulation of virulence factors such as biofilm formation related factors and outer membrane protein A(ompA). In addition, cas3 was also involved in the regulation of carbon metabolism and oxidative phosphorylation pathway of A. baumannii.

Female goats (n = 4) underwent autologous transplantation of the uterus via laparotomy. The pelvic tissue was carefully dissected and exposed. The uterine arteries were dissected to the entire internal iliac artery, and the ovarian veins were also dissected to the point where they crossed over the ureter. Back-table preparation was performed when the graft was removed. After the end-to-side anastomosis of the blood vessels was completed, vaginal anastomosis was performed. The surgery time, ischemia time, and surgical outcomes were recorded. After surgery, the viability of the uterus was examined via hysteroscopy, and an endometrial biopsy was performed. Overall, the survival rate of the animals was 75 % (one goat died because of an allergic reaction to the anesthetic medication one day after the operation). Among the three surviving goats, two resumed ovarian cyclicity. Adhesions in the cavity were observed in one goat. The goat UTx model is a good model for performing this procedure. Our results revealed that uterine function resumed in the majority of the animals, although pregnancy could not be confirmed.",,,004754@tool.caaumed.org.tw.

Molecular cell research,10.1016/j.bbamcr.2025.119988,"Heat stress (HS) is a significant health concern that adversely affects both human and animal health, particularly impacting liver function due to its central metabolic role. This study investigated the mechanisms underlying HS-induced liver injury, focusing on the role of ferroptosis, an iron-dependent form of cell death characterized by lipid peroxidation and cellular iron accumulation. Using mouse and cellular HS models, the results demonstrated that HS induced liver injury through ferroptosis, as evidenced by increased levels of malondialdehyde (MDA), oxidized glutathione (GSSG), and iron, alongside decreased glutathione (GSH) and glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) expression. The ferroptosis inhibitor Ferrostatin-1 (Fer-1) effectively mitigated HS-induced liver damage, reducing oxidative stress and restoring GPX4 levels. Furthermore, HS promoted the lysosomal degradation of GPX4 via the chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA) pathway, which was regulated by heat shock cognate protein 70 (HSC70) and lysosome-associated membrane protein 2A (LAMP2A). Knockdown of LAMP2A in hepatocytes significantly suppressed HS-induced GPX4 degradation, confirming the critical role of CMA in this process. Inhibition of CMA using Apoptozole, an HSC70 inhibitor, or Bafilomycin A1 (Baf-A1), a lysosomal inhibitor, further attenuated HS-induced ferroptosis and liver injury. These findings highlight the critical role of CMA-mediated GPX4 degradation in HS-induced ferroptosis and liver injury, providing potential therapeutic targets for mitigating HS-related liver damage.",,,mingxu110@mail.hzau.edu.cn.

The disease is caused by a double-stranded RNA virus of the genus Avibirnavirus, family Birnaviridae, namely, the infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV). Unfortunately, current methods for detecting IBDV lack adequate sensitivity. Accordingly, the advantages of the Speciﬁc High Sensitivity Enzymatic Reporter UnLOCKing (SHERLOCK) assay were employed to develop an ultrasensitive assay (IBD-SHERLOCK assay) for the detection of IBDV in clinical chicken tissues. The assay comprises two steps: isothermal preamplification of the target RNA through reverse transcription recombinase polymerase amplification (RT-RPA) and a subsequent detection step, which is based on the CRISPR-Cas13a system. The integration of lateral flow (LFD) visual detection of the IBD-SHERLOCK products strengthens the feasibility of the assay for use as a point-of-care test in chicken farms. Compared with RT-qPCR, this method exhibited ultra-analytical and clinical sensitivity. The assay has a lower detection limit of 5 aM, which is equivalent to three IBDV-RNA molecules. The assay demonstrated the ability to detect IBDV-RNA in 70 clinical field samples, 15 of which tested negative by RT-qPCR. This evidence highlights its superior sensitivity and potential for early detection of IBDV in chicken tissues. This study effectively established and verified a CRISPR-based diagnostic test for the early detection of IBDV in clinical chicken tissues, demonstrating remarkable specificity and sensitivity. The IBD-SHERLOCK assay can be used as a highly sensitive point-of-care diagnostic tool in chicken farms.",,,hatem.soliman@aun.edu.eg.

In this study, we investigated the impacts of TiLV on immunopathological changes, hematological profiles, and peripheral blood leukocyte dynamics in Nile tilapia using histopathological analyses, immunofluorescence assays, and flow cytometry. The histopathological findings revealed lymphoid depletion and increased melanomacrophage centers in hematopoietic organs as well as hepatic damage, which corroborates the systemic effects of TiLV. TiLV infection led to the rapid progression of viremia, with viral loads significantly increasing by 5 days post infection. Hematological analysis demonstrated marked anemia and leukopenia evidenced by a significant reduction in hematocrit and white blood cell counts. Among the leukocyte subpopulations, lymphocytes were the most profoundly depleted, primarily due to virus-induced apoptosis, as confirmed by in vitro apoptosis assays. Interestingly, granulocytes exhibited the highest TiLV infection rates at 46 %, which suggests the preferential tropism of these cells. Despite their role in innate immunity, granulocytes displayed minimal apoptotic changes, thereby indicating their potential function as reservoirs or vehicles for systemic viral dissemination. These findings highlight the possibly multifaceted strategies employed by TiLV to evade host defenses and establish systemic infection. Understanding the immunopathogenesis of TiLV infection is crucial for devising effective control strategies to safeguard global tilapia production.",,,tuchakorn.l@ku.th.
40368103,The role of age at first calving in shaping production and reproductive outcomes in Italian buffaloes.,,Journal of dairy science,10.3168/jds.2025-26369,"The age at first calving (AFC) is a critical parameter in dairy herd management due to its impact on feeding costs, genetic progress, longevity, and thus, farm profitability. With the growing global demand for buffalo milk products, recent advancements in reproductive practices and feeding techniques have contributed to a reduction in AFC in Italy. This study investigates the impact of AFC on the productive and reproductive performance of primiparous Italian Mediterranean buffaloes. Data were collected from 50,661 animals across 115 herds, covering 362,703 first-lactation test-day records from 2013 to 2023. The study analyzed productive traits, including milk yield (kg/d), days to milk peak (DMP, d), ECM (kg/d), fat and protein contents (%), and SCS. Reproductive traits, such as calving interval (CIN, d) and days open (DO, d), were analyzed from 2013 to 2021. Repeated mixed linear models were used to assess the effects of AFC on the afore-mentioned traits, accounting for DIM, calving year and season, and, when applicable, their interactions. Results highlighted a significant reduction in AFC (from 36 to 35 mo), CIN (from 457 to 447 d), and DO (from 147 to 136 d) over the studied period. Buffaloes with AFC >42 mo produced 0.52 kg/d more milk and 0.90 kg/d more ECM, with slightly higher fat content (+0.04%) compared with those with AFC ≤32 mo. This trend was consistent throughout DIM categories. Somatic cell score was significantly lower in buffaloes with AFC between 32 and 35 mo (2.78), whereas higher SCS was observed in those with AFC ≤32 mo (2.81) or >35 mo (2.80). Buffaloes with AFC comprised between 34 and 37 mo had significantly lower CIN and DO (449-450 and 137-139 d, respectively) compared with those with both lower or greater AFC (454 and 143 d, respectively), whereas DMP was not significantly affected by AFC. As expected, likely due to the out-of-breeding technique, the highest values for both CIN and DO were observed in buffaloes calving the first time in winter and spring (on average 455 and 145 d, respectively), and lower values were recorded for those calving in autumn and summer (on average 449 and 138 d, respectively). Buffaloes with AFC ≤30 mo that calved during winter exhibited significantly greater DO (>150 d) compared with those calving with AFC >42 mo during the same period (140 d). This is likely due to the lower capacity to restore ovarian activity that may reduce fertility in younger buffaloes compared with older ones. Conversely, buffaloes with AFC >42 mo that calved in summer tended to have extended DO (139 d) in respect to those with lower AFC (≤30 mo) in the same period (135 d). This may be due to the interaction between the increased photoperiod and the reduced feed intake caused by summer heat stress, which may have an effect on older buffaloes' fertility. Therefore, AFC between 34 and 37 mo represents the optimal window for Italian Mediterranean buffaloes, combining shorter CIN and DO with sustained milk production. The reduction of AFC could significantly enhance farm profitability and may be achievable through the integration of breeding programs, better reproductive technologies across seasons, and targeted nutritional strategies during the preweaning and prepartum phases.",Biffani S; Gomez-Carpio M,Italian National Association of Buffalo Breeders; Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (CNR),matteo.santinello@unina.it.
40368102,Feasibility of milk mid infrared spectroscopy for large-scale screening of hematic traits in dairy buffaloes.,,Journal of dairy science,10.3168/jds.2025-26414,"Blood profile testing is a valuable tool for monitoring the metabolism, health, and nutritional status of lactating dairy animals, including buffaloes. However, conducting extensive analyses on a large scale is not feasible due to high costs, labor, the need for invasive procedures, and consequent animals' stress. The utilization of the Fourier-transform mid infrared (FT-MIR) spectroscopy to predict hematic traits from milk spectral information may represent an effective opportunity for the Italian sector, given that milk samples are regularly taken from animals monthly during the lactation for official testing. This study aims to test the ability of milk FT-MIR spectra to predict the most relevant buffaloes' hematic components. Blood and milk samples were collected 1 time from 308 buffaloes (98 primiparous and 210 pluriparous) at different stages of lactation, reared on 9 Italian farms. The hematic concentrations of urea, creatinine, glucose, total bilirubin, cholesterol, triglycerides, total protein, albumin, globulin, alanine and aspartate aminotransferases, alkaline phosphatase, lactate dehydrogenase, gamma-glutamyl transferase, and creatine kinase were measured using reference analysis to evaluate the predictive ability of FT-MIR. The 308 milk samples were scanned with a MilkoScan (Foss Electric A/S, Hillerød, Denmark) to record FT-MIR spectra.

A retrospective cohort study was conducted on 1,090 white veal calves originating from 3 Belgian veal herds. Clinical scoring and quick thoracic ultrasound (qTUS) follow-up were done by 4 experienced operators at arrival (wk 0), at the start of the first metaphylactic treatment with doxycycline (treatment initiation, wk 1), at the end of this metaphylactic treatment (short-term evaluation, wk 3) and on a long-term evaluation point (wk 10-12). Cure was defined as complete reaeration of previously consolidated lung tissue. Pathogens were identified using culture and nanopore sequencing. One week after arrival, healthy lungs (no consolidation), mild pneumonia (consolidation <1 cm), moderate pneumonia (consolidation 1-2.5 cm), and severe pneumonia (consolidation ≥3 cm) were identified in 46.9%, 12.4%, 21.4%, and 19.4% of calves, respectively. Short-term cure was 59.3% for calves with mild pneumonia, 50.2% for calves with moderate pneumonia, and 32.7% for calves with severe pneumonia, resulting in a total short-term cure of 45.9%. Coronavirus, respiratory syncytial virus, influenza D virus, and Mycoplasmopsis bovis were circulating during treatment. At the long-term evaluation point (wk 10-12), final cure was 59.3%, 55.8%, and 40.3% for calves with mild, moderate, and severe pneumonia at treatment initiation, respectively. Multivariable regression models indicated that different interactions between qTUS categories and number of affected quadrants were associated with short- and long-term odds of cure. Generated models resulted in 3 classification methods, either based on maximum consolidation depth, number of affected quadrants, or an integrated system of both. Calves with clinical pneumonia (Wisconsin score ≥5 and lung consolidation ≥1 cm) had decreased short-term odds to be cured after metaphylaxis compared with calves with subclinical pneumonia (Wisconsin score <5 and lung consolidation ≥1 cm; odds ratio = 0.43; 95% CI: 0.27-0.67). For calves with severe pneumonia in wk 10-12, when compared with calves in a lower qTUS category, ADG and CCW were reduced by 104 g/day (SD = 13; 95% CI: 78-130) and 7.1kg (SD = 1.9; 95% CI: 3.4-10.9), respectively. Categorization based on maximum consolidation depth, the number of affected quadrants, or an integrated system of both has the potential to be included in an ultrasound scoring system. However, based on the practicality for recording, reporting, and follow-up, the authors recommend categorizing calves into mild, moderate, and severe pneumonia based on maximum consolidation depth measurement, referred to as qTUS score, as a practical classification system for ultrasonographic lung assessment in calves.",Boone R,Veterinary Practice Venhei,stan.jourquin@ugent.be.
40368071,Effects of fisetin on virulence of Actinobacillus Pleuropneumoniae.,,Microbial pathogenesis,10.1016/j.micpath.2025.107692,"Porcine infectious pleuropneumonia (PCP), caused by Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae (APP), is a highly infectious respiratory disease of pigs, resulting in significant economic losses to the industry. Apx toxins are cytolytic virulence factors produced by APP. The natural flavonoid fisetin has a variety of biological activities, including antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. This study aimed to investigate the protective effects of fisetin against APP. Fisetin was found to effectively inhibit the hemolytic activity of both APP culture supernatants and the purified toxins, and blood agar plate results also showed that the addition of fisetin to APP reduced the diameter of the hemolytic zone. Fisetin did not influence the expression of Apx toxins, although it reduced that of the virulence factor CPS. In vitro, fisetin effectively inhibited APP cytotoxicity and intracellular colonization, as well as intracellular ROS production. Furthermore, it reduced the expression of IL-6, TNF-α, and TLR4 in porcine alveolar macrophages (3D4/21). In vivo, fisetin reduced APP colonization of mouse lung tissues and improved the survival rate of APP-infected mice. In conclusion, fisetin was found to reduce the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and ROS, decrease the risk of hemolysis, and attenuate APP virulence. The findings highlight the potential therapeutic value of fisetin in the management of APP infection. Further investigations into the mechanisms underlying the effects of fisetin are warranted.",,,beiwc@mail.hzau.edu.cn.

This study analyzed its antimicrobial and antibiofilm effects on Escherichia coli and Enterococcus spp. The Minimum Inhibitory Concentrations (MIC) and Minimum Biofilm Eradication Concentrations (MBEC) of 5-FU were determined against 17 clinical isolates, including resistant and susceptible strains. Biofilm formation and viability were assessed using crystal violet staining and resazurin assays, respectively. Growth curves were generated by exposing selected strains to increasing concentrations of 5-FU and monitoring Optical Density (OD) at 630 nm over 24 hours. Flow cytometry was used to evaluate membrane integrity, using Propidium Iodide (PI), and Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) production, with DCFH-DA, while Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) was used to show the structural alterations in bacterial cells. 5-FU MIC values ranged from 128-512 μM against E. coli and 1-32 μM against Enterococcus spp., with higher MICs observed against resistant strains. MBEC values exceeded planktonic MICs by up to 16-fold for E. coli and 64-fold for Enterococcus spp., ranging from 128 to >2048 μM. At MIC concentrations, membrane damage was increased in both species, while at subinhibitory concentrations, ROS production was exclusively detected in Enterococcus faecalis strains. SEM revealed severe structural alterations, including pore formation, cell shrinkage, cytoplasmic leakage, and cell disintegration highlighting the impact of 5-FU on bacterial morphology.

In a randomized control study, dairy and beef-on-dairy cross calves (n = 460) were enrolled into the following groups at diagnosis of dehydration: sick controls treated with IV fluids only (Con-IV), calves treated with IV fluids plus oral force-fed electrolytes (ELE), calves treated with IV fluids plus oral force-fed milk replacer (MILK), and healthy controls (Con-Health). Mortality and IV fluid treatment counts were analyzed. Blood metabolites and fecal dry matter were measured (n = 80). Mortality for each group was as follows: Con-Health, 5.31% (95% CI, 2.4% to 11.3%); Con-IV, 13.91% (95% CI, 8.6% to 21.5%); ELE, 10.43% (95% CI, 6.0% to 17.5%); and MILK, 11.3% (95% CI, 6.6% to 18.5%). Bicarbonate concentrations in the Con-IV group returned to normal levels 1 hour after treatment. Anion gap in MILK calves was the highest after treatment. The relative risk of additional IV treatments for dehydration was 1.5 (95% CI, 1.2 to 1.8), 1.3 (95% CI, 1.1 to 1.6), and 2.1 (95% CI, 1.8 to 2.4) for the Con-IV, ELE, and MILK groups, respectively. IV fluid with 14 g of sodium bicarbonate alone or combined with oral electrolytes was the most effective treatment for changes in acid-base balance in dehydrated bovine neonates in this study. IV therapy with sodium bicarbonate may practically rehydrate diarrheic calves in the field and correct acid-base balance. The use of forced feeding of ororuminal milk may not be beneficial for dehydrated and diarrheic calves.",,,

The analysis considered the 5 most recorded large breeds (26,369 dogs) and 10 most recorded toy/small breeds (90,002 dogs) in Banfield Pet Hospital's database from 2013 to 2019. Cox proportional hazards models evaluated associations between OvOb and gonadectomy status, gonadectomy age, sex, and primary breed. Models estimated OvOb rates in gonadectomized versus intact dogs of each breed and, separately, OvOb rates according to gonadectomy age. There was substantial breed variation in underlying (intact dog) OvOb rates among the 15 breeds. Pugs, Golden Retrievers, and Labrador Retrievers had highest underlying susceptibility to OvOb outcomes. There was some variation in relative OvOb rates among breeds, but breeds differing substantially from size group peers were limited. Among all toy/small breeds, gonadectomy at 3 or 6 months had hazard ratios (relative risks) lower than, or not statistically different from, gonadectomy at 1 year or older. For large dogs, OvOb outcomes associated with prepubertal gonadectomy varied by breed. Underlying susceptibility to OvOb varies by breed. Gonadectomy offers significant benefits at individual and population levels. As with many veterinary care decisions, however, there is complexity, and associated OvOb risks are not uniform across breeds. Results may facilitate more individualized recommendations for gonadectomy timing and proactive strategies (specifically diet and exercise) to mitigate risk of OvOb outcomes, while accounting for the broader context of individual dog and population-level benefits of gonadectomy.",Benka VA; Rieke K; Briggs JR,1Alliance for Contraception in Cats and Dogs; 3Independent epidemiologist,

Approximately 240,000 pigs were evaluated across 60 farms between October 2022 and July 2023. A map was created for each farm to identify individual pig location by pen/stall, room, and barn. Ten animal-based measures were assessed per pig, and the total occurrence of each measure was calculated (TOTAL). Utilizing farm maps and the same dataset, the CSIA sampling method was calculated to randomly assess a previously designated sample number of pigs per farm by location. The CSIA occurrences were then compared to TOTAL occurrences. Sow: occurrences of a body condition score of 1, severe lameness (non-weight-bearing), abscesses, open wounds, severe scratches (> 25% of the body), prolapses, vulva lesions, and shoulder sores were less for the CSIA method compared to TOTAL. Nursery: occurrences of severe lameness, abscesses, open wounds, and hernias were less for the CSIA method compared to TOTAL. Finishers: occurrences of severe lameness, abscesses, open wounds, tail bites, prolapses, and vulva lesions were less for the CSIA method compared to TOTAL. These findings suggest that the sampling method currently used in the CSIA tool does not necessarily accurately estimate the occurrence of animal-based measures at the farm level.

Previous research has demonstrated that oxidative stress and subsequent oxidative damage in the Pectoralis major muscle were predisposing factors for the development of breast muscle myopathies. More specifically, research has shown that myopathic muscle content of histidine-containing dipeptides such as carnosine that is well-known for its antioxidant properties was almost entirely depleted, exposing the muscle to oxidative stress and predisposing it to the development of myopathies. The aim of the present study was thus to investigate the effect of dietary carnosine supplementation on growth, meat yield, meat quality and the prevalence of breast muscle myopathies. To achieve this, a total of 1 080 1-day-old male Ross 308 chicks were distributed into two treatment groups in a randomized complete block design with 12 replicates per treatment. The experimental groups included a basal diet and the same basal diet supplemented with 500 mg of carnosine/kg that were fed from d 1 to d 35. The data analysis revealed that apart from a slightly lower (P = 0.03) BW at d 21 in the carnosine group compared to the control, final weight, growth and feed conversion were not influenced by the experimental diet. Similarly, carcass weight, carcass yield, yield of carcass cuts and technological quality traits of breast meat did not differ between groups. However, carnosine supplementation was associated with a reduction of the prevalence of White striping (P < 0.001), Wooden breast (P < 0.001) and the co-occurrence of these two myopathies (P < 0.001). Moreover, carnosine supplementation increased (P < 0.001) the antioxidant potential of breast muscles while malonaldehyde and carbonyl concentrations remained similar in the experimental group relative to the control group. In conclusion, carnosine supplementation provided promising results with regard to breast muscle myopathies.

The optimal MOI was 1, latent period was 4 min, and burst size was 10 PFU/cell. Whole genome sequencing revealed that it consisted of 42,960 base pairs that encoded 53 CDSs, with no lysogenic, toxin, or tRNA-associated genes detected. vB_EcoP_P64441 was classified as a new species within the family Autographiviridae, subfamily Slopekvirinae. The results of the inhibition experiments showed that vB_EcoP_P64441 had a good suppression effect on the growth of planktonic UPEC. Phage either alone or in combination with cefotaxime was effective in inhibiting biofilm formation of UPEC in vitro. Phage strongly inhibited bacterial growth on disposable rubber catheters and limited biofilm formation within 24 h.

Swine IFITM knockdown results showed that SwIFITM1a, -1b, and -2 most significantly reduced PEDV replication. By overexpressing SwIFITMs and establishing a SwIFITM-expressing Vero cell line, we identified SwIFITM2 as having the most pronounced anti-PEDV effect. SwIFITM2 inhibited PEDV entry phase. Additionally, SwIFITM2 interacted with PEDV S2 and N proteins in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, it exhibited high co-localization with caveolin-1, while demonstrating the lowest co-localization ratio with clathrin. Upon infection with PEDV, the co-localization of caveolin-1 and PEDV S2 or N protein significantly increased compared with control in the presence of SwIFITM2, indicating that SwIFITM2 may play an antiviral role by confining PEDV within caveolin-1. This study elucidates the anti-PEDV mechanisms of SwIFITMs, providing critical insights into their potential roles in viral pathogenesis and host defense.",,,lg@scau.edu.cn.

To compete for host translation resources, the porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) employs multiple strategies to suppress host protein synthesis. Mechanistically, the mRNA nuclear export and canonical translation initiation are suppressed in cells with PRRSV infection. Nsp2 was identified to induce host translation shutoff targeting the mTOR signaling pathway. Nsp2TF shares its N-terminal domains with nsp2, while nsp2N is a C-terminal truncation of nsp2. In this study, we investigated the role of nsp2-related proteins in suppressing host protein synthesis, defining their mechanistic impact on translational regulation. In a puromycin incorporation assay, the inactivation of nsp2TF and nsp2N translation attenuated the inhibitory effect of PRRSV infection on nascent peptide synthesis. PRRSV utilizes a multi-faceted approach to suppress host translation, primarily through modulation of eIF2α phosphorylation before 12 hpi and inhibition of the mTOR signaling pathway at 24 hpi. The nsp2-related proteins (nsp2, nsp2TF, and nsp2N) contribute to the modulation of the mTOR signaling pathway via divergent mechanisms. While nsp2 broadly suppresses mTOR effector proteins (4E-BP1, S6K, and rpS6), nsp2TF and nsp2N mainly downregulate the 4E-BP1 phosphorylation. The activity of mTORC1 may be regulated by additional PRRSV-encoded proteins, suggesting a coordinated viral strategy to hijack host translational machinery. This study provides novel insights into the molecular mechanisms by which nsp2-related proteins subvert host protein synthesis to facilitate viral replication.",,,007206@yzu.edu.cn.

These enzymes include several serine β-lactamases (SBLs, such as KPC) and metallo-β-lactamases (MBLs, such as NDM) that hydrolyse almost all β-lactams including carbapenems. This endeavour has successful developed some SBL inhibitors, including the boron-containing compound vaborbactam. However, the challenge posed by MBLs remains unresolved. A high-throughput screening was conducted on 1718 FDA-approved drugs as potential adjuvants to meropenem. The synergistic effect was determined by checkerboard assay. The underlying mechanisms were elucidated using enzyme inhibition assays, molecular docking and dynamics simulations. The safety and efficacy were evaluated using a murine model. We have identified another boron-containing broad-spectrum serine and metallo-β-lactamase inhibitor, the benzoxaborole antifungal agent tavaborole. In vitro, tavaborole enhances the antibacterial activity of multiple β-lactam antibiotics against bacteria producing either SBLs or MBLs.

However, no specific therapeutic agent is currently available for pneumonia induced by NiO-NPs exposure. In the present study, a cytotoxicity model was established using rat type Ⅱ alveolar epithelial cells (ACE-Ⅱ) to investigate the cellular effects of NiO-NPs, while a rat model of lung injury was developed in Wistar rats via a non-exposure tracheal instillation technique. To address this pathology, we formulated a sodium houttuyfonate (SH) nanoemulsion characterized by favorable fluidity and uniform dispersion, and evaluated its therapeutic efficacy and underlying mechanisms in NiO-NPs-induced acute lung injury through three distinct administration routes: Houttuynia cordata decoction, SH tablets and SH nanoemulsion. Concurrently, network pharmacology and transcriptomic analyses were conducted to identify key molecular targets and signaling pathways. The findings demonstrated that both Houttuynia cordata and SH significantly reduced TNF-α levels and inhibited the activation of the JAK-STAT signaling pathway both in vitro and in vivo, thereby mitigating NiO-NPs-induced pulmonary injury. Among the various formulations tested, the SH nanoemulsion exhibited the most pronounced therapeutic efficacy.

The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between serum metabolites and the intestinal microbiota in Cherry Valley broiler ducks with different finishing weights and to reveal differences in their metabolic regulation and microbial composition. Serum and cecum content samples were collected from Cherry Valley broiler ducks of different finishing weights. Metabolites were identified and compared using untargeted metabolomics, 16S rRNA gene sequencing, multivariate statistics and bioinformatics. Six key findings emerged. First, serum biochemical parameters showed that AST and ALT levels were significantly lower in the high weight group (Group H) than in the low weight group (Group L), and serum immunoglobulin IgG levels were significantly higher in group H. Second, the chorionic height to crypt depth ratio of the duodenum was significantly higher in group H than in group L. Third, the gut microbial community diversity or abundance was lower in broiler ducks in group L. Fourth, LEfSe analysis showed that the biomarker for group L was Streptococcus, whereas for group H it was Faecalibacterium. Fifth, a total of 127 differential metabolites were identified (49 up-regulated and 78 down-regulated). Finally, Spearman's correlation analysis showed that Spearman's correlation analyses showed that the Lipid-related serum metabolites were higher in low-body recombinant broiler ducks, mainly Lathosterol, Cholesterol, Cynaratriol and Leukotriene B4. In addition to lipid-associated serum metabolites in high-body recombination, The water-soluble vitamin-like metabolite Pantothenate and the antibiotic-like metabolite Tylosin were high. The cecum microbiota is strongly associated with metabolites, especially Faecalibacterium, unclassified Tannerellaceae, Subdoligranulum, Alistipes, and [Ruminococcus] torques_group, with which it exhibits strong Correlation. Broiler ducks with higher body weights have a better intestinal villous structure, enhanced digestion and absorption, higher levels of immunoglobulin secretion and superior growth performance.

This study investigated the effects of varying durations of HS on antioxidant capacity and intestinal damage in Jinding ducks. The ducks were exposed to an environment at 40°C for 1 h, 3 h, 6 h, and 12 h to simulate HS conditions. The impact of HS on intestinal health was assessed by measuring the expression of small intestinal heat shock proteins, inflammatory factors, intestinal digestive enzyme activity, intestinal permeability, and pathomorphological changes in the jejunum. The results showed that with prolonged HS, the expression of antioxidant capacity and heat shock proteins initially increased and then decreased, while intestinal inflammation and damage progressively intensified. Notably, after 12 h of HS, there was a significant increase in intestinal permeability, impaired barrier function, decreased digestive enzyme activity, pronounced disturbances in jejunal morphology, and a substantial reduction in immune cell numbers. These findings suggest that Jinding ducks subjected to 12 h of HS at 40°C can serve as a model for acute HS. This study not only elucidated the alterations in antioxidant and intestinal immunity in Jinding ducks associated with extended HS but also provided a scientifically robust experimental model for future research on anti-HS agents. The results were significant for a deeper understanding of the mechanisms through which HS affects poultry health and offered a scientific basis for developing new strategies to mitigate HS impacts.",,,zhuzhiming@faas.cn.

In this study, virus isolation, identification, and complete genome sequencing of suspected ALV-J-infected samples collected from Guangxi and Jiangsu provinces during 2022-2023 were performed. Four ALV-J strains (designated as, GXZM01, GXZM02, JSZM02, and JSZM963) were successfully isolated and sequenced, with genome lengths ranging from 7487 to 7636 bp and a homology of 82.8 %-96.5 % with the reference ALV-J strains. The amino acid sequences of the gag and pol genes of the isolated strains showed relatively high conservation, with homologies of 95-100 % and 97.1-99.5 % compared with the reference strains, respectively. Analysis of the 3'UTR revealed that the 4 ALV-J isolates show different type of mutations compared to the reference strains, with all the isolates containing a 175 bp deletion at the r-TM, while the JSZM02 strain uniquely showed a 127 bp deletion in the E element. The homology of Env protein and Gp85 protein between the 4 isolates and the reference strains ranged from 86.5 to 95.6 % and 83.7 to 93.8 %, respectively. Notably, in comparison with ALV-J prototype strain HPRS-103, we found that a distinct deletion of 11 aa located at 209-219 aa of Gp85 protein of GXZM02 strain which located at the receptor-binding domain (RBD) and partially overlapped with hypervariable region2 (hr2). Structural prediction analysis revealed that the Gp85 proteins of these ALV-J strains exhibited certain differences in the number of α-helices and β-sheets. Importantly, viral growth kinetic showed that the replication ability of GXZM02 was the weakest one among the 4 isolates, which is potentially related to the deletion in the RBD.

MPs may disrupt endocrine function, particularly affecting the thyroid gland, which is essential for metabolism and development. This study investigates the effects of PS-MPs on thyroid function in mice, offering insights relevant to veterinary care by examining changes in gene expression and biochemical markers. PS-MPs of 5 µm diameter were prepared in distilled water after probe sonication. Sixty male Swiss albino mice were divided into three groups: a control group and two treatment groups receiving 0.1 mg and 0.2 mg PS-MPs via oral gavage for 28 days. Mice were anesthetised, and thyroid tissues were collected for histopathological, biochemical, and gene expression analyses. Biochemical tests included catalase, superoxide dismutase, reactive oxygen species, and hormone levels. Histopathology and gene expression (TSHR and TPO) of thyroid-related genes were examined to assess PS-MPs induced effects. Exposure to PS-MPs in mice led to significant increases in calcium, thyroxin, free T3, free T4, ALP, AST, ALT, and amylase levels, alongside elevated oxidative stress markers. Conversely, the levels of TSH, calcitonin, magnesium and phosphate decreased. Histopathological analysis showed abnormal thyroid follicle development, decrease parafollicular cells, with colloid loss, haemorrhage, and necrosis. Gene expression analysis revealed a marked reduction in TSHR and TPO levels in PS-MPs treated groups, indicating thyroid dysfunction. These findings highlight the profound impact of PS-MPs on thyroid gland function in mice. These findings underscore the potential risks that PS-MPs pose to thyroid health, with potential consequences for other veterinary species. As environmental contamination rises, veterinarians may encounter more endocrine disorders linked to PS-MPs, emphasising the need for further research and preventive measures.",,,
40367206,Genetic analysis of stress hormone levels in hair of healthy nursery pigs and their relationships with backtest responses.,,Genetics,10.1093/genetics/iyaf092,"This study explored the genetics of the levels of stress hormones (cortisol, cortisone, DHEA, and DHEA-S) in hair of 863 clinically healthy Yorkshire x Landrace male pigs at ∼40 days of age and evaluated their potential as biomarkers of innate stress response by estimating genetic correlations with responses to a 30 s backtest performed at ∼27 days of age. Backtest responses included the number and intensity of vocalizations (VN, VI) and struggles (SN, SI). With pigs genotyped using a 50K single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) panel that was imputed to 650K SNPs, heritability estimates for the levels of cortisol, cortisone, DHEA, and DHEA-S were 0.33, 0.04, 0, and 0.31, respectively, while those for backtest responses ranged from 0.26 to 0.57. Litter effects accounted for 9 to 16% of the phenotypic variance for stress hormone levels and none for backtest responses. Genetic correlation estimates among stress hormone levels were strongest between cortisol and cortisone (0.99±0.12), while those among backtest responses ranged from 0.60 to 0.99. Cortisol was estimated to have moderate genetic correlations with VN (0.24±0.19) and VI (0.50±0.24) but not with SN and SI. Genome-wide association studies identified a major quantitative trait locus (QTL) for hair cortisol levels near the glucocorticoid receptor gene (NR3C1) that explained 45.3% of the genetic variance and that may be different than a causative mutation that was previously identified in this gene for cortisol levels in porcine blood. An extra copy of the minor allele (frequency=9%) at the lead SNP for this QTL, rs341258564 originated from both parental breeds and reduced levels of cortisol by 30±6% and of cortisone by 17±4%, and increased VN by 5±2%. Additional QTL with smaller effects (1.0 to 11.1% of genetic variance) were identified for DHEA-S, cortisol/DHEA-S, cortisone/DHEA-S, VI, and VN. Ranked gene set enrichment analyses of 0.25 Mb windows based on genetic variance explained showed that windows associated with glucocorticoid levels were enriched for biological terms related to energy production and suppression of inflammation. In contrast, those associated with DHEA-S were enriched for biological processes related to immunity activation and gene transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation. These findings establish the genetic basis of stress response in young and clinically healthy pigs, identify the genomic location of a major QTL for hair cortisol levels, and show that cortisol levels in hair of young and healthy pigs are potential genetic biomarkers for the innate coping response style of pigs to non-infectious stressors.

However, since these methods fundamentally answer different questions about wildlife distribution, the results from each modelling approach may provide different insights into species' habitat use. In this study, we leveraged data from a long-term camera trapping study in northeastern Türkiye to compare the results from occupancy and N-mixture analyses, with the main objective of understanding how the modelling approach used can influence our knowledge of species' habitat use. Specifically, we compared the habitat use preferences from N-mixture and occupancy analyses for three carnivore species with varying baseline abundances. Our results provide evidence that occupancy and N-mixture analyses provide different insights into species' sensitivity to environmental and anthropogenic factors. Whereas occupancy analysis provides a relatively broad summary of the factors that affect where a species may or may not be located on a landscape or which areas they may be more likely to use over a certain time period, N-mixture modelling may provide insights into the factors that affect the degree of use at individual sites, with particular emphasis on being able to deduce small-scale changes in habitat use across a landscape. Furthermore, while the detection probability of an occupancy analysis has been formally used as a measure of site use intensity, N-Mixture models may offer higher resolution of the quantity of use. Therefore, as these two methods tend to investigate habitat use at different spatial scales, when used in conjunction they can provide a more refined understanding of species' habitat use through repeat-survey sampling methods like camera trapping.",Çoban E,KuzeyDoğa Society,

The traditional piglet model of LCPD is limited to capturing global femoral head ischemia; thus, a new model is needed in which the extent of ischemia can be varied to replicate the spectrum of disease seen in children. In this exploratory study, we used an iterative approach to test and refine methods to bilaterally occlude vessels supplying the femoral heads in n = 8 young piglets under angiographic control. The deep and/or acetabular medial femoral circumflex arteries (DMFCA and AMFCA) were identified and embolized using either embolic particles or liquid embolic agents. The extent of ischemia was assessed immediately post-embolization (4 piglets) and/or 7 days following embolization (7 piglets) using contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (CE-MRI). After the final CE-MRI, piglets were euthanized, and their femora were harvested for histologic evaluation. Embolization of the DMFCA alone caused transient ischemia that largely resolved by 7 days with small regions of fibrovascular repair of ischemic injury remaining on histology. Embolization of both the DMFCA and AMFCA resulted in a greater degree of pathologic changes at 7 days post-operatively, but also with nearly complete restoration of femoral head perfusion. We found that combining injection of embolic particles with subsequent placement of an embolic micro-coil was the most effective approach to induce ischemic injury, which may be aided in larger piglets. While our findings should be interpreted cautiously due to the wide range in the age and size of animals investigated, they demonstrate that transarterial embolization of the vascular supply of the femoral head results in transient ischemia and histological changes consistent with partial ischemic injury. These results will inform further development of a minimally invasive piglet model of LCPD that offers a unique representation of the spectrum of pathophysiology of LCPD compared to the traditional model.",Novotny SA; Laine JC,Gillette Children's Specialty Healthcare,

A total of 430 samples, comprising 215 liver and 215 muscle samples, were collected between October 2020 and February 2021 from nine LBMs and five SMs. Samples were processed and cultured, and E. coli was isolated and identified through phenotypic and molecular techniques, including PCR targeting the uidA and uspA genes. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) was conducted using the Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion techniques with seven antibiotics from six distinct antimicrobial classes. The study found an overall prevalence of 56.28% (95% CI: 51.56-60.89) for E. coli. The prevalence in LBMs (58.33%) was higher than in SMs (54.80%), with liver samples showing a slightly higher rate of contamination (63.33% in LBMs, 55.20% in SMs) compared to muscle samples. AMR profiling revealed high resistance rates to sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim (88.84%), tetracycline (86.78%), and ampicillin (82.23%).

Group 1 served as the control group, receiving corn oil. Group 2 received LSO (3 g/kg body weight orally) for 28 days. Rats in Group 3 (FU-exposed group) received an oral administration of FU at a dosage of 16 mg/kg body weight each day for 28 days. Rats in Group 4 (Therapeutic co-treated group) were administered both LSO and subsequent FU exposure according to the previously outlined dosage regimen for 28 days. Rats in Group 5 (Protective co-treated group) received LSO seed oil for 14 days as protection then received Fu at the same mentioned doses of Fu until the end of experiment. Rats administered FU and/or LSO gained noticeably more weight than the control group. LSO significantly decreased AST and LDH levels in both the protection and treatment groups as compared to the FU-only group. It also assisted in restoring testosterone and luteinizing hormone (LH) levels that were decreased by FU, especially in the protected group. LSO also reduced kidney damage markers and normalized biomarker levels when administered with FU. The LSO-only group demonstrated normal immune response markers, similar to the control group. By changing MDA levels and increasing SOD, GSH, and TAC levels, co-treatment with LSO enhanced liver health. The control and LSO groups displayed normal spleen structure, whereas the LSO/FU group had normal seminiferous tubules with mild edema and congestion.

Sheep, the adapted hosts, rarely show pathological evidence of infection. This study describes the unusual SA-MCF lesions in a lamb, with concomitant polioencephalomalacia (PEM), bovine alphaherpesvirus 1 (BoAHV1)-associated pneumonia, and caseous lymphadenitis. A 4-month-old, male, Santa Ines sheep died after presenting clinical manifestations of a neurological syndrome suggestive of PEM. Routine post-mortem evaluations identified rib impressions on the plural surface of the lungs, pulmonary and lymph node abscesses, and marked flattening of the cerebral gyri and narrowing of the sulci. Histopathology revealed interstitial pneumonia, suppurative bacterial bronchopneumonia, pulmonary abscesses, lymphoplasmacytic interstitial nephritis, myocarditis, and hepatitis. The brain had histological evidence of PEM. Immunohistochemistry detected intralesional intracytoplasmic antigens of MCFV within epithelial cells of the lungs, liver, kidney, and small intestine. OvGHV2 DNA was amplified from the spleen, liver, kidney, and myocardium. Other common infectious disease pathogens of sheep were not detected. Accordingly, neuropathological manifestations of PEM, with concomitant caseous lymphadenitis, and infections by BoAHV1 and OvGHV2 were diagnosed. The neurological disease is hypothesized to have disrupted the normal biological functions in this lamb, while immunosuppression caused by BoAHV1 might have reactivated a latent OvGHV2 infection. Consequently, it seems that sheep may present pathological evidence of OvGHV2-induced lesions when there is a concomitant debilitating disease condition.",Bechara ASF; Pereira PFV,Large Animal Internal Medicine,selwyn.headley@uel.br.

E. coli isolates were subjected to PCR to identify the minimal predictive virulence factors, phylogenetic groups, and predictive identification of the clonal complex (CC) ST131, ST117, and ST95. The phenotypic analysis assessed the antimicrobial resistance profile. A total of 254 samples were analyzed and 60.63% (n = 154/254) were positive for E. coli, of which 35.71% (n = 55/154) were classified as APEC (60% (n = 33/55) isolated in the yolk sac of day-old chicks, 29.09% (n = 16/55) in pipped eggs and 10.91% (n = 6/55) in embryonated eggs).

However, the therapeutic efficacy of MSLN-targeted CAR T cell therapy has been limited in clinical trials for pancreatic cancer, often resulting in temporary stable disease as the best response. The heterogeneous expression of MSLN and its loss over time, along with the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME), are key factors restricting effectiveness. Oncolytic viruses are emerging cancer therapies that replicate in tumor cells and remodel the TME into an immunogenic state. Here, we engineered an oncolytic herpes simplex virus type 1 expressing human MSLN (HSV-MSLN) and evaluated its combination with MSLN-CAR T cells in a murine pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma model. In vitro, HSV-MSLN effectively induced MSLN expression on murine pancreatic cancer cells, with subsequent cell lysis. In co-culture, HSV-MSLN-infected cancer cells activated MSLN-CAR T cells, which effectively eliminated the infected cells. In vivo, HSV-MSLN delivered MSLN on the tumor cell surface and reprogrammed the TME toward an immunogenic state.

This study evaluates three E. ictaluri strains, each carrying a markerless deletion mutation in a type III or type VI secretion system gene, as candidates for a live attenuated vaccine against enteric septicemia of catfish in Channel Catfish. Replication in Channel Catfish cells, in vivo invasion and persistence, virulence, and the ability to provide single-dose protection against a wild-type E. ictaluri strain were evaluated for each mutant. In this study, three isogenic mutants were constructed that introduced deletions in esrC, eseG, and evpC. EsrC is a T3SS-encoded protein that regulates expression of multiple virulence genes, including the T3SS effector EseG and the T6SS structural protein EvpC. Each mutant strain was evaluated for its ability to replicate in Channel Catfish ovary cells and head-kidney-derived macrophage cells. Channel Catfish were also challenged with the mutant strains to evaluate if mutation affected invasion, colonization, or persistence within the head kidney, attenuated mortalities in Channel Catfish, or induced protection against disease following subsequent wild-type E. ictaluri exposure. Each mutant maintained the ability to replicate within head-kidney-derived macrophage cells and Channel Catfish ovary cells, as well as invade and colonize the head kidney. Although able to replicate intracellularly and successfully colonize catfish tissue, all three mutants were significantly attenuated in their ability to persist in tissues and cause mortality. A single immersion in mutant strains 28 d prior to exposure to wild-type E. ictaluri resulted in significantly lower mortality than fish immersed in sterile broth, with relative percent survival ranging from 95% to 100%. The findings demonstrate the potential for the development of live attenuated E. ictaluri vaccine strains through the targeted mutation of one or more E. ictaluri T3SS and T6SS genes. Edwardsiella ictaluri is an important fish pathogen with no commercially available prevention measures. This paper offers support for the use of T3SS and T6SS mutations to develop genetically characterized vaccine strains against this economically important pathogen.",,,

In this study, a blocking ELISA to specifically detect anti-RABV neutralizing antibody was developed using the purified RABV glycoprotein (G) expressed in HEK293T cells as coating antigen, and a labeled anti-G neutralizing monoclonal antibody as the blocking antibody. The overall agreement between the blocking ELISA and fluorescent antibody virus neutralization test in detection of clinical serum samples (dogs = 658; cats = 508) was 97.43% (1,136/1,166), with a diagnostic specificity of 95.63% (219/229) and a diagnostic sensitivity of 97.87% (917/937). Further comparison with the commercial ELISA kits and inter-laboratory validation showed that the blocking ELISA had excellent specificity, sensitivity, and reproducibility.

These features are associated with placental damage and fetal compromise. However, understanding of the mechanisms that lead to poor pregnancy outcome and interventions targeting excessive host responses to placental malaria are still lacking. The syncytiotrophoblast, a cell of fetal origin, is known to be responsive to malaria-infected erythrocytes as well as the malaria toxin, hemozoin, but its susceptibility to oxidative stress and how this might contribute to placental damage and dysfunction has not yet been directly investigated. The characteristics and key drivers of the syncytiotrophoblast response to oxidative stress were investigated using ex vivo human placental tissues and primary trophoblasts isolated from healthy pregnant women. Primary syncytiotrophoblast was exposed to hemozoin and tumor necrosis factor, a critical inflammatory cytokine, to model conditions found in human placental malaria. The data show remarkable lipid peroxidation in human placental samples from a malaria endemic setting and evidence of a modulated antioxidant response at the transcriptional level. Likewise, primary human syncytiotrophoblast exposed to hemozoin, tumor necrosis factor, and tumor necrosis factor combined with hemozoin in vitro exhibited increased markers of an anti-oxidative response, and, with hemozoin alone, oxidation of lipids and DNA. These results suggest that oxidative stress in syncytiotrophoblast is promoted by both hemozoin exposure and maternal inflammatory responses to placental malaria and contribute to an increased understanding of placental dysfunction and compromise in this infection.",,,

Most dogs imported into Canada must have a valid rabies vaccination certificate but do not require serological testing to confirm response to vaccination. The objective of this study was to determine the proportion of dogs with rabies antibody titres below 0.5 IU/mL in a sample of imported dogs with rabies certificates, compared to rabies antibody titres in nonimported dogs in Ontario, Canada. Serum was collected from a convenience sample of dogs imported via rescues to Ontario, within a month of arrival and before revaccination with rabies in Canada. Rabies antibody titres were measured using the rapid fluorescent foci inhibition test (RFFIT) at Kansas State University's Rabies Laboratory. Univariable logistic analysis examined demographic, vaccine and country of origin factors associated with achieving a titre of at least 0.5 IU/mL. Rabies antibody titres from nonimported dogs were obtained from the University of Guelph's Animal Health Laboratory records. Dogs tested between 2013 and 2023, using either the RFFIT or fluorescent antibody virus neutralisation (FAVN) test, were included. From October 2021 to November 2022, serum was collected from 67 dogs arriving mainly from Egypt (n = 46). In total, 48% (32/67) of these dogs had titres below 0.5 IU/mL, and this included 19 dogs that had no measurable titre. No examined factors were significantly associated with the outcome. Of the 65 nonimported dogs, 14% (9/65) had titres below 0.5 IU/mL. Rabies titres of many imported dogs were below the international standard for transboundary movement. A high proportion of dogs with unmeasurable antibodies suggests some had not been effectively vaccinated. Veterinarians should be aware of this gap and consider revaccinating imported dogs to protect both animal and public health, and to meet legal requirements of their jurisdiction. Rescues and owners should be informed that documentation does not always guarantee imported dogs have adequately responded to vaccination and to seek veterinary advice.",Anderson MEC,Ontario Ministry of Agriculture,

Using a previously established pseudovirus-based neutralization assay, we evaluated the impact of emerging hemagglutinin (HA) mutations on the efficacy of current candidate vaccine viruses (CVVs). Neutralization analysis revealed that the cow-derived H5N1 virus showed up to a 2.2-fold reduction in sensitivity compared to the CVV homologous neutralization titers. Among the 1,453 HA sequences analyzed from cow-derived H5N1 viruses, we identified four major mutations (E2K, D104G, V147M, and S336N) that emerged after the initial isolation, with 134 isolates (9.22%) harboring all four mutations. These multi-mutation variants exhibited up to a 3.3-fold reduction compared with the CVV homologous neutralization titers.

The study surveyed 205 farmers randomly selected from three regions: Unguja, Morogoro, and Dar es Salaam. Data were analysed using descriptive statistics, while negative binomial and multiple linear regression models were employed to identify factors influencing antibiotic usage patterns. A widespread use of antibiotics was revealed, with 97.1% of farmers using antibiotics for treatment, prophylaxis and/or increasing egg productivity. The most commonly used antibiotics were oxytetracycline (63%), doxycline-tylosin combination (29.8%) and enrofloxacin (22.4%). Notably, 95.6% of farmers reported that they do not observe withdrawal periods. Assessment of farmers' knowledge, attitudes, and practices yielded mean scores of 55.5%, 69.1% and 50.9% respectively. Furthermore, older adults and individuals with primary education were more likely to have higher attitude scores. Geographic location and flock size are among other factors that are likely to influence knowledge and attitudes towards antibiotic use. Higher frequency of antibiotic use was significantly associated with young adults, medium-scale farm operators, and farmers in Morogoro region (compared to the other two regions).

Genetic epidemiological investigations using whole-genome sequencing have been conducted to track the genetic evolution of ASFV. Two ASFV strains were detected in domestic pig farms in South Korea, one with a large deletion in the MGF 360-6L gene and the other in the MGF 360-21R gene. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that all Korean isolates belonged to the Asian subgroup of ASFV genotype II and were further divided into distinct subclusters of Korean African swine fever (ASF) group I. To identify the pathological changes caused by the deletion of MGF 360-6L and MGF 360-21R genes, we evaluated their pathogenicity in experimentally infected domestic pigs. No significant changes in pathogenicity were observed compared to other viruses evaluated in our previous studies. All inoculated pigs died 7-10 days post-inoculation (dpi), showing acute forms of illness with common pathological lesions. These results highlight that large genetic deletions can occur naturally in ASFV, but the deletions in MGF 360-6L and MGF 360-21R genes did not alter pathogenicity in domestic pigs.

Current models often use live animals. Epidermal organoids (keratinocytoids) are 3D miniature organs created in culture from single epidermal keratinocytes. These keratinocytoids can be used as an alternative to live animal studies to investigate epidermal structures and skin diseases. This study's objective was to compare ultrastructural morphological features of canine keratinocytoids to those features of normal epidermis. Skin and organoids had morphologically similar components, including tight junctions, desmosomes, lamellar bodies and keratin filaments. These structures were similar in both morphology and distribution. Keratinocytes in the organoids had larger and more distinct keratohyalin granules than epidermal keratinocytes and contained small amounts of glycogen. Keratinocytes from the skin showed no glycogen accumulation. Canine keratinocytoids are a useful model to study canine epidermal disease from a light microscopy and ultrastructural standpoint.",,,

There is limited efficacy data for treatment of infiltrative lipomas, and optimal fractionation strategies remain unclear. We retrospectively assessed the outcomes and prognostic factors in a cohort of dogs that underwent intensity modulated or three-dimensional conformal RT for infiltrative lipoma. Twenty-nine dogs were included from four academic institutions. The median total radiation dose prescribed and delivered was 51 Gy (range = 20-57 Gy). Dose per fraction ranged from 2.4 to 4.2 Gy, with a median of 3 Gy. Median progression-free survival (PFS) was 1483 days; the median overall survival (OS) was 1483 days. Disease progression was documented in four dogs (14%), all of which received less than 51 Gy (range = 20-50 Gy). Grade V adverse events (AEs) or secondary malignancies were recorded in six dogs (21%; two bones, one skin, one lungs, one urethra and one small intestine AE); assigned attribution was definite (n = 1), probable (n = 2), possible (n = 2) and unlikely (n = 1). Gross tumour volume (GTV) was prognostic for PFS (p < 0.01) while both GTV (p < 0.01) and total radiation dose (p < 0.01) were prognostic for OS (p < 0.01). The number of surgeries and tumour location were not associated with PFS or OS. These findings support the use of RT for long-term local control for unresectable or incompletely excised canine infiltrative lipomas.

To date, no commercial fish vaccine is available in India to protect against streptococcosis due to a lack of proper adjuvants and vaccine targets. Multiple studies justify that immunomodulators like β-glucan and Alkoxy glycerol (AKG) have improved immunity in fish. β-glucan and AKG are natural homopolymers and lipids, respectively, which have proven immunostimulant capabilities in fish and can be effectively used as a prominent adjuvant to improve vaccine efficacy. The present study aims to demonstrate the improved adjuvant efficacy of the formalin-inactivated S. agalactiae vaccine. Nile tilapia fingerlings were immunised with formalin-inactivated S. agalactiae vaccines mixed with β-glucan and AKG.

Postmortem examination is a crucial tool for identifying the underlying causes of neonatal death and improving disease diagnosis. However, the anatomical, physiological and histological differences between neonates and adults present unique challenges for necropsy procedures. Establishing a standardised neonatal necropsy protocol is essential for accurately determining the causes of death and associated diseases. This pilot study aimed to standardise a necropsy technique for canine neonates. During the examination, the spleen, heart, lungs, tongue, stomach, intestines, liver, pancreas, kidneys, bladder, brain and bones were collected from nine neonatal canines. The method involved monoblock organ removal, followed by separation on the basis of the standard organisation used in adult necropsies. Histological staining and analysis revealed structural differences between neonatal and adult tissues. Neonatal hepatocytes presented a more basophilic cytoplasm, suggesting high metabolic activity, whereas gastric glands and parietal cells were less developed, indicating ongoing maturation. Additionally, the pancreas, lungs, kidneys and spleen displayed morphological characteristics consistent with those of the early development stages. Understanding these particularities may enhance veterinary diagnostic and clinical approaches, contribute to the development of preventive measures and ultimately reduce neonatal mortality in dogs.

This study investigates the role of HMGB1 in adipocyte development and metabolism, explicitly examining its interaction with β3-adrenergic receptor-mediated lipolysis and caveolin-1 (CAV1) regulation, which may influence cardiovascular risk factors. Using 3T3-L1 preadipocytes and mouse embryonic fibroblasts, we demonstrated that HMGB1 expression increases progressively during adipogenesis, reaching peak levels in mature adipocytes. While exogenous HMGB1 treatment did not affect preadipocyte proliferation or differentiation, it inhibited lipolysis in mature adipocytes. Mechanistically, HMGB1 suppressed β3-adrenergic receptor agonist CL-316,243-induced hormone-sensitive lipase activation by reducing protein kinase A-mediated phosphorylation and attenuating extracellular signal-regulated kinase signaling without affecting upstream cyclic AMP levels. We discovered a novel regulatory mechanism wherein CAV1 physically interacts with HMGB1 in mature adipocytes, with c-Src-dependent CAV1 phosphorylation functioning as a negative regulator of HMGB1 secretion. This finding was confirmed in CAV1-deficient models, which displayed increased HMGB1 secretion and diminished lipolytic activity both in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, administering HMGB1-neutralizing antibodies to wild-type mice enhanced fasting-induced lipolysis, establishing circulating HMGB1 as a crucial antilipolytic factor.

In addition to industrial production, it is ubiquitous in high-temperature heated high-carbohydrate foods. Numerous studies have confirmed the toxicity of ACR on reproduction. Implantation and decidualization are crucial processes during the establishment of pregnancy in rodents and humans. However, its effect on uterine implantation and decidualization remains poorly understood. The objective of this study is to elucidate the mechanism by which ACR affects implantation and decidualization in mice. ACR is exposed in the daily drinking water of female mice, and the dose is calculated according to the body weight of the mice. After 3 months of administration at concentrations of 0, 20, and 30 mg ACR/kg/d, female mice are mated with male mice to induce pregnancy. Compared to the control group, ACR treatment significantly reduces the number of embryo implantations and litter size. ACR treatment leads to abnormal expression of endometrial receptivity-related molecules in the luminal epithelium on day 4 of pregnancy, including a decrease in p-STAT3 level and an increase in MUC1 and MSX1 levels. The level of decidualization-related molecules is obviously downregulated by ACR.

40362361,Effect of Diethylstilbestrol on Implantation and Decidualization in Mice.,2025-05-14,International journal of molecular sciences,10.3390/ijms26094122,"Diethylstilbestrol (DES) is a synthetic non-steroidal estrogen, which was widely used to prevent preterm birth and abortion from the 1940s to the 1970s. DES can increase the incidence of infertility, the abnormal reproductive tract, and autoimmune diseases. However, the mechanism underlying DES on early pregnancy in mice is unclear. This study evaluated the effects of DES on early pregnancy in mice, especially on uterine receptivity and decidualization. Newborn female mice were subcutaneously injected with 0.1 mg/kg DES, 1 mg/kg DES, or sesame oil as controls for 5 consecutive days. At 6 weeks old, these female mice were mated with 8-12-week-old fertile males to obtain pregnancy. The uteri of these mice were collected on days 4, 5, and 8 of pregnancy for further analysis. On days 5 and 8 of pregnancy, the number of implantation sites in 0.1 mg/kg DES group is similar to the control group, while almost no implantation sites are detected in the 1 mg/kg DES group. On day 4 of pregnancy, there was no significant difference in uterine receptive molecules between the control group and the 0.1 mg/kg DES group. However, the levels of uterine receptive molecules in the 1 mg/kg DES group are abnormal. In addition, 6 μM DES significantly inhibits mouse in vitro decidualization. The excessive activation of pyroptosis may lead to pregnancy failure. The pyroptosis-related molecules in the 1 mg/kg DES group were significantly up-regulated, suggesting that DES may contribute to pregnancy failure by over-activating pyroptosis.",,,

In this study, we discovered that restraint stress triggered the expression of Tph1, which led to 5-HT production. The 5-HT signaling then increased intestinal permeability, downregulated the expression of tight junction proteins, reduced the number of goblet cells and their ability to secrete mucin, promoted the expression of inflammatory cytokines, and ultimately damaged the intestinal mucosal barrier. Mechanistically, the 5-HT receptor HTR7 was highly expressed in the intestine. It interacted with 5-HT to initiate the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, inducing an increase in intestinal EC cells and further promoting 5-HT secretion. Additionally, the activation of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway could initiate the NF-κB signaling pathway and induce the expression of inflammatory cytokines. Blocking the 5-HT signal in mice inhibited the activation of the Wnt/β-catenin signal, thereby alleviating intestinal inflammation. Our findings revealed a novel role for 5-HT in intestinal inflammatory diseases and represent a potential new therapeutic target.",,,

Significant improvements in cardiometabolic diseases, substantially impacted by thiamine imbalances, are observed with thiamine supplementation. Diabetic patients could see a reduction in cardiovascular (CV) risk due to thiamine's significant impact on glucose metabolism. Specifically, increased ventricular filling pressures and oxygen consumption, indicative of CV dysfunction, are caused by oxidative and inflammatory damage to blood vessels, diabetic nephropathy, and elevated lactic acid production. Despite promising pre-clinical results for thiamine, clinical trials have yielded conflicting and contradictory findings due to limitations like small sample sizes and insufficient follow-up. To provide a summary of clinical study results, this systematic review assessed the impact of thiamine supplementation on diabetes and its CV complications. The studies included in this systematic review were retrieved from PubMed and Medline databases, in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement and following the Population Intervention Comparison Outcome (PICO) framework. Seven clinical studies were identified, which enlighten the association between thiamine supplementation, hyperglycemia, and cardiovascular disease (CVD). Although large-scale, multicenter studies with longer follow-up periods are needed, the association between thiamine and chronic metabolic dysfunction related to CV risk suggests its crucial role in preventing severe heart failure (HF).",,,

Eight farms that housed their dairy cows in CBPs were visited for data collection once in the warm season and once in the cold season between January and December 2023. The first visit was during hoof trimming of the herd to identify claw disorders, score lameness, and assess the bedded pack resting area. Lameness was scored again and the bedded pack resting area assessed at the second visit. To compare claw health at cow and farm levels, a cow claw score (CCS) and a farm claw score (FCS) were calculated using geometric severity scores. The prevalence of lameness at cow level was 9.4% in the cold season and 11.1% in the warm season, which were lower than values reported in studies that investigated cubicle free-stall barns. The low prevalences of lameness and claw disorders were reflected in a CCS of 8 and FCS of 9, which are defined as excellent.

Accordingly, our objective was to explore the metabolic features of VED-afflicted cows by combining the untargeted gas chromatography-time-of-flight mass spectrometry (GC-TOF-MS) and targeted liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) to identify effective serum VED biomarkers. Untargeted GC-TOF-MS analysis identified 31 differential metabolites (DMs): 20 were overexpressed and 11 were suppressed in the VED group compared to the healthy control group. These DMs were enriched in six major metabolic pathways: glycine, serine, and threonine; alanine, aspartate, and glutamate; cysteine and methionine; tyrosine; primary bile acid biosynthesis; and nitrogen metabolisms. These outcomes show that VED significantly disrupts amino acid/lipid/energy metabolism pathways in DCs. Further targeted LC-MS quantification revealed significant alterations in key metabolites, including increased levels of norepinephrine, glycine, cysteine, and L-glutamine, as well as a significant reduction in cholesterol concentrations. Binary logistic regression analysis identified norepinephrine and cholesterol as strong candidate biomarkers for VED.

Sectional imaging techniques like CT and MRI are commonly used in small mammals, but no studies have focused on rodent abdomen. This study aimed to correlate micro-CT and MRI images of the middle and caudal abdominal regions with corresponding anatomical sections in Syrian hamsters (SHs), which are popular pets and experimental models. Ten healthy male SHs were used, and anatomical structures from frozen sections were compared with corresponding MCT and MRI images. Clinically relevant structures identified in anatomical sections were discernible on MCT and MRI scans. The key findings include the presence of glandular and non-glandular stomachs, the stomach and cecum primarily located on the left side, the absence of ampulla coli, sacculus rotundus, and cecal appendix, and sacculation of the colon, as well as the jejunum, mainly on the right side. The vesicular, coagulating, and prostate glands were also present, and the right kidney did not extend to the last thoracic vertebra. The results were similar to abdominal anatomical and radiologic studies in rats, mice, and guinea pigs, regardless of the rat's and mice's sacculated cecum and the guinea pig's glandular stomach.

In cats, as in dogs, no feto-maternal signaling leading to establishment of pregnancy is known. But as opposed to dogs, the placenta is a source of steroid hormones and corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH). Scarce information is available on physiological mechanisms at the uterine level during early gestation; more studies are needed on lymphocyte subsets, feto-maternal crosstalk and other mechanisms leading to local immunosuppression, allograft acceptance and embryo nidation and invasion. Recent studies investigate the function of extracellular vesicles (EVs); however, there is no study on embryo- or endometrium-derived EV. During pregnancy, anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) serum concentrations were found to be higher than in non-pregnant cats, and a recent study found that supraphysiological levels may lead to pregnancy loss; the function of AMH during pregnancy warrants investigation. Most information is available on corpus luteum development and function, showing some similarities to dogs. Some information on maintenance of feline pregnancy was obtained by ovariectomy (OE) or the use of endocrine disruptors, showing that OE does not lead to pregnancy loss in all cases, especially when performed after day 35; the variable effect is still not fully understood. Antiprogesterone, dopamine agonists and prostaglandins were used in different dosages and treatment schemes and showed variable effect during the second half of gestation, highlighting progesterone and prolactin as key hormones for the maintenance of gestation. Some events during early gestation are comparable with the canine species, even though they appear earlier, like the entrance of the zygote into the uterus and implantation; however, significant differences are present concerning the histomorphology of the placenta and, in a few cases, even the gross morphology as in some cats, where the zonary placenta does not completely surround the fetus.

Using the telovelar approach, the tumor was partially excised, contrary to the goal of complete removal. Histopathological analysis confirmed the diagnosis of glioma. By the third postoperative day, the patient began to walk independently, and tetra-ataxia symptoms gradually decreased. Postoperative imaging confirmed the successful debulking of the tumor. By postoperative day 15, the patient showed normal gait, and adjuvant radiation therapy (RT) was initiated 2 weeks later. Unfortunately, the patient died 91 days after surgery, though the precise cause of death remains undetermined.",,,
40362054,Serum Amyloid A Concentrations in Young Japanese Black Cattle: Relationship with Colostrum Intake and Establishing Cut-Off Concentrations.,,Animals : an open access journal from MDPI,10.3390/ani15091239,"This study aimed to investigate the variations in serum amyloid A (SAA) concentrations and influencing factors in young Japanese Black (JB) cattle. The cut-off values were 18.5 mg/L, 17.7 mg/L, 14.4 mg/L, and 8.1 mg/L at 30-59, 60-89, 90-119, and 120-300 days of age, respectively. Calves that ingested colostrum had significantly higher SAA concentrations than those that did not. The SAA concentrations at 1-7 days of age showed no correlation with γ-glutamyltransferase, total protein, or globulin levels. A slight increase in mammary-associated amyloid A concentrations-a colostrum-derived SAA-was observed before and after colostrum intake on 1 day of age; however, a significant overall increase in SAA concentrations was noted. The reference values for the SAA concentration in 1-month-old calves also showed a gradual decline. These findings suggest that the elevated SAA concentrations in 1-month-old JB calves, similar to Holstein calves, are not due to absorption from colostrum but SAA is instead biosynthesized by the calves as a biological defense mechanism. The clinical application of SAA concentrations in JB calves after one month of age may contribute to improving calf productivity.",Shinya U; Iwamura Y; Kato T; Hamada Y; Widodo OS; Takagi M,Soo Veterinary Clinic; Division of Animal Husbandry,

Although cementless techniques have become the standard owing to concerns regarding the aseptic loosening of cemented implants, complications such as stem fractures can still occur. This study reports a case of a 1-year-old, 2.8 kg Toy Poodle that underwent cementless THR using the Zurich mini-cementless hip system to treat Legg-Calvé-Perthes disease. Six months post-surgery, the dog developed a fractured stem, and a second surgery was performed using the ""window technique"" to replace the broken stem. The procedure involved creating a small window in the femoral cortex to remove the damaged stem and insert a new one. The dog recovered successfully with no further lameness. This case highlights the effectiveness of the window technique for stem replacement in small dogs and emphasizes the importance of optimal stem selection and positioning during the initial THR.",,,

This systematic review was conducted to compile the types of reproductive failures and their underlying causes reported in smallholder pig farms from East and Southeast Asia and to identify relevant knowledge gaps. Following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, 26 peer-reviewed studies met the eligibility criteria and were included in our synthesis. These studies were conducted in 11 countries, with Vietnam, China, and Thailand representing the highest share (53.8%). Only six studies (23%) investigated reproductive failure as their primary objective. Stillbirth, mummification, late-term abortion, and weak-born piglets were the predominant reproductive failures reported from smallholder pig farms across the region. The most frequently cited viral pathogens associated with these failures were porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) and porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV-2). Common non-infectious risk factors included extreme climate conditions (e.g., heat stress), poor diet and housing, and suboptimal boar management. Our synthesis highlighted a dearth of research focused on reproductive failure in smallholder pig farms in the region and emphasised the need for more targeted studies to clarify the biological, environmental, and managerial risk factors contributing to reproductive failure. This will facilitate the development of targeted prevention and control measures that account for the unique farming conditions and challenges smallholder farms face in East and Southeast Asia.",Ho J,Agriculture,

These countries are consistent with Esping-Andersen's three welfare state models and actively implement animal welfare policies. This study addresses the limitations of previous studies that focused primarily on animal-related discourses by examining the characteristics of different policy types that integrate two core components of animal welfare policy: animal welfare law and animal welfare systems. This analysis identified four types of animal welfare policies: (1) economic value type (South Korea and the USA); (2) social value type (the UK); (3) rights extension type (Denmark, Germany, and Sweden); and (4) ecological type (Austria). The results show that welfare state animal welfare policies are generally consistent with the ideological characteristics of the welfare system in question.

These in vitro models facilitate the study of digestion, enable disease and host-pathogen interaction modeling, and allow for the investigation of nutrient absorption, microbiota, and pharmacokinetics. Considering the One Health concept, the application of gastrointestinal tract systems in investigations for animals can clearly reflect human health, and thus, it is pointing to the relevance of the adaptation of already existing models and the development of new models to meet the needs of veterinary and animal farming practices. This review explores and compares the various types of gastrointestinal tract models, including static and dynamic systems, and their applications across different animal species. Specific technical and methodological considerations are discussed for core animal-developed and -tested artificial systems and their integration with common 'omics' techniques.

Mastectomy leads to moderate to severe pain. Effective pain management is crucial in veterinary medicine. This review outlines analgesic techniques for managing perioperative pain in dogs undergoing mastectomy. A literature search on dog mastectomy analgesia was conducted from January 2001 to January 2025. Pre-emptive meloxicam reduces postoperative cardiovascular changes without affecting renal function. When combined with gabapentin, it lowers the need for rescue analgesic opioids, similar to robenacoxib. With regard to tramadol, it offers contrasting analgesia in the studies considered when used alone, while its effect appears enhanced when used in combination with meloxicam/dipyrone. However, methadone provides superior pain control, especially when given preoperatively or intraoperatively. The combination of ketamine, lidocaine, and maropitant enhances pain management, while fentanyl, alone or with lidocaine and ketamine, is effective for intraoperative pain control.

40362019,Assessment of Oxidative Stress and Associated Biomarkers in Wild Avian Species.,,Animals : an open access journal from MDPI,10.3390/ani15091203,"Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are natural by-products of cellular metabolism and are also formed in response to environmental stressors such as pollution, extreme temperatures, and ultraviolet radiation exposure. Physiological factors such as intense activity, growth, reproduction, nutrient deficiency, captivity, and disease also contribute to ROS production. While ROS, including free radicals, play a key role in cell physiology, including immune defense, their excessive accumulation can damage cellular components and cause oxidative stress when antioxidant defenses are overwhelmed. To regulate ROS levels, wild birds rely on enzymatic (e.g., catalase, superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase) and non-enzymatic antioxidants (e.g., vitamins C and E, carotenoids). Oxidative stress affects important aspects of wild bird biology, including health, reproduction, and survival, and is closely linked to overall fitness. It is also linked to physiological challenges such as migration and the progression of various diseases affecting wild bird populations. The study of oxidative stress in wild birds requires the use of appropriate biomarkers to assess its role in disease development. A deeper understanding of the balance between ROS production and antioxidant defenses is essential to determine how wild birds cope with environmental and physiological challenges. In this review, we summarize the mechanisms of oxidative stress in wild birds and the role of antioxidants in maintaining health and promoting longevity in wild bird populations.",,,

Its origins trace back to China, from where it spread across Asia and Europe before reaching the modern global market. The fermentation of kombucha is mediated by a Symbiotic Culture of Bacteria and Yeasts (SCOBY), comprising yeasts, acetic acid bacteria, and lactic acid bacteria. The microbial consortium plays a crucial role in the production of organic acids and bioactive metabolites, shaping the sensory characteristics of the beverage. Given the growing interest in kombucha as a functional beverage, this study aims to explore its historical background, fermentation process, and microbiological composition, including key yeasts, acid acetic bacteria, and lactic acid bacteria and their interactions. Additionally, we describe the potential health effects of kombucha, particularly its antimicrobial and antioxidant activity, the probiotic potential of the strains associated with kombucha, and safety considerations while also addressing the risks associated with its consumption. Although several studies suggested that kombucha may have antioxidants, antimicrobial, and probiotic properties, as well as contribute to gut microbiota regulation and immune system support, there is significant variability in the composition of the beverage, especially in artisanal preparations. This variability poses challenges in standardizing its potential effects and ensuring consistent safety. The risk of contamination further underscores the importance of adhering to strict sanitary production standards.

However, the metabolic demands of immune cells within the tumor microenvironment (TME) are less commonly discussed despite their critical role in shaping the immune response. In this review, we explored the intricate interplay between immunometabolism and innate immunity cells in gastrointestinal cancers. We focused on how metabolic pathways, including glycolysis, fatty acid oxidation, and amino acid metabolism, drive the immunosuppressive functions of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) and tumor-associated neutrophils (TANs), tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) and innate lymphocyte subsets such as NK cells. These cells contribute to a hostile immune landscape, supporting tumor growth and evasion from immune surveillance in a phenomenon of tumor-derived immunosuppression. Additionally, we investigated the influence of dietary interventions on the metabolic reprogramming of these immune cells, highlighting how nutrition can modulate the TME. Finally, we discussed emerging therapeutic strategies that target metabolic vulnerabilities in MDSCs, TANs, NK cells, and monocytes, offering a novel avenue for enhancing antitumor immunity. By dissecting these mechanisms, we aim to provide insights into how metabolic pathways can be harnessed to improve cancer treatment outcomes. This review underscores the importance of understanding immunometabolism not only as a driver of immune suppression but also as a potential therapeutic target in gastrointestinal cancer.",,,

A structured questionnaire was used in this study to collect data about sociodemographic data, medical history, lifestyle habits, and functional status, as well as nutritional status, which was assessed using 4 components (anthropometric measurements, biochemical data, clinical data, and dietary data). Patients' reports were reviewed to obtain laboratory values. The malnutrition-inflammation score was used to assess the prevalence of malnutrition. Data were analyzed using univariate and multivariate analysis. A total of 188 hemodialysis patients participated in the study. The mean age was 57.8 ± 14.0 years, ranging from 19 to 86 years old. Females were more likely to experience nausea and headache during hemodialysis than men (p < 0.05). The findings also showed that the MIS score was significantly higher in women than in men.

Numerous algorithms have been developed to eliminate these errors and consolidate the output into distance-based Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) or denoising-based Amplicon Sequence Variants (ASVs). An objective comparison between them has been obscured by various experimental setups and parameters. In the present study, we conducted a comprehensive benchmarking analysis of the error rates, microbial composition, over-merging/over-splitting of reference sequences, and diversity analyses using the most complex mock community, comprising 227 bacterial strains and the Mockrobiota database. Using unified preprocessing steps, we were able to compare DADA2, Deblur, MED, UNOISE3, UPARSE, DGC (Distance-based Greedy Clustering), AN (Average Neighborhood), and Opticlust objectively. ASV algorithms-led by DADA2- resulted in having a consistent output, yet suffered from over-splitting, while OTU algorithms-led by UPARSE-achieved clusters with lower errors, yet with more over-merging. Notably, UPARSE and DADA2 showed the closest resemblance to the intended microbial community, especially when considering measures for alpha and beta diversity. Our unbiased comparative evaluation examined the performance of eight algorithms dedicated to the analysis of 16S rRNA amplicon sequences with a wide range of mock datasets. Our analysis shed light on the pros and cons of each algorithm and the accuracy of the produced OTUs or ASVs.

Inclusion criteria were observational studies reporting KAP data among HCWs related to AMR. Study quality was assessed using the Joanna Briggs Institute critical appraisal checklist. Statistical analyses, including heterogeneity (I² statistic, Cochran Q), were conducted using STATA version 14. Random-effects models were applied for pooled estimates, and subgroup analyses, meta-regression, and sensitivity analyses were performed. Publication bias was assessed via Egger's test and adjusted using the trim-and-fill method. Geographical distribution was analyzed with ArcGIS 10.3 software, and evidence certainty was evaluated using the GRADE framework. A meta-analysis of 108 studies involving 29,433 HCWs assessed their knowledge of AMR. Additionally, 51 studies with 13,660 HCWs evaluated attitudes, and 43 studies with 10,569 HCWs examined practices regarding AMR. The pooled proportion of HCWs with good knowledge of AMR was 56.5% (95% CI: 50.4-62.6%, I² = 99.5%), with the highest prevalence in Europe (70.3%) and the lowest in the Western Pacific (45.9%). Positive attitudes towards AMR were reported in 60.4% (95% CI: 48.5-72.3%, I² = 99.8%), with the highest prevalence in the Eastern Mediterranean Region (64.5%) and among those with less than five years of experience (77.8%). Good practices were observed in 48.5% (95% CI: 36.5-60.5%, I² = 99.7%), with the highest adherence in Europe (56.6%) and the lowest in Africa (39.1%). Subgroup analysis revealed that younger HCWs (under 30 years) showed better KAP scores across all domains. The findings underscore the need for targeted interventions to enhance the knowledge, attitudes, and practices of HCWs regarding AMR. Priority should be given to designing and implementing robust training programs tailored to the specific needs of HCWs in resource-constrained settings. Strengthening AMR-related education and practice among HCWs is crucial for combating the global AMR crisis effectively.",Rahmanian V,Department of Public Health,vahid.rahmani1392@gmail.com.
40361226,"The role of sex differences in cardiovascular, metabolic, and immune functions in health and disease: a review for ""Sex Differences in Health Awareness Day"".",2025-05-14,Biology of sex differences,10.1186/s13293-025-00714-7,"Sexual dimorphism is a fundamental characteristic of the anatomy and physiology of animals and humans, yet biomedical research has largely ignored these phenomena in the study of health and disease, despite early studies in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries that demonstrated the importance of sex differences. With the explosive growth of biomedical research following World War II, especially in the 1970s through the 1990s, preclinical and clinical studies led to a greater recognition of sex differences in physiological function, particularly the significant disparities in the incidence of and mortality from cardiovascular diseases, which generally occur more frequently in men than in premenopausal women. There is a growing awareness that metabolic and immune dysfunction are intimately tied to the development of cardiovascular diseases. Thus, this review article focuses on sexual dimorphism in cardiovascular, metabolic, and immune function in health and disease, and was prepared for the journal Biology of Sex Differences as part of its recognition of ""Sex Differences in Health Awareness Day."" This article clearly reveals the striking importance of sex differences in cardiovascular, metabolic, and immune system functions in health and in the pathogenesis of disease processes, which likely involve a combination of effects of the sex chromosomes as well as the gonadal steroid hormones. In the developing fetus, fetal sex clearly influences the pathogenesis of the hypertensive diseases of pregnancy, and sex differences in the effects of the fetus continue beyond pregnancy and appear to influence the future risk of maternal cardiometabolic diseases. Similarly, there is strong evidence of many clinically-relevant sexually dimorphic characteristics of obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus which appear to involve both chromosomal and humoral effects, although the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms are poorly understood. The gonadal steroid hormones (both androgens and estrogens) are known to exert important effects on the regulation of intermediary metabolism; however, recent studies reveal the emerging importance of these hormones in the regulation of inflammation. For example, menopausal declines in estrogen are associated with increases in inflammatory markers and the development of heart failure in women. Similar effects on inflammatory function may also occur in men with progressive age-dependent declines in testosterone. Declines in androgen levels in men are also associated with detrimental effects on cardiovascular and metabolic function, especially the development of metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes, important risk factors for cardiovascular disease. Interestingly, pathophysiological increases in the normally lower testosterone levels in women are associated with the same detrimental effects on cardiovascular and metabolic function, revealing striking bi-directional sex differences in the effects of the androgens. Finally, it is increasingly apparent that the kidney plays an important role in the regulation of sex steroid hormone levels, and the declines in both estrogen and testosterone that occur with chronic kidney disease appear to play an important role in the linkage between chronic kidney disease and the development of cardiovascular disease. In conclusion. It is clear that sex differences in cardiovascular, metabolic, and immune function play important roles in health and in the pathogenesis of disease. Elucidation of the chromosomal and humoral mechanisms underlying sexual dimorphism in physiological functions will play important roles in the future development of age- and sex-specific prevention and pharmacotherapy of disease processes.",,,john-n-stallone@tamu.edu.

The resulting inflammation causes additional harm to the affected tissues. This study aimed to investigate the relationship between pro-inflammatory cytokines Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF-α) and interleukin (IL-6) levels in Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and the neurological form of distemper disease in dogs. The study included 23 CDV-infected dogs with neurological signs, 10 diseased but CDV-negative (non-infected) dogs, and 12 healthy controls. CSF samples were analyzed using Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) for CDV sequences and the sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) method for quantifying IL-6 and TNF-α levels. While a significant increase in CSF cytokine levels was observed between the CDV-infected and healthy controls, no significant differences were detected between the CDV-infected and non-infected diseased groups. The elevated levels of IL-6 and TNF-α in the CSF of dogs with nervous distemper suggest their involvement in disease pathogenesis. However, their lack of specificity limits their use as reliable diagnostic biomarkers for distinguishing nervous distemper from other neurological conditions in dogs. Further research is needed to identify more accurate and specific biomarkers for the precise diagnosis and effective management of CDV infection.",,,mohebalian@um.ac.ir.
40361088,Decolonizing medical education: a systematic review of educational language barriers in countries using foreign languages for instruction.,2025-05-14,BMC medical education,10.1186/s12909-025-07251-2,"Language barriers in medical education, particularly in countries where foreign languages are used as the medium of instruction, pose significant challenges for domestic medical students. These barriers hinder academic performance, comprehension, and communication with patients, ultimately impacting the quality of healthcare delivery. Despite the prevalence of this issue, a comprehensive understanding of its effects remains underexplored. This systematic review aims to synthesize evidence on language barriers in medical education and propose strategies to address them. Following PRISMA guidelines, we conducted a systematic review of studies published up to March 21, 2024, using PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science. Eligible studies focused on language barriers faced by medical, pharmacy, nursing, dental, or veterinary students in countries relying on foreign-language-based medical education. Data extraction included study characteristics, reported language barriers, and their impact on education and patient communication. Quality assessment was performed using the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool. From 5,410 citations, 49 studies involving over 14,500 students met the inclusion criteria. Most studies (n = 32) were conducted in Arab countries, with 15 in Saudi Arabia. Two key themes emerged: (1) Education and Academic Performance: Students frequently reported difficulties comprehending foreign-language textbooks, lectures, and assessments, leading to poor academic outcomes, increased stress, and higher dropout rates. (2) Communication Skills with Patients: Studying and training in a foreign language hindered students' ability to communicate effectively with patients in their native language, impacting empathy, medical history collection, and overall patient care. Many studies highlighted students felt more confident and effective when using their native language during clinical interactions. Language barriers in foreign-language-based medical education significantly impede students' academic performance and patient communication skills. Addressing these challenges through reforms, such as integrating native language instruction and supplemental language training, is crucial to enhancing medical education quality and ensuring effective healthcare delivery. Future research should explore innovative solutions, including bilingual education and AI-driven translation tools, to bridge these gaps.",,,abdullah.hamad744@gmail.com.

Our objective was to evaluate the detection of SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) in WTD serum, plus two additional WTD biological sample types, using a blocking ELISA previously used for WTD serum. The two additional sample types evaluated were eluted Nobuto filter-paper strips (FPSs) from heparinized whole blood collected perimortem from 34 WTD and serosanguinous fluid collected postmortem from the thoracic cavity of 34 WTD.

Horses also underwent an objective lameness examination and were included if they had a hindlimb impact lameness (Pmin ≥ 3 mm), which positively responded (≥ 50%) to the tarsometatarsal and centrodistal joints' anesthetic block. Horses randomly received an intra-articular injection of BoNT-A or an equivalent volume of saline solution. Horses were reevaluated at postinjection days (PIDs) 1, 7, 15, 30, 60, 90, 120, 150, and 180. Success criteria included a decrease in Pmin (≤ 3 mm) or an abolishment of lameness on the baseline lame limb with lameness shifting to the contralateral limb. A percentage of lameness improvement was calculated for all horses at all timepoints. 5 horses were included in the BoNT-A group, whereas 4 individuals were allocated in the placebo group. A significant improvement (P < .05) was observed in horses from the BoNT-A group when compared to placebo at PIDs 90, 120, 150, and 180. Two of 5 horses (40%) from the BoNT-A group had an absolute improvement (100%) in lameness at all the timepoints. Higher percentages of lameness improvement were observed at PID 60. The results of this study suggest that the intra-articular injection with 50 U of BoNT-A was effective in reducing lameness in horses with distal tarsal osteoarthritis, mainly 90 days after injection.

40359924,Differential Virulence and Host-Specific Fitness of Regionally Distinct Human-Derived Powassan Virus Lineage 2 Strains.,,The American journal of tropical medicine and hygiene,10.4269/ajtmh.24-0776,"Powassan virus (POWV; family Flaviviridae) is a tick-borne encephalitic virus endemic to Canada, the United States, and Russia. In the United States, POWV is transmitted by ixodid ticks, and transmission foci reflect the geographic range of these vectors, primarily Ixodes scapularis. Thus, northeastern and midwestern regions of the United States contain the highest human case burdens and prevalence of infected ticks. Notably, New York (NY) and Minnesota (MN) have a long history of POWV transmission to humans. Over time, genetic divergence has occurred in these regions, giving rise to distinct midwestern and northeastern clades. Despite the established circulation of POWV, increases in reported human cases, and documented genetic distinction, an understanding of strain-specific POWV virulence is limited because of the lack of human isolates. In 2020 and 2021, two POWV strains were isolated from fatal human cases from MN (deer tick virus [DTV] MN-PV320) and NY (DTV NY21-027). Here, we provide the first characterization of geographically distinct, contemporary, human POWV isolates. Comprehensive genetic characterization was completed and phenotypic variability was determined in vitro and in vivo . Although strain fitness was similar in I. scapularis, higher mortality rates were measured in a susceptible POWV mouse model after infection with DTV NY21-027 compared with DTV MN-PV320. Genetic analysis revealed several variable amino acid substitutions, including I2173L in DTV NY21-027, which was selected for in all strains after neurological infection. These data suggest that genetic divergence of POWV strains from regionally distinct transmission foci could contribute to strain-dependent pathogenic potential in humans.",White JL,Bureau of Communicable Disease Control,

MM is a malignant plasma cell neoplasm, accounting for less than 1 % of canine malignant tumors, primarily affecting the axial skeleton with osteolytic lesions. Infiltrative lipomas can invade adjacent tissues, including the spinal canal, leading to neurological deficits. This study describes a case of tumor collision between MM and infiltrative lipoma in the spine of a 14-year-old mixed-breed dog with a three-month history of lumbosacral swelling and progressive neurological deficits, emphasizing the importance of a thorough diagnostic approach for effective treatment. Myelography revealed extensive osteolysis of the fourth, fifth and sixth lumbar vertebrae, along with a sudden contrast interruption and a filling defect at L6, prompting surgical intervention for tumor excision and cauda equina decompression. During surgery, meticulous tissue sampling from the subcutaneous layer to the epidural fat enabled histopathological identification of MM infiltrating beyond L6 and coexisting with an infiltrative lipoma. MM was confirmed by monoclonal gammopathy detected via serum protein electrophoresis. Following diagnosis, treatment with melphalan and prednisone resulted in pain resolution and reduced serum gamma globulin levels. After 925 days of follow-up, the dog remains clinically stable with no recurrence of clinical signs. This case underscores the critical role of accurate diagnosis in identifying tumor collisions, guiding targeted treatment, and improving survival outcomes.",,,dvbeckmann@hotmail.com.

The freezing/thawing process resulted in reduced semen quality parameters. Viability and motility decreased threefold (90.6 %-31.2 % and 76.0 %-26.7 %, respectively), while the proportion of live spermatozoa with intact mitochondrial membrane potential decreased fivefold (54.9 %-11.4 %). Additionally, oxidative stress increased sevenfold (10.5 %-68.8 %). A total of 146 differentially abundant protein spots were found between fresh and frozen/thawed spermatozoa, while 27 spots differentiated between fresh and frozen/thawed ECF. Immunofluorescence staining showed reduced signals of mitochondrial proteins, such as aconitate hydratase, alpha-enolase, glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, and triosephosphate isomerase, in the spermatozoa midpiece, as well as reduced signals of acrosin in the acrosome. Freezing/thawing affected mitochondrial energy metabolism, particularly the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and oxidative phosphorylation. The maintenance of an acetyl-CoA pool to sustain TCA cycle activity in cryopreserved spermatozoa may be insufficient owing to disturbances in fatty acid beta-oxidation and/or aerobic glycolysis. Changes in the ECF primarily reflect the leakage of spermatozoa glycolytic enzymes. The freezing/thawing process alters motile cilium assembly, primarily affecting the spermatozoa axoneme and outer dense fibres. The initial step of fertilization may be disrupted by alterations in proteins involved in spermatozoa binding to the ovum.

The findings indicated that vaccinated pigs exhibited significantly lower risks of mortality (RR = 0.30, 95 % CI: 0.24-0.39), fever (RR = 0.46, 95 % CI: 0.38-0.56), and clinical signs (RR = 0.34, 95 % CI: 0.27-0.43), compared to unvaccinated controls, corresponding to vaccine efficacies (VE) of 70 %, 54 %, and 66 %, respectively. Although this marks significant progress toward ASF control through vaccination, the presence of significant side effects in some vaccinated pigs, such as fever (RD = 0.24, 95 % CI: 0.15-0.34) and clinical reactions (RD = 0.11, 95 % CI: 0.05-0.18) indicates that current vaccine candidates require further refinement to achieve the level of safety and protection needed for field application. Subgroup analysis revealed that homologous recombination technology is the most effective attenuation strategy, with gene deletion mutants derived from virulent strains achieving a VE of 73 % against mortality, 70 % against clinical signs, and 55 % against fever. Moreover, the efficacy and safety of LAVs are strongly influenced by the viral strain used as the vaccine backbone and the challenge strain used. A more comprehensive understanding of the antigenic, pathogenic, and immunogenic variations among ASF virus strains is crucial for the development of an effective and safe vaccine.",,,gywon@jbnu.ac.kr.

While local EIAV prevalence has been estimated in several studies, no global prevalence has been determined. Thus, this study aimed to review the literature on EIAV prevalence in the 21st century. A comprehensive electronic search was conducted in PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, Google Scholar, SciELO.org, African Journals Online, and NZresearch.org, yielding 105 articles published between January 1st, 2000, and December 31st, 2024 (spanning 24 years). EIAV prevalence was estimated in 42 countries and is particularly high in Mexico (North America; 27.14 % [95 % CI, 25.11 - 29.17]) and Guatemala (Central America; 15.9 % [95 % CI, 9.66 - 22.14]). While EIAV prevalence in the United States of America (USA) remains low and stable over time, the relatively elevated prevalence in the Southern states, along with their extensive border with Mexico, places these areas at a higher risk. EIAV prevalence estimated per province/state in the USA, Argentina, and Brazil, indicated higher rates in humid and warmer regions. EIAV has a low presence in the Middle East, while the scarcity of epidemiological studies in Africa and Oceania complicates the estimation of EIAV prevalence in these regions. These findings highlight the need for continued intensive surveillance in both high-risk regions and areas lacking data. Given that insect vectors are the primary natural transmission route, global warming may lead to increased vector movement into temperate areas, potentially contributing to a surge in EIAV infections.",Reis JKPD; Vissani MA; Barrandeguy ME,Instituto Nacional de Investigación Agropecuaria (INIA); Laboratório de Retroviroses; Instituto de Virología,cthieulent@lsu.edu.
40359781,Senecavirus A nonstructural protein 3A Inhibits Ago2-mediated RNAi antiviral response.,,Veterinary microbiology,10.1016/j.vetmic.2025.110547,"Senecavirus A (SVA) can infect pigs of all ages and poses a significant risk to the swine industry. RNA interference (RNAi) is a conserved antiviral immune defense pathway in eukaryotes, and many viruses have been proven to encode viral proteins as viral RNAi suppressors (VSRs) to evade RNAi-mediated antiviral response. However, it is unclear whether SVA regulates RNAi for its infection and replication. In this study, it is found that SVA nonstructural protein 3 A has a VSR function. Mechanistically, 3 A effectively inhibited double-stranded RNA and small interfering RNA-induced RNAi, degrading Argonaute2 (Ago2) through autophagy. This paper demonstrated that SVA encoded 3 A as VSR to resist RNAi pathway, escaping host immunity and promoting viral replication, which expands the understanding of the interaction between SVA and its host.",,,zyh7125@163.com.
40359780,Maternal vaccination partially protects piglets against influenza A virus associated alteration of the microbiome and hippocampal gene expression.,,Veterinary microbiology,10.1016/j.vetmic.2025.110544,"Influenza A virus (IAV) causes respiratory disease with systemic complications in a variety of avian and mammalian hosts, including humans and pigs. Infection with IAV in newborns can be particularly damaging as viral infection is known to disrupt the rapid developmental processes that occur during this period. Maternal IAV vaccination can reduce the risk of IAV infection in infants, but it is unknown whether passive transfer of anti-IAV antibodies protect against the downstream complications of infection. In this study, we evaluated the impact of maternal vaccination on the gut and nasal microbiota development and hippocampal transcriptome in neonatal piglets infected with influenza A virus. Sows were either vaccinated with an experimental influenza A vaccine at 70- and 90-days gestation, or mock-vaccinated with PBS. Neonatal piglets born from vaccinated and unvaccinated sows were challenged with a pathogenic IAV isolate or mock-challenged with PBS at 6 days post-farrowing and euthanized five days post challenge. Vaccination significantly reduced lung lesions and infectious viral load in piglets. Nasal and gut microbial community development was also partially protected from viral disruption as indicated by increased deviation from pre-challenge timepoints compared to animals challenged with the virus from unvaccinated mothers. Bulk RNA sequencing of hippocampal tissue identified 1146 differentially expressed genes (FDR < 0.05) between groups. IAV-infected piglets from vaccinated sows showed increases in genes related to viral immune responses, while IAV-infected piglets from unvaccinated sows showed increases in genes related to neurogenesis and decreases in genes related to vascular development. Many of these differentially regulated genes were strongly correlated with microbial community abundances, indicating that the microbiota may contribute to IAV outcomes. Notably, nasal microbial abundances intricately connected with hippocampal gene expression patterns, suggesting a strong nasal microbiome-brain communication axis in early development. Together, our results indicate that maternal vaccination partially protects neonatal piglets against influenza virus infection and mitigates the potential long-term impacts of IAV infection on the microbiome and cognition.",,,cgaulke@illinois.edu.
40359755,TBBPA induced hepatocyte ferroptosis by PCBP1-mediated ferritinophagy.,,Journal of hazardous materials,10.1016/j.jhazmat.2025.138515,"Tetrabromobisphenol A (TBBPA) is the most widely used brominated flame retardant and has been identified as emerging widespread pollutants. Ferroptosis, a recently characterized form of iron-dependent cell death, is related to a wide range of liver diseases. Ferritinophagy as a novel selective form of autophagy functions in iron processing is essential to induce ferroptosis. Poly(rC)-binding protein 1 (PCBP1) is an iron chaperone involved in iron loading to ferritin. Nevertheless, the potential health risk caused by TBBPA in mammals is unknown. Thus, this study is conducted to explore the molecular mechanism of TBBPA-induced liver injury and the unique role of PCBP1 in it. In this study, we found that TBBPA exposure caused hepatic pathological injury and hepatocyte mitochondrial morphological changes, such as decreased or absent mitochondrial crest, ruptured mitochondrial membranes and mitochondrial shrinkage. The result showed that TBBPA exposure exacerbated glutathione depletion and lipid peroxidation, which are hallmarks of ferroptosis. Consistent with the results in vivo, TBBPA exposure activated ferritinophagy and upregulated indicators related to ferroptosis in hepatocytes. Of note, overexpression of PCBP1 inhibited TBBPA-induced ferroptosis by reducing overstimulated ferritinophagy. Here, we uncover a new mechanism whereby TBBPA triggers hepatocyte ferroptosis through the activation of ferritinophagy. Of note, we identify PCBP1 as critical for liver iron homeostasis, link this molecule to liver disease. Taken together, our findings provide a new therapeutic strategy and potential target for the treatment of liver disease.",,,zhaoyi@neau.edu.cn.

They offer the potential to treat cancers for which effective systemic therapies are lacking, including canine malignant melanoma (CMM). In this study, we investigate the suitability of eight canine orthologs of human CTAs as targets for immunotherapy, including cancer-associated gene 1 (CAGE1), CCCTC-binding factor (CTCFL), DEAD-box helicase 53 (DDX53), the melanoma antigen gene (MAGE), 5'-nucleotidase, cytosolic IB (NT5C1B), P antigen family member 3-like (PAGE3-like), preferentially expressed antigen in melanoma (PRAME), and synovial sarcoma X chromosome breakpoint (SSX). MAGE proteins were detected by immunohistochemistry in 12.1 % (4/33) of CMM cases, including digital and oral melanoma, with healthy tissue expression restricted to the testis. CTA mRNA was detected by Real-time PCR in canine testis and validated through gel electrophoresis and Sanger sequencing. MAGE, PAGE3-like, and PRAME mRNA were strongly expressed in canine oral melanoma and metastatic cell lines with restricted expression in normal tissues. CAGE1, CTCFL, DDX53, and SSX6 were only weakly expressed or absent in canine oral melanoma. CTCFL and DDX53 expression in healthy tissues was not restricted to the testis, as moderate expression was found in the kidney. These results suggest that dogs express CTAs, similar to humans, and thus CTAs may serve as a target for immunotherapy in dogs.",,,e.j.a.m.sijts@uu.nl.
40359590,Vaccination and surveillance for high pathogenicity avian influenza in poultry-current situation and perspectives.,,Biologicals : journal of the International Association of Biological Standardization,10.1016/j.biologicals.2025.101840,"The International Alliance for Biological Standardization (IABS), in collaboration with the World Organization for Animal Health (WOAH) convened a hybrid meeting on 22-23 October 2024 at the WOAH Headquarters (HQ) in Paris, France to discuss the global state of vaccination and surveillance for high pathogenicity avian influenza (HPAI) in poultry. The primary objective of the meeting was to advance vaccination acceptance to both control virus spread and reduce disease. Vaccination is increasingly recognized as a tool to complement biosecurity, movement controls and stamping-out of infected flocks. However, concerns persist regarding the risk of undetected, sustained transmission (silent infection) in vaccinated flocks as a result of inadequate surveillance. This has contributed to both vaccination hesitancy and trade barriers. The meeting aimed to assess the current state of the art regarding HPAI surveillance programs in vaccinated populations and their effectiveness. Representatives of multiple stakeholders were invited to share their experiences and perspectives on the use of vaccination and accompanying surveillance to control the growing H5N1 panzootic and its global impact. Several conclusions and recommendations emerged as essential to advancing the acceptance of vaccination strategies. These included (1) the utility of quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) as a sensitive, specific and economical tool to detect virus in vaccinated populations, (2) regular testing of dead birds within a flock as a highly effective method for early detection of outbreaks in vaccinated flocks and demonstrating freedom from infection and, (3) the importance of collecting information on circulating field strains in the selection of candidate vaccine antigens to ensure adequate efficacy. Testing sentinel birds was deemed less effective for surveillance and serological testing of vaccinated birds was considered more useful for assessing immunity levels than for determining the infection status of a flock. There was broad agreement on the need to standardize surveillance outcomes in terms of accepted confidence levels to promote safe and fair trade. However, it was acknowledged that context and pragmatic considerations will shape the development of situation specific plans, which must be statistically valid, scientifically sound, economically feasible and operationally sustainable for both governments and industry. Concomitantly, it was recommended that trade policies tied to vaccination and surveillance should be based solely on science and risks. To this end, enforcement of existing international rules and resolution of disputes are considered a shared responsibility. Peer reviewed publications were proposed as a central mechanism for developing the stronger guidelines needed to facilitate fair trade agreements and enable implementation of global vaccination programs. Rapid dissemination of information, consistent messaging and exchange of virus isolates were also seen as critical for coordinating an effective global response to controlling HPAI.",Sajjadi NC; Baldinelli F; Cameron A; Dhingra M; Espeisse O; Ho J; Chua TH; Hussein K; Lyons N; Monne I; Okamuro Y; Pacheco DT; Pavade G; Poncon N; Prajitno TY; Rojas JG; Swayne D,EpiMundi; Animal Health Division; Poultry Veterinarian; Wageningen Bioveterinary Research (WBVR); Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations; Veterinary Health Division; Japfa Comfeed Indonesia Tbk; European Food Safety Authority (EFSA); Agriculture; IABS Chair; World Organization of Animal Health; Ministry of Agriculture and Food Sovereignty; Rapporteur; Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale Delle Venezie (IZSVe); Birdflu Veterinarian LLC,j.a.stegeman@uu.nl.

Effective biosecurity assessments are essential to prevent diseases and therefore, this study aimed to develop a risk-based weighted scoring system to evaluate biosecurity levels in backyard poultry households in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), as well as to describe its use in Bangladesh. A questionnaire was drafted with input from backyard poultry experts, followed by weights were attributed to the answers to obtain a weighted and risk-based questionnaire where scores represent the level of biosecurity measures. A score of 0 indicates absence of biosecurity measures, while 100 implies optimal biosecurity. The questionnaire was pretested with 20 households in Savar, Dhaka. Subsequently, 384 households were randomly selected from six districts in Bangladesh, based on the poultry population and consistent backyard poultry rearing. The scoring system is freely available online at https://biocheckgent.com/en/. External biosecurity (50 questions) was assessed in the following subcategories: purchase of eggs or day-old chicks, purchase of laying hens, depopulation and transport of poultry and poultry products, feed and water supply, visitors and farm personnel, manure and carcass removal, infrastructure and biological vectors of the farm, location of the farm. Internal biosecurity (13 questions) was subdivided in disease management and cleaning and disinfection. The average biosecurity scores for the external and internal categories were 30.3 % and 32.4 %, respectively. The two highest mean external biosecurity scores were obtained for depopulation and transport of poultry and poultry products (mean= 56.0 %) and manure and carcass removal (mean = 37.5 %) while the lowest means score was obtained for the category visitors and farm workers (mean = 12.4 %). In the internal biosecurity category, cleaning and disinfection had the highest mean score (34.1 %). Besides backyard production, small-scale commercial broiler production was present in 7 % of the visited households and the biosecurity score in these households was on average higher compared to those without commercial farming. This study reveals sub-optimal levels of biosecurity among backyard poultry in Bangladesh, as evaluated through the Biocheck.UGent scoring tool which has shown to be valuable for addressing biosecurity challenges in backyard production in low- and middle-income countries.

Therefore, this study aimed to determine the prevalence of T. solium cysticercosis, neurocysticercosis, seizures and chronic headaches in the Mocuba district, Zambézia province, Mozambique, and to assess their associations. The overall study combined both a community-based and a clinic-based segment, including epidemiological, clinical, laboratory and neuroradiological approaches, to investigate the prevalence and the association of cysticercosis, neurocysticercosis, seizure activity and chronic headaches in the Mocuba district. The community-based study involved 6,932 participants who were asked a questionnaire related to signs/symptoms of neurocysticercosis and who were asked to provide a blood sample for serological testing. Serological tests (Antigen-ELISA and Western blot) were used to detect cysticerci specific antigens and antibodies, respectively, in the participants. The clinic-based study included cerebral computed tomography (CT) of 233 individuals - a subset of those recruited from the community (with and without seizure activity and with and without cysticercosis based on serology). The prevalence of seizures and chronic headaches in the community-based study was 6.5% and 46.2% respectively, and the cysticercosis seroprevalence was 9.6%. Seizures and chronic headaches presented significant associations with cysticercosis seropositivity (p < 0.05). The clinic-based study revealed 9 (3.9%) of 233 individuals with neurocysticercosis-typical lesions on CT-scan of whom one case was negative on serology and on screening for seizure activity. The community-based prevalence of seizure activity and cysticercosis was high in the Mocuba district. There was also a significant association of seizure activity and chronic headaches with the seroprevalence of cysticercosis and 8 out of 9 people with neurocysticercosis had seizure activity. This highlights the importance of increased awareness and the need for building health literacy within the healthcare workforce and the communities as well as the implementation of targeted interventions, both for people with seizure activity with and without neurocysticercosis. Future research should also assess the impact of preventive measures in reducing disease burden caused by T. solium.",,,

Here, we report an increase in the proportion and activation state of TCRγδ+CD8α+ T cells in the PBMCs of 3 chicken lines (MHC homozygous H-B2 and H-B21 lines and outbred G-WL line) with the strongest responses observed in the more resistant H-B2 chickens. H9N2 AIV infection induced mRNA upregulation of interferon (IFN)-γ and cytotoxicity-associated molecules, including, Granzyme A, Granzyme K, and perforin in sorted TCRγδ+CD8α+ T cells. Moreover, in ex vivo cultured TCRγδ+CD8α+ T cells in response to H9N2 AIV infected splenocytes, strongly indicates the activation of these cells' cytolytic potential via detection of transcription levels of cytotoxic genes with quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), and IFN-γ protein level with ELISPOT and an intracellular cytokine staining assays. Most importantly, in vivo depletion of γδ T cells led to reduced H9N2 AIV control, which was particularly evident in the early phase of infection. Taken together, these results indicate that strong TCRγδ+CD8α+T cell response plays a critical role in protecting chicken against H9N2 AIV infection.",,,
40359336,Dynamics of postnatal bone development and epiphyseal synostosis in the caprine autopod.,,Developmental dynamics : an official publication of the American Association of Anatomists,10.1002/dvdy.70038,"Bones develop to structurally balance strength and mobility. Bone developmental dynamics are influenced by whether an animal is ambulatory at birth. Precocial species, which are ambulatory at birth, develop advanced skeletal maturity in utero and experience postnatal development under mechanical loading. Here, we characterized postnatal bone development in the lower forelimbs of precocial goats using microcomputed tomography and histology. Our analysis focused on the two phalanges 1 (P1) bones and the partially fused metacarpal bone of the goat autopod from birth through adulthood. P1 cortical bone densified rapidly after birth, but cortical thickness increased continually through adulthood. Upon normalization by body mass, the P1 normalized polar moment of inertia was constant over time, suggestive of changes correlating with ambulatory loading. P1 trabecular bone increased in trabecular number and thickness until sexual maturity (12 months), while metacarpal trabeculae grew primarily through trabecular thickening. Unlike prenatal synostosis (i.e., bone fusion) of the metacarpal diaphysis, synostosis of the epiphyses occurred postnatally, prior to growth plate closure, through a unique fibrocartilaginous endochondral ossification. These findings implicate ambulatory loading in postnatal bone development of precocial goats and identify a novel postnatal synostosis event in the caprine metacarpal epiphysis.",,,

We analyzed 26 temporal bones (17 cases) with head trauma with fractures (six cases, nine ears) and ones without fractures (11 cases, 17 ears). Appropriate age-matched control groups comprising temporal bones without temporal bone pathology were included for comparative purposes. Histopathological analyses included counts of Scarpa's ganglion cells (ScGCs) in the superior and inferior vestibular nerves (SVN and IVN), and counts of vestibular hair cells (HCs) in the utricle, saccule, lateral semicircular canal (LSCC), and posterior semicircular canal (PSCC). Mann-Whitney U tests were used for statistical analyses. The group without fractures showed a significant reduction in total ScGCs (SVN + IVN) compared to controls (p = 0.040), with a pronounced decrease in the SVN (p = 0.014). Significant reductions in type I and type II HCs were observed in the utricle (p = 0.008 and p = 0.035) and in type I HCs in the LSCC (p = 0.037). In the group with fractures, only type I HCs in the utricle were significantly reduced (p = 0.038). Head trauma without fractures is associated with more severe vestibular cell degeneration and greater loss of ganglion cells in the SVN in our specimens. These findings suggest that head trauma without fractures may pose a higher risk for vestibular cell damage compared with trauma with fractures. NA.",,,

The anatomical study of the dromedary paranasal sinuses was carried out using fenestrations and transverse anatomical sections and allowed us to study the location and the exact extent of each of these sinuses, as well as the topography and communication between the different sinus compartments. In our CT study, 19 images were obtained, enabling identification of the sinuses, associated deep structures and their communications. Thus, in the dromedary, the frontal sinus was very extensive in the frontal bone, divided into left and right sinuses, each frontal sinus being subdivided into cavities by numerous septa of variable size and position. The ventral conchal sinus was absent, and the maxillary sinus was single and not compartmentalised. The reconstructed 3D model was compared with anatomical sections to validate the accuracy of the observations.
