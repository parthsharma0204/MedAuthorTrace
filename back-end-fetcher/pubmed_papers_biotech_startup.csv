40376139,The Innovation Imperative: Time to Rewrite Academia's Compact With Industry.,,Cureus,10.7759/cureus.84103,"Academic medicine is at a crossroads. Amid historic federal disinvestment in research and persistent cultural resistance to industry collaboration, the traditional academic compact, based on grants, publications, and tenure, is no longer sustainable. Drawing on firsthand experience as a medical school dean, faculty, and biotech executive, this editorial argues that academic institutions must urgently reform how they value and support entrepreneurial scholarship. With fewer than 1% of university patents leading to licensed products, the prevailing model of late-stage, passive tech transfer has failed to translate innovation into impact. Meanwhile, global models from the Israel Innovation Authority to Singapore's Biopolis demonstrate the power of early, structured academia-industry partnerships. This piece proposes a new framework for evaluating faculty achievement, one that elevates patents, startups, regulatory wins, clinical product launches, and translational teaching as core academic contributions. It calls for institutional reforms to faculty appointment and promotion criteria, dedicated innovation offices, and policy incentives to reward real-world impact. The innovation imperative is clear: if academic medicine is to remain relevant, it must become an engine not only of knowledge, but of change.",Lakhan SE,Medical Office,
40338514,Do PGCCs in Solid Tumors Appear Due to Treatment-related Stress or Clonal Expansion of CSCs that Survive Oncotherapy?,,Stem cell reviews and reports,10.1007/s12015-025-10891-y,"Dedifferentiation of epithelial cells during epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) results in circulating tumor cells (CTCs) that are mobilized singly or in clusters in association with blood cells and results in metastasis. However, lineage tracing studies have failed to delineate any role of EMT during metastasis. Research is also focused on polyploid giant cancer cells (PGCCs) in solid tumors which appear in response to oncotherapy-related stress for their role in metastasis. But how to explain PGCCs role in metastatic tumors in treatment-naïve patients? Studies done using mouse models and clinical samples suggest that cancer initiates due to dysfunctions of tissue-resident, pluripotent very small embryonic-like stem cells (VSELs). VSELs are the most primitive and pluripotent stem cells that exist at top of cellular hierarchy in multiple tissues. They are normally quiescent and undergo asymmetrical cell divisions to give rise to two cells of different sizes and fates including smaller cells to self-renew and bigger tissue-specific progenitors. Progenitors undergo symmetrical cell divisions and clonal expansion (rapid proliferation, endoduplication with incomplete cytokinesis) to form giant cells that further breakdown and differentiate into tissue-specific cell types. Oncotherapy destroys actively dividing cells, but CSCs survive. We hypothesize that excessive self-renewal and clonal expansion of cancer stem cells (CSCs, dysfunctional VSELs) result in multinucleated giant cells (PGCCs) that accumulate as further differentiation into tissue-specific cell types is blocked in cancerous conditions. PGCCS are being reported by multiple groups whereas CSCs remain elusive due to small size and low abundance and actually contribute to both cancer initiation and metastasis.",Bhartiya D; Sharma N; Tripathi A; Tripathi A,Epigeneres Biotech Pvt Ltd,deepa.bhartiya@epigeneres.com.
40297622,The mechanisms of HER2 targeted ADCs are dependent on Rab GTPases.,,Therapeutic advances in medical oncology,10.1177/17588359251332473,"In the era of personalized cancer therapy, antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) have become one of the fastest-emerging groups of anticancer drugs. ADCs consist of an antibody coupled to a cytotoxic payload by a chemical linker, designed to be cleaved off intracellularly. Understanding the intracellular trafficking and processing of ADCs is crucial for elucidating their mechanism of action. This study aimed to compare trastuzumab deruxtecan (T-DXd) to ado-trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1) with emphasis on Rab GTPase-regulated intracellular trafficking and its impact on ADC efficacy. The efficacy of T-DXd and T-DM1 was assessed in a panel of HER2-positive cell lines. Correlations between ADC efficacy and the expression of HER2 and Rab GTPases were evaluated. Functional studies, including knockdown (KD), overexpression, and microscopy, were performed to evaluate the impact of Rab GTPases on ADC cytotoxicity. In contrast to T-DM1, T-DXd efficacy was found not to correlate to HER2 expression in a panel of HER2-positive cell lines. However, a correlation to RAB5A expression was found for T-DXd efficacy, although not as strong as for T-DM1. Altering the expression of RAB5 in our model system confirmed RAB5 to have an impact on both T-DXd and T-DM1 cytotoxicity, but more on T-DM1. In addition, RAB4a was found to influence T-DXd sensitivity, but not T-DM1, indicating differences in intracellular processing between T-DXd and T-DM1. The study demonstrates that ADC design significantly influences intracellular trafficking and processing. The linker design, in particular, plays a major role in determining the intracellular fate of an ADC.",,,

40235838,Surgical Management of Microstomia: A Comprehensive Review of Treatment Options.,,JPRAS open,10.1016/j.jpra.2025.03.002,"Microstomia is characterized by a reduced oral aperture, leading to impairments in speech, feeding, dental hygiene, and facial expressions. Nonsurgical treatments offer limited benefits for mild cases although surgical interventions have been shown to yield better outcomes. However, the unique anatomical challenges and limited availability of adjacent tissue present obstacles in surgical management of this condition. This review aims to provide a comprehensive summary of the reported surgical techniques for microstomia management and discuss their specific indications, advantages, and potential limitations. A comprehensive review was conducted in June 2024 to identify studies that have reported on the surgical techniques for microstomia management. A database search was performed on Medline, Embase, Scopus, and Web of Science. The study findings have been reported as per the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis guidelines. Quality assessment was conducted using the Case Report (CARE) guidelines and Methodological Index for Non-randomized Studies (MINORS) assessment. The search yielded a total of 1315 studies; of these, 28 met the inclusion criteria following a full-text screening. Ten surgical techniques for microstomia management were identified and categorized into the following three reconstructive modalities: grafts, local tissue transfer, and autologous free tissue transfer. The average scores of the CARE and MINORS assessments were 27.20/30 and 11.33/14 respectively. Selection of the appropriate surgical technique is critical for achieving successful results in microstomia reconstruction. The primary objective is to enlarge the oral opening while preserving oral function and achieving satisfactory cosmetic outcomes. The key considerations for choosing a surgical technique include contracture severity, perioral tissue availability, and the surgeon's familiarity with different surgical options.",,,
40220121,Attenuation of Cellular Senescence and Improvement of Osteogenic Differentiation Capacity of Human Liver Stem Cells Using Specific Senomorphic and Senolytic Agents.,,Stem cell reviews and reports,10.1007/s12015-025-10876-x,"Expansion of adult stem cells in culture increases the percent of senescent cells, reduces their differentiation capacity and limits their clinical use. Here, we investigated whether treatment with certain senotherapeutic drugs would reduce the accumulation of senescent cells during expansion of human liver stem cells (HLSCs) while maintaining their differentiation capacity. Our results demonstrate that chronic treatment with the senomorphic XJB-5-131 or the senolytics cocktail D + Q reduced the number of senescent cells and significantly reduced the expression of senescence-associated genes and several inflammatory SASP factors in later passage HLSCs. Additionally, treatment with XJB-5-131 and D + Q improved the capacity of HLSCs to undergo osteogenic differentiation following extensive in vitro expansion. Overall, our data demonstrate that treatment with XJB-5-13 or D + Q results in a reduction in the percentage of replication-induced senescent HLSCs and likely other types of adult stem cells and improve the potential therapeutic use of later passage human stem cells.",Grassi DJ; Tetta C,Aelis Farma; Unicyte AG,probbins@umn.edu.
40204579,Utilising the Benefit Risk Assessment of Vaccines (BRAVE) toolkit to evaluate the benefits and risks of Vaxzevria in the EU: a population-based study.,,The Lancet. Digital health,10.1016/j.landig.2025.02.001,"Several COVID-19 vaccines have been licensed. To support the assessment of safety signals, we developed a toolkit to support COVID-19 vaccine monitoring and benefit-risk assessment. We aim to show the application of our toolkit in the EU using thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS) associated with the Vaxzevria (AstraZeneca) vaccine as a use case. In this population-based study, we used a model incorporating data from multiple EU sources such as The European Surveillance System and EudraVigilance, and estimated the benefits of COVID-19 vaccines by comparing the observed COVID-19 confirmed cases, hospitalisations, intensive care unit (ICU) admissions, and deaths across Europe to the expected numbers in the absence of Vaxzevria vaccination. Risks of TTS associated with Vaxzevria were calculated by comparing the observed number of TTS events in individuals who received Vaxzevria to the expected number of events based on background incidence rates. To visualise the results, we developed a toolkit with an interactive web application. 62 598 505 Vaxzevria vaccines (32 763 183 to females and 29 835 322 to males) had been administered in Europe by Feb 10, 2021. Our results showed that a first dose of Vaxzevria provided benefits across all age groups. Based on vaccine effectiveness estimates and reported coverage in Europe, from Dec 13, 2020 to Dec 31, 2021, vaccination with Vaxzevria was estimated to prevent (per 100 000 doses) 12 113 COVID-19 cases, 1140 hospitalisations, 184 ICU admissions, and 261 deaths. Women aged 30-59 years and males aged 20-29 years had the highest frequency of TTS events. The benefits of vaccination outweighed the risks of TTS in all age groups, with the highest benefits and risks observed in individuals aged 60-69 years. Our toolkit and underlying model contextualised the risk of TTS associated with Vaxzevria relative to its benefits. The methodology employed could be applied to other serious adverse events related to COVID-19 or other vaccines. The adaptability and versatility of such toolkits might contribute to strengthening preparedness for future public health emergencies.

Here, we develop and characterize colloidal-fibrillar scaffolds through examination of the effects of relative colloid and fiber ratios within a fibrin-based model system composed of fibrin-based nanoparticles (FBNs) within a natural fibrin scaffold. At lower concentrations, FBNs primarily integrate into the fibrillar fibrin matrix, strengthening it. At high concentrations, colloid-colloid interactions dominate and FBNs primarily form a highly aligned secondary structure that does not strengthen the fibrillar matrix. At intermediate concentrations, both reinforcement of the fibrin matrix and colloid-colloid interactions are observed. Our characterization of this colloidal-fibrillar system provides insight into new avenues for wound healing biomaterial development. Using structural and mechanical results, we developed a biomimetic surgical sealant. When applied to a vascular healing model, FBN gel resulted in improved vessel healing. This colloidal-fibrillar composite can greatly improve healing outcomes and should be applied to other tissues.",,,aecarso2@ncsu.edu.

40054999,Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer (SITC) consensus statement on essential biomarkers for immunotherapy clinical protocols.,2025-05-11,Journal for immunotherapy of cancer,10.1136/jitc-2024-010928,"Immunotherapy of cancer is now an essential pillar of treatment for patients with many individual tumor types. Novel immune targets and technical advances are driving a rapid exploration of new treatment strategies incorporating immune agents in cancer clinical practice. Immunotherapies perturb a complex system of interactions among genomically unstable tumor cells, diverse cells within the tumor microenvironment including the systemic adaptive and innate immune cells. The drive to develop increasingly effective immunotherapy regimens is tempered by the risk of immune-related adverse events. Evidence-based biomarkers that measure the potential for therapeutic response and/or toxicity are critical to guide optimal patient care and contextualize the results of immunotherapy clinical trials. Responding to the lack of guidance on biomarker testing in early-phase immunotherapy clinical trials, we propose a definition and listing of essential biomarkers recommended for inclusion in all such protocols. These recommendations are based on consensus provided by the Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer (SITC) Clinical Immuno-Oncology Network (SCION) faculty with input from the SITC Pathology and Biomarker Committees and the Journal for ImmunoTherapy of Cancer readership. A consensus-based selection of essential biomarkers was conducted using a Delphi survey of SCION faculty. Regular updates to these recommendations are planned. The inaugural list of essential biomarkers includes complete blood count with differential to generate a neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio or systemic immune-inflammation index, serum lactate dehydrogenase and albumin, programmed death-ligand 1 immunohistochemistry, microsatellite stability assessment, and tumor mutational burden. Inclusion of these biomarkers across early-phase immunotherapy clinical trials will capture variation among trials, provide deeper insight into the novel and established therapies, and support improved patient selection and stratification for later-phase clinical trials.",Collyar D; Vos W; Diaz-Padilla I; Garrett-Mayer E; Grandi P; Simons VH; Takimoto CH,Patient Advocates In Research (PAIR); Radiomics.bio; Adze Biotech Inc; American Society of Clinical Oncology; Prostate Net; IGM Biosciences; GSK Oncology Research Unit,trc3@queensu.ca.
40052491,Advancing Allogeneic NK Cell Immunotherapy through Microfluidic Gene Delivery.,2025-05-10,"Advanced science (Weinheim, Baden-Wurttemberg, Germany)",10.1002/advs.202412544,"Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cell therapy has revolutionized cancer treatment, yet challenges such as manufacturing complexity, high costs, and safety concerns have spurred the development of alternatives like CAR-natural killer (NK) cell immunotherapies. CAR-NK cell therapies provide innate cytotoxicity with antigen-independent targeting, reducing safety risks while improving therapeutic efficacy. However, efficient genomic engineering and large-scale production of allogeneic NK cells remain significant obstacles. To address these challenges, a novel microfluidic gene delivery platform is developed, the Y-hydroporator, designed for allogeneic NK cell immunotherapy. This platform features a Y-shaped microchannel where NK cells experience rapid hydrodynamic stretching near the stagnation point, creating transient membrane discontinuities that facilitate the uptake of exogenous cargo.

Two cohorts of infants with febrile urinary tract infection were included. Renal involvement was defined by DMSA scans and molecular disease determinants by gene expression analysis and proteomic screens, at diagnosis and after 6 mo. Innate immune hyper-activation, systemically and locally in the urinary tract, was defined as a cytokine storm. Neutrophil degranulation and renal toxicity genes were strongly regulated, with overexpression in the APN group (first DMSA+). Adaptive immune attenuation in the APN group further supported the notion of an immune imbalance. DNA exome genotyping identified APN and febrile urinary tract infection as genetically distinct and scarring associated genes, but the activation of renal toxicity genes during acute infection was unrelated to the development of renal scarring. The results define APN as a hyper-inflammatory disorder with the characteristics of a cytokine storm combined with adaptive immune attenuation. The findings are consistent with innate immune dysfunctions and neutrophil disorders identified as determinants of APN susceptibility in genetic models.",Lee B,Singapore Immunology Network,catharina.svanborg@med.lu.se.

This study evaluated glutamine metabolism targeting with EGFR inhibition to identify response biomarkers in patients with prior anti-EGFR treatment progression. We conducted a phase I/II trial in patients with KRAS wild-type mCRC, combining panitumumab (6 mg/kg) and CB-839 (600 mg/kg or 800 mg/kg), hypothesizing that the dual inhibition of glutamine metabolism and MAPK signaling would enhance outcomes. As study correlatives, we investigated the B-cell activation signature ""B-score"" and glutamine PET as potential treatment response biomarkers. The combination of panitumumab and CB-839 was tolerable with manageable side effects, including grade 4 hypomagnesemia in four patients, a known panitumumab-related event. Two patients achieved partial response, and five had stable disease, with a 41% disease control rate. Median progression-free survival and overall survival were 1.84 and 8.87 months, respectively. A positive correlation between ""B-score"" and lesion size reduction suggested its association with clinical benefit (partial response and stable disease). Lower ""B-score"" correlated with greater tumor avidity for glutamine by PET, indicating B-cell activation sensitivity to glutamine depletion. The combination of CB-839 and panitumumab showed safety and promising preliminary responses, but the study closed early due to CB-839 development termination. The B-cell activation signature ""B-score"" emerged as a potential biomarker for EGFR and glutaminase inhibition in mCRC, warranting further studies.

Diabetes & endocrinology,10.1016/S2213-8587(24)00316-4,"Current BMI-based measures of obesity can both underestimate and overestimate adiposity and provide inadequate information about health at the individual level, which undermines medically-sound approaches to health care and policy. This Commission sought to define clinical obesity as a condition of illness that, akin to the notion of chronic disease in other medical specialties, directly results from the effect of excess adiposity on the function of organs and tissues. The specific aim of the Commission was to establish objective criteria for disease diagnosis, aiding clinical decision making and prioritisation of therapeutic interventions and public health strategies. To this end, a group of 58 experts—representing multiple medical specialties and countries—discussed available evidence and participated in a consensus development process. Among these commissioners were people with lived experience of obesity to ensure consideration of patients’ perspectives. The Commission defines obesity as a condition characterised by excess adiposity, with or without abnormal distribution or function of adipose tissue, and with causes that are multifactorial and still incompletely understood. We define clinical obesity as a chronic, systemic illness characterised by alterations in the function of tissues, organs, the entire individual, or a combination thereof, due to excess adiposity. Clinical obesity can lead to severe end-organ damage, causing life-altering and potentially life-threatening complications (eg, heart attack, stroke, and renal failure). We define preclinical obesity as a state of excess adiposity with preserved function of other tissues and organs and a varying, but generally increased, risk of developing clinical obesity and several other non-communicable diseases (eg, type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, certain types of cancer, and mental disorders). Although the risk of mortality and obesity-associated diseases can rise as a continuum across increasing levels of fat mass, we differentiate between preclinical and clinical obesity (ie, health ",Branca F; Galea G; Luna Fuentes JR; Mooney VM; Nadglowski J,Obesity Action Coalition; Department of Nutrition and Food Safety; Mexican Society of Obesity; Regional Office for Europe; European Coalition for people Living with Obesity,francesco.rubino@kcl.ac.uk.

Exercise enhances metabolic flexibility, making it an important tool for discovering mechanisms that promote metabolic health. Here we show that pantothenate kinase 4 (PanK4) is a new conserved exercise target with high abundance in muscle. Muscle-specific deletion of PanK4 impairs fatty acid oxidation which is related to higher intramuscular acetyl-CoA and malonyl-CoA levels. Elevated acetyl-CoA levels persist regardless of feeding state and are associated with whole-body glucose intolerance, reduced insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in glycolytic muscle, and impaired glucose uptake during exercise. Conversely, increasing PanK4 levels in glycolytic muscle lowers acetyl-CoA and enhances glucose uptake. Our findings highlight PanK4 as an important regulator of acetyl-CoA levels, playing a key role in both muscle lipid and glucose metabolism.",,,maximilian.kleinert@dife.de.

Two members of the family require binding of low-molecular weight ligands for their activity: the vertebrate aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) and the insect juvenile hormone receptor (JHR). In the fly Drosophila melanogaster, the paralogous proteins GCE and MET constitute the ligand-binding component of JHR complexes. Whilst GCE/MET and AHR are phylogenetically heterologous, their mode of action is similar. JHR is targeted by several synthetic agonists that serve as insecticides disrupting the insect endocrine system. AHR is an important regulator of human endocrine homeostasis, and it responds to environmental pollutants and endocrine disruptors. Whether AHR signaling is affected by compounds that can activate JHR has not been reported. To address this question, we screened a chemical library of 50,000 compounds to identify 93 novel JHR agonists in a reporter system based on Drosophila cells. Of these compounds, 26% modulated AHR signaling in an analogous reporter assay in a human cell line, indicating a significant overlap in the agonist repertoires of the two receptors. To explore the structural features of agonist-dependent activation of JHR and AHR, we compared the ligand-binding cavities and their interactions with selective and common ligands of AHR and GCE. Molecular dynamics modeling revealed ligand-specific as well as conserved side chains within the respective cavities. Significance of predicted interactions was supported through site-directed mutagenesis. The results have indicated that synthetic insect juvenile hormone agonists might interfere with AHR signaling in human cells.",,,sedlak@img.cas.cz.

Common variants of monogenic diabetes genes (MDG) may jointly influence the risk of young-onset type 2 diabetes (YOD, diagnosed before the age of 40 years) and cardiovascular and kidney events. Using whole-exome sequencing data, we constructed a weighted polygenic risk score (wPRS) consisting of 135 common variants (minor allele frequency >0.01) of 34 MDG based on r In the discovery cohort, the OR of the 135 common variants for YOD ranged from 1.00 to 2.61.

This was motivated by our previous work showing that R(+) propranolol can block blood vessel formation in a preclinical model of IH.

Both PD-1- and PD-L1-targeted ICKs demonstrated similar in vitro performance, significantly increasing IL-12 tethering to immune cells and enhancing T cell cytotoxic activity compared with IL-12 alone. The antitumor efficacy of ICKs was evaluated by intratumoral delivery using self-amplifying RNA-based vectors or as recombinant proteins in mice. Despite effective PD-L1-mediated tumor anchoring and promising in vitro results, IL-12 antitumor activity was significantly enhanced only when specific targeting to intratumoral T cells was achieved via anti-PD-1 Nb. This effect was also observed when the PD-1 specific ICK was delivered by electroporation of a DNA/RNA layered vector.

Therefore, we aimed to investigate whether specific pathophysiological pathways drive the clinical heterogeneity in type 2 diabetes. We employed newly developed type 2 diabetes hard-clustering and soft-clustering pathway-specific polygenic risk scores (psPRSs) to characterise individual genetic susceptibility to pathophysiological pathways implicated in type 2 diabetes in 18,217 Chinese patients from Hong Kong. The 'total' type 2 diabetes polygenic risk score (PRS) was summed by genome-wide significant type 2 diabetes signals (n=1289). We examined the associations between psPRSs and cardiometabolic profile, age of onset, two glycaemic deterioration outcomes (clinical requirement of insulin treatment, defined by two consecutive HbA Although most psPRSs and total type 2 diabetes PRS were associated with an earlier and younger onset of type 2 diabetes, the psPRSs showed distinct associations with clinical outcomes.

The psPRSs for obesity were associated with faster progression to clinical requirement of insulin treatment (adjusted HR [95% CI] 1.09 [1.05, 1.13], p<0.0001), end-stage renal disease (1.10 [1.04, 1.16], p=0.0007) and CVD (1.10 [1.05, 1.16], p<0.0001) while the psPRSs for beta cell dysfunction were associated with reduced incident end-stage renal disease (0.90 [0.85, 0.95], p=0.0001) and heart failure (0.83 [0.73, 0.93], p=0.0011). Major findings remained significant after adjusting for a set of clinical variables. Beta cell dysfunction and lipodystrophy could be the driving pathological pathways in type 2 diabetes in individuals with normal weight.

Hence, there is an urgent need to identify effective therapeutic targets for this condition. While epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is prominently expressed in TNBC and recognized as a therapeutic target, anti-EGFR therapies have yet to gain approval for breast cancer treatment due to their associated side effects and limited efficacy. Here, we discovered that intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) exhibits elevated expression levels in metastatic breast cancer and serves as a pivotal binding adaptor for EGFR activation, playing a crucial role in malignant progression. The activation of EGFR by tumor-expressed ICAM-1 initiates biased signaling within the JAK1/STAT3 pathway, consequently driving epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and facilitating heightened metastasis without influencing tumor growth. Remarkably, ICAM-1-neutralizing antibody treatment significantly suppressed cancer metastasis in a breast cancer orthotopic xenograft mouse model. In conclusion, our identification of ICAM-1 as a novel tumor intrinsic regulator of EGFR activation offers valuable insights for the development of TNBC-specific anti-EGFR therapies.",Kim MJ; Jin YW; Lee SJ,Fibrosis and Cancer Targeting Biotechnology (FNCT BIOTECH),jmyi76@inje.ac.kr.

C57BL/6J mice were randomly assigned to control or 100 mg/kg 6'-SL. After 12 weeks of 6'-SL administration, the mice were made to perform treadmill exercise; their blood lactate and glucose levels were measured at the basal level (rest) and 0, 5, and 10 min after treadmill exercise. Results showed that 6'-SL treatment in C57BL/6J mice significantly reduced blood lactate level and improved blood glucose level. Moreover, 6'-SL increased the expression of slow-myosin heavy chain (MHC) and OXPHOS in gastrocnemius muscle. In addition, 6'-SL treatment for 12 weeks did not affect food intake, serum biomarkers of tissue injury, and lipid profiles compared with those of the controls. These findings indicate that non-toxic 6'-SL suppressed muscle fatigue during exercise by promoting protein expression of muscle fibers, especially slow-twitch muscle fibers characterized by abundant OXPHOS complexes and decreased blood lactate level.

By using a human-relevant large animal model, the domestic boar, this study focuses on furthering our understanding of the involvement of the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) in sperm capacitation. The UPS is a universal, evolutionarily conserved, cellular proteome-wide degradation and recycling machinery, that has been shown to play a significant role in reproduction during the past two decades. Herein, we have used a bottom-up proteomic approach to (i) monitor the capacitation-related changes in the sperm protein levels, and (ii) identify the targets of UPS regulation during sperm capacitation. Spermatozoa were capacitated under proteasomal activity-permissive and inhibiting conditions and extracted sperm proteins were subjected to high-resolution mass spectrometry. We report that 401 individual proteins differed at least two-fold in abundance (P < 0.05) after in vitro capacitation (IVC) and 13 proteins were found significantly different (P < 0.05) between capacitated spermatozoa with proteasomal inhibition compared to the vehicle control. These proteins were associated with biological processes including sperm capacitation, sperm motility, metabolism, binding to zona pellucida, and proteasome-mediated catabolism. Changes in RAB2A, CFAP161, and TTR during IVC were phenotyped by immunocytochemistry, image-based flow cytometry, and Western blotting. We conclude that (i) the sperm proteome is subjected to extensive remodeling during sperm capacitation, and (ii) the UPS has a narrow range of distinct protein substrates during capacitation. This knowledge highlights the importance of the UPS in sperm capacitation and offers opportunities to identify novel pharmacological targets to modulate sperm fertilizing ability for the benefit of human reproductive health, assisted reproductive therapy, and contraception, as well as reproductive management in food animal agriculture.",,,zigom@missouri.edu.

Despite significant recent progress in advancing new methods of neuromodulation, none has successfully replicated the efficacy of traditional wired stimulation and improved on its downsides without introducing new complications. Due to the capability to convert magnetic fields into local electric fields, MagnetoElectric NanoParticle (MENP) neuromodulation is a recently proposed framework based on new materials that can locally sensitize neurons to specific, low-strength alternating current (AC) magnetic fields (50Hz 1.7 kOe field). However, the current research into this neuromodulation concept is at a very early stage, and the theoretically feasible game-changing advantages remain to be proven experimentally. To break this stalemate phase, this study leveraged understanding of the non-linear properties of MENPs and the nanoparticles' field interaction with the cellular microenvironment. Particularly, the applied magnetic field's strength and frequency were tailored to the M - H hysteresis loop of the nanoparticles. Furthermore, rectangular prisms instead of the more traditional ""spherical"" nanoparticle shapes were used to: (i) maximize the magnetoelectric effect and (ii) improve the nanoparticle-cell-membrane surface interface. Neuromodulation performance was evaluated in a series of exploratory in vitro experiments on 2446 rat hippocampus neurons. Linear mixed effect models were used to ensure the independence of samples by accounting for fixed adjacency effects in synchronized firing. Neural activity was measured over repeated 4-min segments, containing 90 s of baseline measurements, 90 s of stimulation measurements, and 60 s of post stimulation measurements. 87.5 % of stimulation attempts produced statistically significant (P < 0.05) changes in neural activity, with 58.3 % producing large changes (P < 0.01). In negative controls using either zero or 1.7 kOe-strength field without nanoparticles, no experiments produced significant changes in neural activity (P > 0.05 and P > 0.15 respectively). Furthermore, an exploratory analysis of a direct current (DC) magnetic field indicated that the DC field could be used with MENPs to inhibit neuron activity (P < 0.01). These experiments demonstrated the potential for magnetoelectric neuromodulation to offer a near one-to-one functionality match with conventional electrode stimulation without requiring surgical intervention or genetic modification to achieve success, instead relying on physical properties of these nanoparticles as ""On/Off"" control mechanisms. ONE-SENTENCE SUMMARY: This in vitro neural cell culture study explores how to exploit the non-linear and anisotropic properties of magnetoelectric nanoparticles for wireless neuromodulation, the importance of magnetic field strength and frequency matching for optimization, and demonstrates, for the first time, that magnetoelectric neuromodulation can inhibit neural responses.",Liang P,Cellular Nanomed,skhizroev@miami.edu.

However, despite its established health benefits, the effect of SL on exercise performance and muscle mass in mice remains unknown. Here, we aimed to investigate, for the first time, the effects of 6'-SL on muscle functions. Seven-week-old male C57BL/6J mice were administered 100 mg/kg 6'-SL for 12 weeks, after which exhaustive treadmill performance was conducted. Moreover, muscle strength was examined by grip strength, and muscle phenotype characteristics such as muscle mass, muscle fiber size, and muscle protein expression were also examined. The administration of 6'-SL significantly improved exhaustive treadmill performance metrics, including distance and exhaustion time. Grip strength was also increased by 6'-SL administration. Additionally, 6'-SL increased muscle mass in both the gastrocnemius (GAS) and soleus. 6'-SL administration led to an increase in the minimum Feret's diameter and the protein expression of total myosin heavy chain in the GAS muscle. In conclusion, 6'-SL administration in vivo led to increased running distance and time by increasing muscle mass and strength. These findings collectively indicate that 6'-SL is a potential agent for improving muscle health and exercise performance.",Park EJ; Kim LL; Go HR,GeneChem Inc.,

The expansion of digital pathology in recent years and its potential interface with diagnostic artificial intelligence algorithms provides an opportunity to democratize access to personalized medicine. Current digital pathology workstations, however, cost thousands to hundreds of thousands of dollars. As cancer incidence rises in many low- and middle-income countries, the validation and implementation of low-cost automated diagnostic tools will be crucial to helping healthcare providers manage the growing burden of cancer. Here we describe a low-cost ($230) workstation for digital slide capture and computational analysis composed of open-source components. We analyze the predictive performance of deep learning models when they are used to evaluate pathology images captured using this open-source workstation versus images captured using common, significantly more expensive hardware. Validation studies assessed model performance on three distinct datasets and predictive models: head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HPV positive versus HPV negative), lung cancer (adenocarcinoma versus squamous cell carcinoma), and breast cancer (invasive ductal carcinoma versus invasive lobular carcinoma). When compared to traditional pathology image capture methods, low-cost digital slide capture and analysis with the open-source workstation, including the low-cost microscope device, was associated with model performance of comparable accuracy for breast, lung, and HNSCC classification. At the patient level of analysis, AUROC was 0.84 for HNSCC HPV status prediction, 1.0 for lung cancer subtype prediction, and 0.80 for breast cancer classification. Our ability to maintain model performance despite decreased image quality and low-power computational hardware demonstrates that it is feasible to massively reduce costs associated with deploying deep learning models for digital pathology applications. Improving access to cutting-edge diagnostic tools may provide an avenue for reducing disparities in cancer care between high- and low-income regions.

We aimed to understand the size and type of digital health investments occurring in the prepandemic and pandemic periods. We examined health care companies founded from March 14, 2019, to March 14, 2020 (prepandemic) versus those founded from March 15, 2020, to March 14, 2022, after pandemic onset. Data were obtained from Crunchbase, a publicly available database that catalogs information about venture capital investments for companies. We also compared companies founded prepandemic to those founded after the first year of the pandemic (pandemic steady-state). We performed a Wilcoxon rank sum test to compare median funding amounts. We compared the 2 groups of companies according to the type of funding round raised, geography, health care subcategory, total amount of funding per year since founding, and number of founders. There were 2714 and 2218 companies founded prepandemic and during the pandemic, respectively. The companies were similarly distributed across geographies in the prepandemic and pandemic periods (P=.46) with no significant differences in the number of founders (P=.32). There was a significant difference in total funding per year since founding between prepandemic and pandemic companies (US $10.8 million vs US $20.9 million; P<.001). The distribution of funding rounds differed significantly for companies founded in prepandemic and pandemic periods (P<.001). On excluding data from the first year of the pandemic, there were 581 companies founded in the pandemic steady-state period from March 14, 2021, to March 14, 2022. Companies founded prepandemic had a significantly greater mean number of founders than those founded during the pandemic (P=.02). There was no significant difference in total funding per year since founding between prepandemic and steady-state pandemic companies (US $10.8 million vs US $14.4 million; P=.34).

Nucleic acids,10.1016/j.omtn.2024.102282,"Although our understanding of herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) biology has been considerably enhanced, developing therapeutic strategies to eliminate HSV-1 in latently infected individuals remains a public health concern. Current antiviral drugs used for the treatment of HSV-1 complications are not specific and do not address latent infection. We recently developed a CRISPR-Cas9-based gene editing platform to specifically target the HSV-1 genome. In this study, we further used 2D Vero cell culture and 3D human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cerebral organoid (CO) models to assess the effectiveness of our editing constructs targeting viral ICP0 or ICP27 genes. We found that targeting the ICP0 or ICP27 genes with AAV2-CRISPR-Cas9 vectors in Vero cells drastically suppressed HSV-1 replication. In addition, we productively infected COs with HSV-1, characterized the viral replication kinetics, and established a viral latency model. Finally, we discovered that ICP0- or ICP27-targeting AAV2-CRISPR-Cas9 vector significantly reduced viral rebound in the COs that were latently infected with HSV-1. In summary, our results suggest that CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing of HSV-1 is an efficient therapeutic approach to eliminate the latent viral reservoir and treat HSV-1-associated complications.",Ruan GX; Gordon J,Excision BioTherapeutics Inc.,

To be a broadly useful platform, there needs to be a strategy for attaching macromolecules to the inside or the outside of the VLP with minimal modification of the platform or cargo. Here, we repurpose antiviral compounds that bind to hepatitis B virus (HBV) capsids to create a chemical tag to noncovalently attach cargo to the VLP. Our tag consists of a capsid assembly modulator, HAP13, connected to a linker terminating in maleimide. Our cargo is a green fluorescent protein (GFP) with a single addressable cysteine, a feature that can be engineered in many proteins. The HAP-GFP construct maintained HAP's intrinsic ability to bind HBV capsids and accelerate assembly. We investigated the capacity of HAP-GFP to coassemble with HBV capsid protein and bind to preassembled capsids. HAP-GFP binding was concentration-dependent, sensitive to capsid stability, and dependent on linker length. Long linkers had the greatest activity to bind capsids, while short linkers impeded assembly and damaged intact capsids. In coassembly reactions, >20 HAP-GFP molecules were presented on the outside and inside of the capsid, concentrating the cargo by more than 100-fold compared to bulk solution. We also tested an HAP-GFP with a cleavable linker so that external GFP molecules could be removed, resulting in exclusive internal packaging. These results demonstrate a generalizable strategy for attaching cargo to a VLP, supporting development of HBV as a modular VLP platform.",,,

In general, discovery scientists working in pharma and biotech are advantaged over their academic counterparts and the relative advantages and disadvantages associated are discussed in depth. Against all odds, an increasing number of important drugs have had their origins in academia. This article reports three case studies from the Liotta Research Group (LRG), which explores the special circumstances that allowed these drug development campaigns to be successful. The first involves the antiretroviral agent, emtricitabine. In this case efficient synthetic methodology, developed in the LRG, coupled with some key university and commercial sector partnerships, enabled a group of academic collaborators to discover and develop a highly effective HIV reverse transcriptase inhibitor. The second case study involves the discovery and development of the breakthrough hepatitis C drug, sofosbuvir. Based on key input from Professors Schinazi and Liotta at Emory University, scientists at the Emory startup, Pharmasset, identified the nucleoside core of the drug that would become sofosbuvir. Subsequent analysis of its phosphorylation profile by Pharmasset scientists suggested that converting it to its corresponding monophosphate prodrug would circumvent a kinase block and enable it to be an effective hepatitis C polymerase inhibitor. The third case study describes the formation of DRIVE (Drug Innovation Ventures at Emory)/EIDD (Emory Institute for Drug Development), which were created to circumvent unintended impediments for carrying out academic drug discovery and development. Although DRIVE/EIDD is a wholly-owned, not-for-profit subsidiary of Emory University, it contains many attributes that enables it to operate much more nimbly than a typical academic laboratory. With an experienced drug development team and no shareholders to distract them, DRIVE/EIDD was able to focus its attention of the development of drugs to address viral diseases of global concern. In particular, their strategy to identify and develop an antiviral agent active against multiple single-stranded RNA viruses led to molnupiravir, a broadly active, oral drug that received Emergency Use Authorization for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infections (i.e., COVID-19).",,,dliotta@emory.edu.

In this study, we characterized two murine embryonic clonal preadipocyte lines, EB5 and EB7, each displaying unique gene marker expression profiles. EB5 cells differentiate into brown adipocytes, whereas EB7 cells into brite (also known as beige) adipocytes. To draw a comprehensive comparison, we contrasted the gene expression patterns, adipogenic capacity, as well as carbohydrate and lipid metabolism of these cells to that of F442A, a well-known white preadipocyte and adipocyte model. We found that commitment to differentiation in both EB5 and EB7 cells can be induced by 3-Isobutyl-1-methylxanthine/dexamethasone (Mix/Dex) and staurosporine/dexamethasone (St/Dex) treatments. Additionally, the administration of rosiglitazone significantly enhances the brown and brite adipocyte phenotypes. Our data also reveal the involvement of a series of genes in the transcriptional cascade guiding adipogenesis, pinpointing GSK3β as a critical regulator for both EB5 and EB7 adipogenesis. In a developmental context, we observe that, akin to brown fat progenitors, brite fat progenitors make their appearance in murine development by 11-12 days of gestation or potentially earlier. This result contributes to our understanding of adipocyte lineage specification during embryonic development. In conclusion, EB5 and EB7 cell lines are valuable for research into adipocyte biology, providing insights into the differentiation and development of brown and beige adipocytes.

Initially, uPA/uPAR was considered thrombolytic (clot-dissolving); however, recent studies have demonstrated its predominant immunomodulatory functions in inflammation and cancer. The uPA/uPAR complex has a multifaceted central role in both normal physiological and also pathological responses. uPAR is expressed as a glycophosphatidylinositol (GPI)-linked receptor interacting with vitronectin, integrins, G protein-coupled receptors, and growth factor receptors within a large lipid raft. Through protein-to-protein interactions, cell surface uPAR modulates intracellular signaling, altering cellular adhesion and migration. The uPA/uPAR also modifies extracellular activity, activating plasminogen to form plasmin, which breaks down fibrin, dissolving clots and activating matrix metalloproteinases that lyse connective tissue, allowing immune and cancer cell invasion and releasing growth factors. uPAR is now recognized as a biomarker for inflammatory diseases and cancer; uPAR and soluble uPAR fragments (suPAR) are increased in viral sepsis (COVID-19), inflammatory bowel disease, and metastasis. Here, we provide a comprehensive overview of the structure, function, and current studies examining uPAR and suPAR as diagnostic markers and therapeutic targets.

Unfortunately, immunosenescence, a progressively dysregulated immunity with age, hampers effective SNC elimination, leading to accumulation, coupled with the release of SASPs, which, in turn, inhibits immunity and heightened susceptibility to aging-associated diseases (AADs). Natural killer (NK) cells, integral to the innate immune system, play a pivotal role in addressing SNCs swiftly. These cells also coordinate with other components of both innate and adaptive immunity to surveil and eliminate these cells. Accordingly, preserving NK cell function during aging is crucial for evading AADs and promoting healthy aging. Alternatively, NK-cell-based therapies present promising avenues for addressing the challenges associated with aging. Notable, recent studies in adoptive NK cell therapy have shown promise in rejuvenating immunosenescence, eliminating SNCs, and alleviating SASPs.

However, the influence of maternal factors on the neonatal microbiota remains obscure. Herein, our observations suggest that the neonatal microbiotas, particularly the buccal microbiota, change rapidly within 24-48 h of birth but begin to stabilize by 48-72 h after parturition. Network analysis clustered over 200 maternal factors into thirteen distinct groups, and most associated factors were in the same group. Multiple maternal factor groups were associated with the neonatal buccal, rectal, and stool microbiotas. Particularly, a higher maternal inflammatory state and a lower maternal socioeconomic position were associated with a higher alpha diversity of the neonatal buccal microbiota and beta diversity of the neonatal stool microbiota was influenced by maternal diet and cesarean section by 24-72 h postpartum. The risk of admission of a neonate to the newborn intensive care unit was associated with preterm birth as well as higher cytokine levels and probably higher alpha diversity of the maternal buccal microbiota.",,,gregory.buck@vcuhealth.org.

However, multicenter longitudinal assessments of such measures are few. We recently demonstrated that baseline assessments of gait, tremor, finger tapping, and speech from a commercially available smartwatch, smartphone, and research-grade wearable sensors differed significantly between 82 individuals with early, untreated PD and 50 age-matched controls. Here, we evaluated the longitudinal change in these assessments over 12 months in a multicenter observational study using a generalized additive model, which permitted flexible modeling of at-home data. All measurements were included until participants started medications for PD. Over one year, individuals with early PD experienced significant declines in several measures of gait, an increase in the proportion of day with tremor, modest changes in speech, and few changes in psychomotor function. As measured by the smartwatch, the average (SD) arm swing in-clinic decreased from 25.9 (15.3) degrees at baseline to 19.9 degrees (13.7) at month 12 (P = 0.004). The proportion of awake time an individual with early PD had tremor increased from 19.3% (18.0%) to 25.6% (21.4%; P < 0.001). Activity, as measured by the number of steps taken per day, decreased from 3052 (1306) steps per day to 2331 (2010; P = 0.16), but this analysis was restricted to 10 participants due to the exclusion of those that had started PD medications and lost the data. The change of these digital measures over 12 months was generally larger than the corresponding change in individual items on the Movement Disorder Society-Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale but not greater than the change in the overall scale. Successful implementation of digital measures in future clinical trials will require improvements in study conduct, especially data capture.

In CKD, the cellular protein turnover is imbalanced, with protein degradation outweighing protein synthesis, leading to a loss of protein and cell mass, which impairs tissue function. As CKD itself, skeletal muscle wasting, or sarcopenia, can have various origins and causes, and both CKD and sarcopenia share common risk factors, such as diabetes, obesity, and age. While these pathologies together with reduced physical performance and malnutrition contribute to muscle loss, they cannot explain all features of CKD-associated sarcopenia. Metabolic acidosis, systemic inflammation, insulin resistance and the accumulation of uremic toxins have been identified as additional factors that occur in CKD and that can contribute to sarcopenia. Here, we discuss the elevation of systemic phosphate levels, also called hyperphosphatemia, and the imbalance in the endocrine regulators of phosphate metabolism as another CKD-associated pathology that can directly and indirectly harm skeletal muscle tissue. To identify causes, affected cell types, and the mechanisms of sarcopenia and thereby novel targets for therapeutic interventions, it is important to first characterize the precise pathologic changes on molecular, cellular, and histologic levels, and to do so in CKD patients as well as in animal models of CKD, which we describe here in detail. We also discuss the currently known pathomechanisms and therapeutic approaches of CKD-associated sarcopenia, as well as the effects of hyperphosphatemia and the novel drug targets it could provide to protect skeletal muscle in CKD.",,,

To identify novel therapeutic approaches, we performed CRISPR/Cas9 knockout screens and discovered TGFβ activated kinase (TAK1) as a selective survival factor in a significant fraction of GSCs. Loss of TAK1 kinase activity results in RIPK1-dependent apoptosis via Caspase-8/FADD complex activation, dependent on autocrine TNFα ligand production and constitutive TNFR signaling. We identify a transcriptional signature associated with immune activation and the mesenchymal GBM subtype to be a characteristic of cancer cells sensitive to TAK1 perturbation and employ this signature to accurately predict sensitivity to the TAK1 kinase inhibitor HS-276. In addition, exposure to pro-inflammatory cytokines IFNγ and TNFα can sensitize resistant GSCs to TAK1 inhibition. Our findings reveal dependency on TAK1 kinase activity as a novel vulnerability in immune-activated cancers, including mesenchymal GBMs that can be exploited therapeutically.",,,kristian.helin@icr.ac.uk.

In East Asians, classical type 1 diabetes is uncommon in patients with youngonset diabetes diagnosed before age of 40, in whom a family history, obesity, and beta-cell and kidney dysfunction are key features. Young-onset diabetes affects one in five Asian adults with diabetes in clinic settings; however, it is often misclassified, resulting in delayed or non-targeted treatment. Complex aetiologies, long disease duration, aggressive clinical course, and a lack of evidence-based guidelines have contributed to variable care standards and premature death in these young patients. The high burden of comorbidities, notably mental illness, highlights the numerous knowledge gaps related to this silent killer. The majority of adult patients with youngonset diabetes are managed as part of a heterogeneous population of patients with various ages of diagnosis. A multidisciplinary care team led by physicians with special interest in young-onset diabetes will help improve the precision of diagnosis and address their physical, mental, and behavioral health. To this end, payors, planners, and providers need to align and re-design the practice environment to gather data systematically during routine practice to elucidate the multicausality of young-onset diabetes, treat to multiple targets, and improve outcomes in these vulnerable individuals.",,,

Atrial tissue samples from three CREM-Tg mice and three wild-type littermates were subjected to unbiased mass spectrometry-based quantitative proteomics, differential expression and pathway enrichment analysis, and protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analysis. A total of 98 differentially expressed proteins were identified. Gene ontology analysis revealed enrichment for biological processes regulating actin cytoskeleton organization and extracellular matrix (ECM) dynamics. Changes in ITGAV, FBLN5, and LCP1 were identified as being relevant to atrial fibrosis and structural based on expression changes, co-expression patterns, and PPI network analysis. Comparative analysis with previously published datasets revealed a shift in protein expression patterns from ion-channel and metabolic regulators in young CREM-Tg mice to profibrotic remodeling factors in older CREM-Tg mice. Furthermore, older CREM-Tg mice exhibited protein expression patterns reminiscent of those seen in humans with persistent AF.

Our study explored the potential of enhancing ccRCC treatment by concurrently using CXCR2 inhibitors alongside immunotherapies. We analyzed ELR + CXCL levels and their correlation with patient survival during immunotherapy. RCT001, a unique CXCR2 inhibitor, was examined for its mechanism of action, particularly its effects on human primary macrophages. We tested the synergistic impact of RCT001 in combination with immunotherapies in both mouse models of ccRCC and human ccRCC in the presence of human PBMC. Elevated ELR + CXCL cytokine levels were found to correlate with reduced overall survival during immunotherapy. RCT001, our optimized compound, acted as an inverse agonist, effectively inhibiting angiogenesis and reducing viability of primary ccRCC cells. It redirected M2-like macrophages without affecting M1-like macrophage polarization directed against the tumor. In mouse models, RCT001 enhanced the efficacy of anti-CTLA4 + anti-PD1 by inhibiting tumor-associated M2 macrophages and tumor-associated neutrophils. It also impacted the activation of CD4 T lymphocytes, reducing immune-tolerant lymphocytes while increasing activated natural killer and dendritic cells. Similar effectiveness was observed in human RCC tumors when RCT001 was combined with anti-PD-1 treatment. RCT001, by inhibiting CXCR2 through its unique mechanism, effectively suppresses ccRCC cell proliferation, angiogenesis, and M2 macrophage polarization. This optimization potentiates the efficacy of immunotherapy and holds promise for significantly improving the survival prospects of metastatic ccRCC patients.",Montemagno C; Jacquel A; Rastoin O; Dawaliby R; Schmitt T; Bourgoin M; Palenzuela H; Ambrosetti D; Durivault J; Borchiellini D; Le Du J; Gonçalves LCP; Auberger P; Benhida R; Ronco C,Biomedical Department; INSERM U1065/C3M; G.CLIPS Biotech; Roca Therapeutics; Department of Pathology; Centre Antoine Lacassagne,mdufies@unice.fr.

Levodopa infusion strategies might provide more consistent drug delivery and fewer motor fluctuations. We aimed to assess the safety and efficacy of a continuous 24 h/day subcutaneous infusion of ND0612 (a levodopa-carbidopa solution) compared with oral immediate-release levodopa-carbidopa for the treatment of motor fluctuations in people with Parkinson's disease. We conducted a phase 3, randomised, double-blind, double-dummy, active-controlled, multicentre trial at 117 academic and community neurology sites in 16 countries, including in Europe, Israel, and the USA. Eligible participants were men and women aged 30 years or older with a diagnosis of Parkinson's disease (Hoehn and Yahr stage ≤3 in the on state) who experienced at least 2·5 h/day of off time. Participants underwent an open-label run-in phase (<12 weeks), during which time optimal regimens were established for both oral immediate-release levodopa-carbidopa and for 24 h/day subcutaneous ND0612 infusion (levodopa-carbidopa 60·0/7·5 mg/mL), with supplemental oral levodopa-carbidopa if needed. Participants were then randomly assigned (1:1) to 12 weeks of double-blind treatment with their optimised regimen of either subcutaneous ND0612 or oral levodopa-carbidopa, with matching oral or subcutaneous placebo given as required to maintain blinding. Randomisation was done via an interactive web response system, stratified by region, using a permuted block schedule. Participants, study partners, treating investigators, study site personnel, and the sponsor were masked to treatment group allocation. The primary efficacy endpoint was the change from baseline (ie, time of randomisation, when all patients were receiving an optimised open-label ND0612 regimen) to end of the double-blind phase in total daily on time without troublesome dyskinesia, analysed by intention to treat. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04006210, and is complete. Between Sept 30, 2019, and April 8, 2022, 381 participants were enrolled, of whom 259 (68%) were randomly assigned, 128 (49%) to subcutaneous ND0612 and 131 (51%) to oral levodopa-carbidopa. 243 (94%) participants completed the study. Treatment with subcutaneous ND0612 provided an additional 1·72 h (95% CI 1·08 to 2·36) of on time without troublesome dyskinesia compared with oral levodopa-carbidopa (change from baseline of -0·48 h [-0·94 to -0·02] with subcutaneous ND0612 vs -2·20 h [-2·65 to -1·74] with oral levodopa-carbidopa; p<0·0001). Significant treatment differences favouring subcutaneous ND0612 were also found in the first four of nine prespecified hierarchical outcomes of daily off time (-1·40 h [95% CI -1·99 to -0·80]), Movement Disorders Society-Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale part II scores (-3·05 [-4·28 to -1·81]), Patients Global Impression of Change (odds ratio [OR] 5·31 [2·67 to 10·58]), and Clinical Global Impression of Improvement (OR 7·23 [3·57 to 14·64]). Hierarchical testing ended after the fourth secondary endpoint. Adverse events were reported by 287 (89%) of 322 participants during open-label ND0612 optimisation, and by 103 (80%) of 128 in the ND0612 group and 97 (74%) of 131 in the oral levodopa-carbidopa group during the double-blind phase. The most common adverse events were infusion-site reactions (266 [83%] participants during open-label ND0612, and 73 [57%] in the ND0612 group vs 56 [43%] in the oral levodopa-carbidopa group during the double-blind phase), most of which were mild. Serious adverse events in four participants in the ND0612 group were related to study treatment (infusion-site cellulitis [n=2], infusion-site abscess and infusion-site ulcer [n=1]; and paraesthesia and peripheral sensorimotor neuropathy [n=1]). One participant in the ND0612 group died during the double-blind phase, but the death was not related to study treatment (fall leading to traumatic brain injury). Results of this phase 3 study showed that subcutaneous ND0612 used in combination with oral immediate-release levodopa-carbidopa increased on time without troublesome dyskinesia and reduced off time, with a favourable benefit-risk profile.

Least squares mean change in caudate volume was 3·10% (SE 0·38) in the 1·0 mg group and 4·86% (0·38) in the placebo group (least squares mean difference -1·76% [95% CI -2·67 to -0·85]; p=0·0002). Laquinimod was well tolerated and there were no new safety findings. Serious adverse events were reported by eight (7%) patients on placebo, seven (7%) on laquinimod 0·5 mg, five (5%) on laquinimod 1·0 mg, and one (3%) on laquinimod 1·5 mg. There was one death, which occurred in the placebo group and was unrelated to treatment. The most frequent adverse events in all laquinimod dosed groups (0·5 mg, 1·0 mg, and 1·5 mg) were headache (38 [16%]), diarrhoea (24 [10%]), fall (18 [7%]), nasopharyngitis (20 [8%]), influenza (15 [6%]), vomiting (13 [5%]), arthralgia (11 [5%]), irritability (ten [4%]), fatigue (eight [3%]), and insomnia (eight [3%]). Laquinimod did not show a significant effect on motor symptoms assessed by the UHDRS-TMS, but significantly reduced caudate volume loss compared with placebo at week 52. Huntington's disease has a chronic and slowly progressive course, and this study does not address whether a longer duration of laquinimod treatment could have produced detectable and meaningful changes in the clinical assessments.

To identify key proteome signatures and biological processes accompanying the development of persistent AF through integrated proteomics and bioinformatics analysis. Atrial tissue samples from three CREM-Tg mice and three wild-type littermates were subjected to unbiased mass spectrometry-based quantitative proteomics, differential expression and pathway enrichment analysis, and protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analysis. A total of 98 differentially expressed proteins were identified. Gene ontology analysis revealed enrichment for biological processes regulating actin cytoskeleton organization and extracellular matrix (ECM) dynamics. Changes in ITGAV, FBLN5, and LCP1 were identified as being relevant to atrial fibrosis and remodeling based on expression changes, co-expression patterns, and PPI network analysis. Comparative analysis with previously published datasets revealed a shift in protein expression patterns from ion-channel and metabolic regulators in young CREM-Tg mice to profibrotic remodeling factors in older CREM-Tg mice. Furthermore, older CREM-Tg mice exhibited protein expression patterns that resembled those of humans with persistent AF. This study uncovered distinct temporal changes in atrial protein expression patterns with age in CREM-Tg mice consistent with the progressive evolution of AF. Future studies into the role of the key differentially abundant proteins identified in this study in AF progression may open new therapeutic avenues to control atrial fibrosis and substrate development in AF.",,,

This is largely driven by factors such as a surge in biosimilars as patents expire, an aging population, and a rise in chronic diseases. With these market demands, pressure upon biomanufacturers to produce quality products with rapid turnaround escalates proportionally. Process intensification in biomanufacturing has been well received and accepted across industry based on the demonstration of its benefits of improved productivity and efficiency, while also reducing the cost of goods. However, while these benefits have been shown empirically, the challenges of adopting process intensification into industry remain, from smaller independent start-up to big pharma. Traditionally, moving from batch to a process intensification scheme has been viewed as an ""all or nothing"" approach involving continuous bioprocessing, in which the factors of complexity and significant capital costs hinder its adoption. In addition, the literature is crowded with a variety of terms used to describe process intensification (continuous, periodic counter-current, connected, intensified, steady-state, etc.). Often, these terms are used inappropriately or as synonyms, which generates confusion in the field. Through a detailed review of current state-of-the-art systems, consumables, and process intensification case studies, we herein propose a defined approach in the implementation of downstream process intensification through a standardized nomenclature and viewing it as distinct independent levels. These can function separately as intensified single-unit operations or be built upon by integration with other process steps allowing for simple, incremental, cost-effective implementation of process intensification in the manufacturing of biopharmaceuticals.",Crowley L; Cashen P; Noverraz M; Lobedann M; Nestola P,Sartorius Stedim Biotech GmbH; Sartorius Stedim North America Inc,

Current treatments are aimed at restoring sinus rhythm through catheter ablation and rate and rhythm control, but these treatments do not target the underlying molecular mechanisms driving the progression from AF to AIC. Here, we describe the clinical features of the various AIC subtypes, discuss the pathophysiologic mechanisms driving the progression from AF to AIC, and review the evidence surrounding current treatment options.

India is one of the largest global consumers of antibiotics and has one of the highest rates of resistance to antimicrobial treatments. However, the epidemiology of antibiotic treatment among young children in India is poorly understood. Using nationally representative household survey data from the Indian National Family Health Surveys (NFHS) conducted between 2015 and 2016 and 2019 and 2021, we estimated the prevalence of antibiotic use among 17 472 children under the age of three who reported ARI symptoms within two weeks before their mothers were interviewed. To assess the factors associated with antibiotic use for the treatment of ARI symptoms, we used multivariable logistic regression models that included sociodemographic, child-related, household, and health care related characteristics, with results reported on the prevalence difference (PD) scale. We estimated that 18.7% (95% CI = 17.8-19.6) of under-three-year-old (U3) children who exhibited ARI symptoms in the two weeks prior to the survey were given antibiotics as a treatment. The highest prevalence was observed in the southern and northern geographic zones of India. Furthermore, multivariable regression models indicated that children with greater access to health services were more likely to receive antibiotics for ARI treatment, regardless of the type of health care facility (public, private or pharmacy/unregulated). Additionally, the prevalence of antibiotic consumption was higher among children from families with religious affiliations other than Muslim and Hindu backgrounds (i.e. Christian, Sikh, Buddhist/neo-Buddhist, Jain, Jewish, Parsi, no religion and other) (PD = 11.7 (95% CI = 6.3-16.7)) compared to Hindu families and among mothers with a secondary or higher education (PD = 5.8 (95% CI = 1.7-9.9)) compared to mothers lacking formal education.

Retinaldehyde dehydrogenase 1 (RALDH1), RALDH2, and RALDH3 are the three isozymes that catalyze RA biosynthesis. In this study, we have identified RALDH1 as the key driver of RA production in HCC and demonstrated the efficacy of RALDH1-selective inhibitors (Raldh1-INH) in suppressing RA production by HCC cells. Raldh1-INH restrained tumor growth in multiple mouse models of HCC by reducing the number and tumor-supporting functions of intratumoral macrophages as well as increasing T-cell infiltration and activation within tumors.

The aim of this retrospective cohort study was to evaluate the impact of a digital mental health benefit (Spring Health) on frontline healthcare service workers' clinical and workplace outcomes. The benefit was sponsored by a national health services company from 2021-2022 and included mental health screening, care navigation, psychotherapy and/or medication management. We hypothesized program use would be associated with improvements in depression and anxiety symptoms, and increased productivity and retention. Participants were employees enrolled in the benefit program, had at least moderate anxiety or depression, at least 1 treatment appointment, and at least 2 outcome assessments. Clinical improvement measures were PHQ-9 scale (range, 0-27) for depression and GAD-7 scale (range, 0-21) for anxiety; workplace measures were employee retention and the Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS) for functional impairment. A total of 686 participants were included. Participants using the mental health benefit had a 5.60 point (95% CI, 4.40-6.79, d = 1.28) reduction in depression and a 5.48 point (95% CI, 3.88-7.08, d = 1.64) reduction in anxiety across 6 months. 69.9% (95% CI, 61.8%-78.1%) of participants reliably improved (≥5 point change) and 84.1% (95% CI, 78.2%-90.1%) achieved reliable improvement or recovery (<10 points).

With the emergence of new devices for assessing PWV, it has become evident that some of these devices yield results that display significant discrepancies compared with previous devices. This discrepancy underscores the importance of comprehensive validation procedures and the need for international recommendations. A stepwise approach utilizing the modified Delphi technique, with the involvement of key scientific societies dedicated to arterial stiffness research worldwide, was adopted to formulate, through a multidisciplinary vision, a shared approach to the validation of noninvasive arterial PWV measurement devices. A set of recommendations has been developed, which aim to provide guidance to clinicians, researchers, and device manufacturers regarding the validation of new PWV measurement devices. The intention behind these recommendations is to ensure that the validation process can be conducted in a rigorous and consistent manner and to promote standardization and harmonization among PWV devices, thereby facilitating their widespread adoption in clinical practice. It is hoped that these recommendations will encourage both users and developers of PWV measurement devices to critically evaluate and validate their technologies, ultimately leading to improved consistency and comparability of results.

Factors that can alter immune response, including significantly altered cytokine levels in plasma and polarization of macrophages and T cells towards a pro-reparative phenotype in the myocardium post-MI is a valid strategy for reducing infarct size and damage after myocardial injury. Our previous studies showed that cortical bone stem cells (CBSCs) possess reparative effects after ICI.

Serine proteases form cascades of sequentially activated enzymes that direct thrombosis (clot formation) and thrombolysis (clot dissolution), complement activation in immune responses and also programmed cell death (apoptosis). Virus-derived serpins have co-evolved with mammalian proteases and serpins, developing into highly effective inhibitors of mammalian proteolytic pathways. Through interacting with extracellular and intracellular serine and cysteine proteases, viral serpins provide a new class of highly active virus-derived coagulation-, immune-, and apoptosis-modulating drug candidates. Viral serpins have unique characteristics: (1) function at micrograms per kilogram doses; (2) selectivity in targeting sites of protease activation; (3) minimal side effects at active concentrations; and (4) the demonstrated capacity to be modified, or fine-tuned, for altered protease targeting. To date, the virus-derived serpin class of biologics has proven effective in a wide range of animal models and in one clinical trial in patients with unstable coronary disease.

Furthermore, and critically so, significant long-term sustained investment in human resources must be adopted to fill major gaps in expertise, starting with a robust educational system whose graduates have the knowledge, ability, and capacity to work in this technical industry. Only then, with a professional-educated labor force, can resilient pharma-manufacturing clusters be successfully built throughout the world, which can, and will, give life to the new health code: ""No one is safe, until everyone is safe.""",Pan G,Independent researcher,jenik_radon@radonoffices.com.

We use the specific example of Unravel Biosciences-a therapeutics platform company that identifies novel drug targets through off-target mechanisms of existing drugs and then develops optimized new molecules-throughout the paper and explore a specific scenario of drug repurposing for rare genetic diseases. The first challenge consists of producing a realistic financial valuation of a potential rare disease repurposed drug compound, in this case targeting Rett syndrome. More generally, we develop a framework to value a portfolio of pairwise correlated rare disease compounds in early-stage development and quantify its risk profile. We estimate the probability of a negative return to be [Formula: see text] for a single compound and [Formula: see text] for a portfolio of 8 drugs. The probability of selling the project at a loss decreases from [Formula: see text] (phase 3) for a single compound to [Formula: see text] (phase 3) for the 8-drug portfolio. For the second challenge, we find that the choice of operating model and corporate structure is crucial for early-stage biotech startups and illustrate this point with three concrete examples. Repurposing existing compounds offers important advantages that could help early-stage biotech startups better align their business and financing issues with their scientific and medical objectives, enter a space that is not occupied by large pharmaceutical companies, and accelerate the validation of their drug development platform.",Ben Chaouch Z,Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science,alo-admin@mit.edu.

In this study, we isolated a new cypovirus from naturally diseased Clanis bilineata larvae (named CbCPV), scanned its structure, sequenced its genome, and studied its phylogenetic relationship to other cypoviruses. Microscopy showed that CbCPV polyhedral occlusion bodies were about 1.878 μm on average and contained many virions in the ultrathin sections. The complete genome sequence of CbCPV is 22,812 bp comprising 10 segmented double-stranded RNAs. Apart from segment 1 containing one open reading frame (ORF) and one sub-ORF, the other nine segments all contain one open reading frame and encoded one putative protein. The non-coding regions contained conserved sequences at 5' termini (AGUCAAA) and 3' termini (AGC), except segment 4 containing a different 5' termini (AUGUUUA). The whole sequence of the polyhedrin gene in CbCPV contained 892 nucleotides, encoding a protein of 246 amino acids. Based on amino acid sequences of polyhedrin or RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), the phylogenetic analysis indicated that CbCPV was closely related to DnCPV-23. The putative function of all segments differed from each other, but the most closely related species of segments were DnCPV-23 with 98.2-99.8% nucleotide identity. Overall, the evidence of morphology, protein analysis and nucleic acids (genomic pattern) showed that CbCPV is a new isolate in the cypovirus-23 type and can be termed Clanis bilineata cypovirus type 23 (CbCPV-23).",Liu Z; Deng Z,Jiangxi New Dragon Biotech Corp.; Jiangxi Academy of Sciences,zgzhan_iom@163.com.

Therefore, it is advantageous to know the interaction pattern between antibodies and their antigens. Regions on the antigen which are recognized by the antibodies are called epitopes, and the respective molecular counterpart of the epitope on the mAbs is called paratope. These epitopes can have many different compositions and/or structures. Knowing the epitope is a valuable information for the development or improvement of biological products, e.g., diagnostic assays, therapeutic mAbs, and vaccines, as well as for the elucidation of immune responses. Most of the techniques for epitope mapping rely on the presentation of the target, or parts of it, in a way that it can interact with a certain mAb. Among the techniques used for epitope mapping, phage display is a versatile technology that allows the display of a library of oligopeptides or fragments from a single gene product on the phage surface, which then can interact with several antibodies to define epitopes. In this chapter, a protocol for the construction of a single-target oligopeptide phage library, as well as for the panning procedure for epitope mapping using phage display is given.",Steinke S; Roth KDR; Englick R; Langreder N; Ballmann R; Fühner V; Zilkens KJK; Moreira GMSG; Koch A; Azzali F; Russo G; Schubert M; Bertoglio F; Heine PA; Hust M,Abcalis GmbH; Institut für Biochemie,m.hust@tu-braunschweig.de.

On the one hand, robust, acute, and resolving type I IFN responses have been shown to mediate prominent anticancer effects, reflecting not only their direct cytostatic/cytotoxic activity on (at least some) malignant cells, but also their pronounced immunostimulatory functions. In line with this notion, type I IFN signaling has been implicated in the antineoplastic effects of various immunogenic therapeutics, including (but not limited to) immunogenic cell death (ICD)-inducing agents and immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). On the other hand, weak, indolent, and non-resolving type I IFN responses have been demonstrated to support tumor progression and resistance to therapy, reflecting the ability of suboptimal type I IFN signaling to mediate cytoprotective activity, promote stemness, favor tolerance to chromosomal instability, and facilitate the establishment of an immunologically exhausted tumor microenvironment.

It provides data about the effectiveness and safety of an intervention from outside the randomised controlled trial (RCT) setting and allows healthcare professionals (HCPs) to determine if RCT data are applicable to their patients in routine clinical practice. This review provides a discussion of the value of RWE in T2D management in day-to-day clinical practice, with a focus on RWE with sulfonylureas (SUs), and presents two examples of a new generation of international real-world studies in people with T2D managed in routine clinical practice. RWE plays a valuable role in advising HCPs in the day-to-day management of T2D, informing regulatory authorities with regard to pharmacovigilance and post-approval updates, and providing insights with regard to patients' treatment adherence and preference. RWE should be used alongside RCTs to increase HCP awareness and understanding of their patients' perspectives, potentially allowing for improvements in treatment adherence, glycaemic control and health-related quality of life (HRQoL). In addition, real-world studies must be conducted in a way that generates robust RWE by limiting the risks of bias and confounding as much as possible. A growing body of RWE is emerging from Asia. For example, in a preliminary HRQoL analysis of the Joint Asia Diabetes Evaluation (JADE) Register, Asian people with T2D had better HRQoL with gliclazide-based treatment than with other SU agents, despite being older and having more diabetes-related complications.",Almalki M,King Fahad Medical City,kk22@leicester.ac.uk.

The vaginal microbiome has been associated with PTB, yet the mechanisms underlying this association are not fully understood. Understanding microbial genetic adaptations to selective pressures, especially those related to the host, may yield insights into these associations. Here, we analyze metagenomic data from 705 vaginal samples collected during pregnancy from 40 women who delivered preterm spontaneously and 135 term controls from the Multi-Omic Microbiome Study-Pregnancy Initiative. We find that the vaginal microbiome of pregnancies that ended preterm exhibited unique genetic profiles. It was more genetically diverse at the species level, a result which we validate in an additional cohort, and harbored a higher richness and diversity of antimicrobial resistance genes, likely promoted by transduction. Interestingly, we find that Gardnerella species drove this higher genetic diversity, particularly during the first half of the pregnancy. We further present evidence that Gardnerella spp. underwent more frequent recombination and stronger purifying selection in genes involved in lipid metabolism. Overall, our population genetics analyses reveal associations between the vaginal microbiome and PTB and suggest that evolutionary processes acting on vaginal microbes may play a role in adverse pregnancy outcomes such as PTB.",,,liaoj@vt.edu.

Most large and small animal disease models of HF are based on surgical procedures. A common surgical technique to induce HF is transverse aortic constriction (TAC), which induces pressure overload. The conventional TAC (cTAC) procedure is a highly invasive surgery that is associated with severe inflammation and excessive perioperative deaths. To establish an improved, minimally invasive TAC (mTAC) procedure that does not require thoracotomy. Following anesthesia, mice were intubated, and a small incision was made at the neck and chest. After cutting the sternum about 4 mm, the aortic arch was approached without opening the pleural cavity. A suture was placed between the brachiocephalic artery and the left common carotid artery. This model was associated with low perioperative mortality and a highly reproducible constriction evidenced by an increased right-to-left carotid blood flow velocity ratio in mTAC mice (5.9 ± 0.2)  Our data show that the mTAC procedure yields a highly reproducible phenotype consisting of LV contractile dysfunction and enlargement, combined with left atrial enlargement and diastolic dysfunction.

Here utilizing the endocytic feature of the cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen-4 (CTLA-4) cytoplasmic tail, we reprogram CAR function and substantially enhance CAR-T efficacy in vivo. CAR-T cells with monomeric, duplex or triplex CTLA-4 cytoplasmic tails (CCTs) fused to the C terminus of CAR exhibit a progressive increase in cytotoxicity under repeated stimulation, accompanied by reduced activation and production of proinflammatory cytokines. Further characterization reveals that CARs with increasing CCT fusion show a progressively lower surface expression, regulated by their constant endocytosis, recycling and degradation under steady state. The molecular dynamics of reengineered CAR with CCT fusion results in reduced CAR-mediated trogocytosis, loss of tumor antigen and improved CAR-T survival. CARs with either monomeric (CAR-1CCT) or duplex CCTs (CAR-2CCT) have superior antitumor efficacy in a relapsed leukemia model. Single-cell RNA sequencing and flow cytometry analysis reveal that CAR-2CCT cells retain a stronger central memory phenotype and exhibit increased persistence. These findings illuminate a unique strategy for engineering therapeutic T cells and improving CAR-T function through synthetic CCT fusion, which is orthogonal to other cell engineering techniques.",,,sidi.chen@yale.edu.

This U-turn in recommendations from the previous 2007 guideline is controversial.We suggest that the controversy stems from anomalies in both processing and interpretation of the evidence by the NICE committee. The committee: (1) created a new definition of CFS/ME, which 'downgraded' the certainty of trial evidence; (2) omitted data from standard trial end points used to assess efficacy; (3) discounted trial data when assessing treatment harm in favour of lower quality surveys and qualitative studies; (4) minimised the importance of fatigue as an outcome; (5) did not use accepted practices to synthesise trial evidence adequately using GRADE (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations trial evidence); (6) interpreted GET as mandating fixed increments of change when trials defined it as collaborative, negotiated and symptom dependent; (7) deviated from NICE recommendations of rehabilitation for related conditions, such as chronic primary pain and (8) recommended an energy management approach in the absence of supportive research evidence.We conclude that the dissonance between this and the previous guideline was the result of deviating from usual scientific standards of the NICE process.

It is widely planting in southern China, and in greenhouses throughout the country. In Mar 2022, symptoms of a viral-like infection were observed on the leaves of passion fruit plants in a 3-hectare greenhouse complex in Hohhot, China. Chlorotic lesions were observed on leaves of two vines of passion fruit and symptomatic leaves developed chlorotic spots, followed by systemic leaf chlorosis and necrosis. Dark ringed spots emerged on the surface of matured fruits (Figure 1). To confirm infectivity, mechanical transmission of the virus was performed by grinding leaves from two symptomatic passion fruit vines in 0.1M phosphate buffer pH 7, and the resulting two samples were each used to rub-inoculate carborundum-dusted leaves of three healthy passion fruit seedlings. Newly emerging leaves of inoculated plants developed mild mosaic symptoms 30-days after inoculation. Three samples from each of the two original symptomatic plants and two samples from each inoculated seedling tested positive using a Passiflora latent virus (PLV) ELISA Kit (Creative Diagnostics, USA). To further confirm the virus identity, total RNA from leaf samples from one of the original greenhouse symptomatic plants and one of the inoculated seedlings were extracted using an TaKaRa MiniBEST Viral RNA Extraction Kit (Takara, Japan). The two RNA samples were subjected to reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests with virus specific primers PLV-F (5'-ACACAAAACTGCGTGTTGGA-3') and PLV-R (5'-CAAGACCCACCTACCTCAGTGTG-3') (Cho et al., 2020). RT-PCR products of the expected 571 bp were obtained from both the original greenhouse sample and inoculated seedling. Amplicons were cloned into the pGEM-T Easy Vector, and two clones per sample were Sanger sequenced bidirectionally (Sangon Biotech, China), and the sequence of one clone from one of the original symptomatic sample was uploaded to NCBI (GenBank OP320922.1). This accession had 98% nucleotide sequence identity with a PLV isolate from Korea (GenBank: LC556232.1). RNA extracts from two asymptomatic samples tested negative for PLV with both ELISA and RT-PCR tests. We also tested the original symptomatic sample for common occurring passion fruit viruses, including passion fruit woodiness virus (PWV), cucumber mosaic virus (CMV), east asian passiflora virus (EAPV), telosma mosaic virus (TeMV), papaya leaf curl Guangdong virus (PaLCuGdV), and the RT-PCR results were negative for those viruses. However, based on the systemic leaf chlorosis and necrosis symptoms, we cannot preclude a mixed infestation of other viruses. PLV affects fruit quality and has high potential to reduce market value.

Strategic editing of the MOGS gene in T lymphocytes and myeloid origin cells harboring latent proviral DNA results in the production of non-infectious particles upon treatment of cells with latency reversal agents. Controlled activation of CRISPR-MOGS by rebound HIV-1 mitigates production of infectious particles that exhibit poor ability of the virus to penetrate uninfected cells. Moreover, exclusive activation of CRISPR in cells infected with HIV-1 alleviates concern for broad off-target impact of MOGS gene ablation in uninfected cells. Combination CRISPR treatment of peripheral blood lymphocytes prepared from blood of people with HIV-1 (PWH) tailored for editing the MOGS gene (CRISPR-MOGS) and proviral HIV-1 DNA (CRISPR-HIV) revealed a cooperative impact of CRISPR treatment in inhibiting the production of infectious HIV-1 particles.

Here we discuss the mechanisms that underlie the physiologic and pathologic actions of FGF23, with focus on its FGF receptors (FGFR) and co-receptors. Klotho is a transmembrane protein that acts as an FGFR co-receptor for FGF23 on physiologic target cells. Klotho also exists as a circulating variant, and recent studies suggested that soluble klotho (sKL) can mediate FGF23 effects in cells that do not express klotho. Furthermore, it has been assumed that the actions of FGF23 do not require heparan sulfate (HS), a proteoglycan that acts as a co-receptor for other FGF isoforms. However, recent studies revealed that HS can be part of the FGF23:FGFR signaling complex and modulate FGF23-induced effects. sKL and HS have appeared as circulating FGFR co-receptors that modulate the actions of FGF23. Experimental studies suggest that sKL protects from and HS accelerates CKD-associated heart injury. However, the in vivo relevance of these findings is still speculative.",Li Q; Faul C,,

In 5,230 Chinese patients (47.6% men) with T2D (mean ± SD age: 56.5 ± 13.9 years; median diabetes duration: 6 [interquartile range 1, 12] years), enrolled consecutively in 1996-2012 and prospectively observed until 2019, we retrospectively measured fasting CP and GADA in stored serum and examined their associations with aforementioned outcomes. At baseline, 28.6% (n = 1,494) had low CP (<200 pmol/L) and 4.9% (n = 257) had positive GADA (GADA+). In the low-CP group, 8.0% had GADA+, and, in the GADA+ group, 46.3% had low CP. The GADA+ group had an adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) of 1.46 (95% CI 1.15-1.84, P = 0.002) for insulin initiation versus the GADA- group, while the low-CP group had an aHR of 0.88 (0.77-1.00, P = 0.051) versus the high-CP group. Following insulin initiation, the GADA+ plus low-CP group had the largest decrements in HbA1c (-1.9% at month 6; -1.5% at month 12 vs. -1% in the other three groups). The aHR of severe hypoglycemia was 1.29 (95% CI 1.10-1.52, P = 0.002) in the low-CP group and 1.38 (95% CI 1.04-1.83, P = 0.024) in the GADA+ group. There is considerable heterogeneity in autoimmunity and β-cell dysfunction in T2D with GADA+ and high CP associated with early insulin initiation, while GADA+ and low CP, increased the risk of severe hypoglycemia.

However, they have had less success in controlling endemic pathogens including Mycobacterium tuberculosis, herpesviruses and HIV. A focus on vaccine-mediated generation of neutralizing antibodies, which has been a successful approach for some pathogens, has been complicated by the emergence of escape variants, which has been seen for pathogens such as influenza viruses and SARS-CoV-2, as well as for HIV-1. We discuss how vaccination strategies aimed at generating a broad and robust T cell response may offer superior protection against pathogens, particularly those that have been observed to mutate rapidly. In particular, we consider here how a focus on generating resident memory T cells may be uniquely effective for providing immunity to pathogens that typically infect (or become reactivated in) the skin, respiratory mucosa or other barrier tissues.",,,tkupper@bwh.harvard.edu.

We aimed to improve this therapy by optimizing both the antibodies and their delivery route, using small monodomain antibodies (nanobodies) delivered locally with a self-amplifying RNA (saRNA) vector based on Semliki Forest virus (SFV). We generated nanobodies against PD-1 and PD-L1 able to inhibit both human and mouse interactions. Incorporation of a dimerization domain reduced PD-1/PD-L1 IC50 by 8- and 40-fold for anti-PD-L1 and anti-PD-1 nanobodies, respectively. SFV viral particles expressing dimeric nanobodies showed a potent antitumor response in the MC38 model, resulting in >50% complete regressions, and showed better therapeutic efficacy compared to vectors expressing conventional antibodies. These effects were also observed in the B16 melanoma model. Although a short-term expression of nanobodies was observed due to the cytopathic nature of the saRNA vector, it was enough to generate a strong proinflammatory response in tumors, increasing infiltration of NK and CD8",Silva-Pilipich N; Blanco E; Lozano T; Martisova E; Igea A; Herrador-Cañete G; Ballesteros-Briones MC; Gorraiz M; Sarrión P; González-Sapienza G; Lasarte JJ; Vanrell L; Smerdou C,Cátedra de Inmunología; Facultad de Ingeniería; Division of Gene Therapy and Regulation of Gene Expression; Program of Immunology and Immunotherapy,lvanrell@nanogrowbiotech.com.

However, the pharmacological response to a given immunosuppressant can vary markedly between individuals, with some showing poor treatment responses and/or experiencing serious side effects. There is an unmet need for diagnostic tools that allow clinicians to individually tailor immunosuppressive therapy to a patient's immunological profile. The Immunobiogram (IMBG) is a novel blood-based in vitro diagnostic test that provides a pharmacodynamic readout of the immune response of individual patients to a range of immunosuppressants commonly used in kidney transplant recipients. Here, we discuss the current approaches used to measure the pharmacodynamic responses of individual patients to specific immunosuppressive drugs in vitro, which can then be correlated with patient's clinical outcomes. We also describe the procedure of the IMBG assay, and summarize the results obtained using the IMBG in different kidney transplant populations.

Oral vaccines delivered by drenching are less likely to be used due to a lack of labor on farms. Current environmental enrichment (EE) technologies do not allow pigs to express certain natural behaviors such as rooting and getting a reward. We developed a sprayer so that domestic pigs can self-apply any liquid. By adding an attractant (pig maternal pheromone), the use of EE devices by individual pigs can be increased. In this study, we used a Salmonella oral vaccine to evaluate efficacy of three delivery methods: (1) Control, no vaccine, (2) hand drenching as labeled, and (3) self-administration by this EE rooting device. All pigs sprayed themselves within 80 min of exposure to the EE device. While control pigs had little or no Salmonella serum and oral fluid IgG or IgA, hand-drenched and self-vaccinated pigs built similar levels of both serum and oral fluid IgA and IgG. We conclude we were able to significantly reduce human labor needed and achieved 100% efficacy in eliciting a serologic response when pigs self-administered a Salmonella vaccine. This technology could benefit commercial pig production while providing an enriched behavioral environment.

This gain-of-function (GOF) framework posited that proteins become toxic when turned into amyloids (pathology), predicting that lowering its levels would translate into clinical benefits. Genetic observations used to support a GOF framework are equally compatible with a loss-of-function (LOF) framework, as the soluble pool of proteins rendered unstable by these mutations (e.g., APP in Alzheimer's disease, SNCA in Parkinson's disease) aggregate, becoming depleted. In this review, we highlight misconceptions that have prevented LOF from gaining currency. Some of these misconceptions include no phenotype in knock-out animals (there is neurodegenerative phenotype in knock-out animals) and high levels of proteins in patients (patients have lower levels of the proteins involved in neurodegeneration than healthy age-matched controls). We also expose the internal contradictions within the GOF framework, namely that (1) pathology can have both pathogenic and protective roles; (2) the neuropathology gold standard for diagnosis can be present in normal individuals and absent in those affected; (3) oligomers are the toxic species even if they are ephemeral and decrease over time. We therefore advocate for a paradigm shift from proteinopathy (GOF) to proteinopenia (LOF) based on the universal depletion of soluble functional proteins in neurodegenerative diseases (low amyloid-β 42 in Alzheimer's disease, low α-synuclein in Parkinson's disease, and low tau in progressive supranuclear palsy) and supported by the confluence of biologic, thermodynamic, and evolutionary principles with proteins having evolved to perform a function, not to become toxic, and where protein depletion is consequential. Such shift to a Proteinopenia paradigm is necessary to examining the safety and efficacy of protein replacement strategies instead of perpetuating a therapeutic paradigm with further antiprotein permutations.",,,kariem.ezzat.ahmed@ki.se.

Postulated nearly four decades ago, the search for the mechanism behind the conformational templating has proceeded to no avail. Here, we extend the thermodynamic hypothesis of protein folding (Anfinsen's dogma) to the amyloid phenomenon and illustrate that the amyloid conformation (cross-β) is one of two conformational states that are thermodynamically accessible to any protein sequence depending on concentration. A protein spontaneously assumes its native conformation below supersaturation and the amyloid cross-β conformation above supersaturation. The information to adopt the native conformation and the amyloid conformation is present in the primary sequence and the backbone of the protein, respectively, and does not require templating. The rate-limiting step for proteins to adopt the cross-β conformation of amyloid is termed nucleation, which can be catalyzed by surfaces (heterogeneous nucleation) or preformed amyloid fragments (seeding). Irrespective of the nucleation pathway, once triggered, amyloid formation proceeds spontaneously in fractal-like fashion, where the surfaces of the growing fibrils act as heterogeneous nucleation catalysts for new fibrils, a phenomenon known as secondary nucleation. This pattern is in contrast to the linear growth assumptions that the prion hypothesis necessitates for faithful prion strain replication. Additionally, the cross-β conformation buries the majority of the protein side chain inside the fibrils, making the fibrils inert, generic, and extremely stable. As such, the source of toxicity in prion disorders may come to a greater extent from the loss of proteins in their normal, soluble, and therefore functional state rather than from their transformation into stable, insoluble, nonfunctioning amyloids.",,,kariem.ezzat.ahmed@ki.se.

According to it, clinical manifestations are defined and explained by a given pathology, that is, by the burden and distribution of selected proteins aggregated into insoluble amyloids. There are two logical consequences from this model: (1) a measurement of the disease-defining pathology represents a biomarker of that disease in everyone affected, and (2) the targeted elimination of that pathology should end that disease. But success in disease modification guided by this model has remained elusive. New technologies to probe living biology have been used to validate rather than question the clinicopathologic model, despite three important observations: (1) a disease-defining pathology in isolation (without other pathologies) is an exceptional autopsy finding; (2) many genetic and molecular pathways converge on the same pathology; (3) the presence of pathology without neurological disease is more common than expected by chance. We here discuss the rationale for abandoning the clinicopathologic model, review the competing biological model of neurodegeneration, and propose developmental pathways for biomarker development and disease-modifying efforts. Further, in justifying future disease-modifying trials testing putative neuroprotective molecules, a key inclusion criterion must be the deployment of a bioassay of the mechanism corrected by the therapy of interest. No improvements in trial design or execution can overcome the fundamental deficit created by testing experimental therapies in clinically defined recipients unselected for their biologically suitability.

The low complexity of the neonatal buccal microbiome is a hallmark of maternal and neonatal health, but that of the neonatal gastrointestinal microbiome is associated with maternal inflammation-related metabolites. Microbial infections in the maternal reproductive tract universally impact the complexity of the neonatal microbiomes, and the body site is most important in modulating the composition of the neonatal microbiomes.

The sudden emergence of this target area in the pipelines of many biotech start-ups and even large pharmaceutical companies appears even more surprising when considering that the involvement of the complement system in various clinical conditions had long been recognized. In many aspects, however, the complement system is far from being a traditional drug target, which may explain the delayed breakthrough of this therapeutic strategy. While complement modulation is now considered an attractive ""platform technology"" with applications in a wide spectrum of disorders, the broad yet heterogeneous disease involvement of the complement system has long restricted its placement in traditional drug discovery programs. Concerns about the safety of complement-targeted interventions, the large number and high plasma concentrations of target proteins, and the complexity of the complement system's engagement in biological processes are among other factors that kept complement off the drug discovery radar for decades.

The vaginal microbiome has been associated with PTB, yet the mechanisms underlying this association are not fully understood. Understanding microbial genetic adaptations to selective pressures, especially those related to the host, may yield new insights into these associations. To this end, we analyzed metagenomic data from 705 vaginal samples collected longitudinally during pregnancy from 40 women who delivered preterm spontaneously and 135 term controls from the Multi-Omic Microbiome Study-Pregnancy Initiative (MOMS-PI). We find that the vaginal microbiome of pregnancies that ended preterm exhibits unique genetic profiles. It is more genetically diverse at the species level, a result which we validate in an additional cohort, and harbors a higher richness and diversity of antimicrobial resistance genes, likely promoted by transduction. Interestingly, we find that Gardnerella species, a group of central vaginal pathobionts, are driving this higher genetic diversity, particularly during the first half of the pregnancy. We further present evidence that Gardnerella spp. undergoes more frequent recombination and stronger purifying selection in genes involved in lipid metabolism. Overall, our results reveal novel associations between the vaginal microbiome and PTB using population genetics analyses, and suggest that evolutionary processes acting on the vaginal microbiome may play a vital role in adverse pregnancy outcomes such as preterm birth.",,,

In Cryptococcus neoformans, melanin is synthesized from exogenous substrate and deposited in the cell wall. Although melanin is often cited as a protector against mechanical stress, there is a paucity of direct experimental data supporting this claim. To probe whether melanin enhances cellular strength, we used ultrasonic cavitation and French cell press pressure to stress cryptococcal cells and then measured changes in cellular morphology and fragmentation for melanized and nonmelanized C. neoformans cells. Melanized yeast cells exhibited lower rates of fragmentation and greater cell areas than did nonmelanized yeast cells after sonication or French press passage. When subjected to French press passage, both melanized and nonmelanized cells exhibited responses that were dependent on their culture age. Our results indicate that melanization protects against some of the morphological changes, such as fragmentation and cellular shrinkage, that are initiated by mechanical energy derived from either sonic cavitation or French press passage, thus supporting the notion that this pigment provides mechanical strength for fungal cell walls.

We now report the detection of high-risk mRNA variants exclusively in the circulation of HCC patients. Numerous genomic alleles such as single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), nucleotide insertions and deletions (called Indels), splicing variants in many genes, have been associated with elevated risk of cancer. Our findings potentially offer a novel non-invasive platform for HCC surveillance and early detection. RNAseq analysis was carried out in the plasma of 14 individuals with a diagnosis of HCC, 8 with LC and no HCC, and 6 with no liver disease diagnosis. RNA from 6 matching tumors and 5 circulating extracellular vesicle (EV) samples from 14 of those with HCC was also analyzed. Specimens from two cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) patients were also included in our study. HCC specific SNPs and Indels referred as ""variants"" were identified using GATK HaplotypeCaller and annotated by SnpEff to filter out high risk variants. The variant calling on all RNA samples enabled the detection of 5.2 million SNPs, 0.91 million insertions and 0.81 million deletions. RNAseq analyses in tumors, normal liver tissue, plasma, and plasma derived EVs led to the detection of 5480 high-risk tumor specific mRNA variants in the circulation of HCC patients. These variants are concurrently detected in tumors and plasma samples or tumors and EVs from HCC patients, but none of these were detected in normal liver, plasma of LC patients or normal healthy individuals. Our results demonstrate selective detection of concordant high-risk HCC-specific mRNA variants in free plasma, plasma derived EVs and tumors of HCC patients. The variants comprise of splicing, frameshift, fusion and single nucleotide alterations and correspond to cancer and tumor metabolism pathways. Detection of these high-risk variants in matching specimens from same subjects with an enrichment in circulating EVs is remarkable. Validation of these HCC selective ctmRNA variants in larger patient cohorts is likely to identify a predictive set of ctmRNA with high diagnostic performance and thus offer a novel non-invasive serology-based biomarker for HCC.",Lu J,Ray Biotech Life Inc.,
36560427,Harnessing NK Cells to Control Metastasis.,,Vaccines,10.3390/vaccines10122018,"In recent years, tumor immunotherapy has produced remarkable results in tumor treatment. Nevertheless, its effects are severely limited in patients with low or absent pre-existing T cell immunity. Accordingly, metastasis remains the major cause of tumor-associated death. On the other hand, natural killer (NK) cells have the unique ability to recognize and rapidly act against tumor cells and surveil tumor cell dissemination. The role of NK cells in metastasis prevention is undisputable as an increase in the number of these cells mostly leads to a favorable prognosis. Hence, it is reasonable to consider that successful metastasis involves evasion of NK-cell-mediated immunosurveillance. Therefore, harnessing NK cells to control metastasis is promising. Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) are the seeds for distant metastasis, and the number of CTCs detected in the blood of patients with tumor is associated with a worse prognosis, whereas NK cells can eliminate highly motile CTCs especially in the blood. Here, we review the role of NK cells during metastasis, particularly the specific interactions of NK cells with CTCs, which may provide essential clues on how to harness the power of NK cells against tumor metastasis. As a result, a new way to prevent or treat metastatic tumor may be developed.",,,

But endonuclease (e.g., Cas9) potentially generates undesired edits; thus, there is an urgent need to comprehensively identify off-target sites so that the genotoxicities can be accurately assessed. To date, it is still challenging to streamline the entire process to specifically label and efficiently enrich the cleavage sites from unknown genomic locations. Here we develop PEAC-seq, in which we adopt the Prime Editor to insert a sequence-optimized tag to the editing sites and enrich the tagged regions with site-specific primers for high throughput sequencing. Moreover, we demonstrate that PEAC-seq could identify DNA translocations, which are more genotoxic but usually overlooked by other off-target detection methods. As PEAC-seq does not rely on exogenous oligodeoxynucleotides to label the editing site, we also conduct in vivo off-target identification as proof of concept. In summary, PEAC-seq provides a comprehensive and streamlined strategy to identify CRISPR off-targeting sites in vitro and in vivo, as well as DNA translocation events. This technique further diversified the toolkit to evaluate the genotoxicity of CRISPR applications in research and clinics.",,,malijia@westlake.edu.cn.

Although vaccine development targeting these viruses has been accelerated substantially, there remain patients requiring treatment who cannot be vaccinated or who experience breakthrough infections. Understanding the common host factors necessary for the life cycles of coronaviruses may reveal conserved therapeutic targets. Here, we used the known substrate specificities of mammalian protein kinases to deconvolute the sequence of phosphorylation events mediated by three host protein kinase families (SRPK, GSK-3, and CK1) that coordinately phosphorylate a cluster of serine and threonine residues in the viral N protein, which is required for viral replication. We also showed that loss or inhibition of SRPK1/2, which we propose initiates the N protein phosphorylation cascade, compromised the viral replication cycle. Because these phosphorylation sites are highly conserved across coronaviruses, inhibitors of these protein kinases not only may have therapeutic potential against COVID-19 but also may be broadly useful against coronavirus-mediated diseases.",Levy TM; Van Nest SJ; Schwartz RE; Chen S; Possemato AP; Tkachev SL; Hornbeck PV; Beausoleil SA,Department of Surgery; Department of Physiology and Biophysics; Department of Radiation Oncology; Cell Signaling Technology,

We aimed to evaluate the long-term safety and tolerability of deutetrabenazine for the treatment of Huntington disease. This open-label, single-arm, multi-center study included patients who completed a double-blind study (Rollover) and patients who converted overnight from a stable tetrabenazine dose (Switch). Exposure-adjusted incidence rates (adverse events per person-year) were calculated. Efficacy was analyzed using a stable post-titration timepoint (8 weeks). Changes in the Unified Huntington's Disease Rating Scale total motor score and total maximal chorea score from baseline to week 8, as well as those from week 8 to week 145 (or the last visit on the study drug if that occurred earlier), were evaluated as both efficacy and safety endpoints during the study. Of 119 patients (Rollover, n = 82; Switch, n = 37), 100 (84%) completed ≥ 1 year of treatment. End-of-study exposure-adjusted incidence rates for adverse events in Rollover and Switch, respectively, were: any, 2.57 and 4.02; serious, 0.11 and 0.14; leading to dose suspension, 0.05 and 0.04. Common adverse events (≥ 4% either cohort) included somnolence (Rollover, 20%; Switch, 30%), depression (32%; 22%), anxiety (27%; 35%), insomnia (23%; 16%), and akathisia (6%; 11%). Adverse events of interest included suicidality (9%; 5%) and parkinsonism (4%; 8%). Mean dose at week 8 was 38.1 mg (Rollover) and 36.5 mg (Switch). Mean dose across cohorts after titration was 37.6 mg; at the final visit, mean dose across cohorts was 45.7 mg.

Transdermal rotigotine is indicated for early fluctuations, while subcutaneous apomorphine infusion and levodopa-carbidopa intestinal gel are utilised in advanced PD. All three strategies are considered examples of continuous dopaminergic stimulation achieved through CDD. A central premise of the CDD is to achieve stable control of the parkinsonian motor and non-motor states and avoid emergence of 'OFF' periods. However, data suggest that despite their efficacy in reducing the number and duration of 'OFF' periods, these strategies still do not prevent 'OFF' periods in the middle to late stages of PD, thus contradicting the widely held concepts of continuous drug delivery and continuous dopaminergic stimulation. Why these emergent 'OFF' periods still occur is unknown. In this review, we analyse the potential reasons for their persistence. The contribution of drug- and device-related involvement, and the problems related to site-specific drug delivery are analysed. We propose that changes in dopaminergic and non-dopaminergic mechanisms in the basal ganglia might render these persistent 'OFF' periods unresponsive to dopaminergic therapy delivered via CDD.",,,silvia.rota@kcl.ac.uk.

Heart and circulatory physiology,10.1152/ajpheart.00179.2022,"Dilated cardiomyopathy is the leading cause of death in Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), an inherited degenerative disease of the cardiac and skeletal muscle caused by absence of the protein dystrophin. We showed one hallmark of DMD cardiomyopathy is the dysregulation of cardiac gap junction channel protein connexin-43 (Cx43). Proper Cx43 localization and function at the cardiac intercalated disc (ID) is regulated by post-translational phosphorylation of Cx43-carboxy-terminus residues S325/S328/S330 (pS-Cx43). Concurrently, Cx43 traffics along microtubules (MTs) for targeted delivery to the ID. In DMD hearts, absence of dystrophin results in a hyperdensified and disorganized MT cytoskeleton, yet the link with pS-Cx43 remains unaddressed. To gain insight into the relationship between MTs and pS-Cx43, DMD mice (mdx) and pS-Cx43-deficient (mdxS3A) mice were treated with an inhibitor of MT polymerization, colchicine (Colch). Colch treatment protected mdx, not mdxS3A mice, against Cx43 remodeling, improved MT directionality, and enhanced pS-Cx43/tubulin interaction. Likewise, severe arrhythmias were prevented in isoproterenol-stressed mdx, not mdxS3A mice. Furthermore, MT directionality was improved in pS-Cx43-mimicking mdx (mdxS3E). Mdxutr",,,

This survival has been associated in part with the protective effects of melanin, but a comparison of fungal viability in the presence or absence of melanin following spaceflight has never been tested. In this study, we evaluated the protective effects of melanin by comparing the viability of melanized and non-melanized clones of Cryptococcus neoformans yeasts following a roundtrip to the International Space Station. Yeast colonies were placed inside two MixStix silicone tubes; one stayed on Earth and the other was transported inside for 29 days before returning to Earth. Post-flight analysis based on colony-forming unit numbers shows that melanized yeast viability was 50% higher than non-melanized yeasts, while no difference was observed between the Earth-bound control samples.

In contrast, outcomes from workplace mental health programs, which treat mental health difficulties more directly, remain mostly unknown. To determine whether participation in an employer-sponsored mental health benefit was associated with improvements in depression and anxiety, workplace productivity, and ROI as well as to examine factors associated with clinical improvement. This cohort study included participants in a US workplace mental health program implemented by 66 employers across 40 states from January 1, 2018, to January 1, 2021. Participants were employees who enrolled in the mental health benefit program and had at least moderate anxiety or depression, at least 1 appointment, and at least 2 outcome assessments. A digital platform that screened individuals for common mental health conditions and provided access to self-guided digital content, care navigation, and video and in-person psychotherapy and/or medication management. Primary outcomes were the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 for depression (range, 0-27) score and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item scale (range, 0-21) score. The ROI was calculated by comparing the cost of treatment to salary costs for time out of the workplace due to mental health symptoms, measured with the Sheehan Disability Scale. Data were collected through 6 months of follow-up and analyzed using mixed-effects regression. A total of 1132 participants (520 of 724 who reported gender [71.8%] were female; mean [SD] age, 32.9 [8.8] years) were included. Participants reported improvements from pretreatment to posttreatment in depression (b = -6.34; 95% CI, -6.76 to -5.91; Cohen d = -1.11; 95% CI, -1.18 to -1.03) and anxiety (b = -6.28; 95% CI, -6.77 to -5.91; Cohen d = -1.21; 95% CI, -1.30 to -1.13).

35625739,Exploring the Utility of NK Cells in COVID-19.,,Biomedicines,10.3390/biomedicines10051002,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) can manifest as acute respiratory distress syndrome and is associated with substantial morbidity and mortality. Extensive data now indicate that immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection determine the COVID-19 disease course. A wide range of immunomodulatory agents have been tested for the treatment of COVID-19. Natural killer (NK) cells play an important role in antiviral innate immunity, and anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity and antifibrotic activity are particularly critical for COVID-19 control. Notably, SARS-CoV-2 clearance rate, antibody response, and disease progression in COVID-19 correlate with NK cell status, and NK cell dysfunction is linked with increased SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility. Thus, NK cells function as the key element in the switch from effective to harmful immune responses in COVID-19. However, dysregulation of NK cells has been observed in COVID-19 patients, exhibiting depletion and dysfunction, which correlate with COVID-19 severity; this dysregulation perhaps contributes to disease progression. Given these findings, NK-cell-based therapies with anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity, antifibrotic activity, and strong safety profiles for cancers may encourage the rapid application of functional NK cells as a potential therapeutic strategy to eliminate SARS-CoV-2-infected cells at an early stage, facilitate immune-immune cell interactions, and favor inflammatory processes that prevent and/or reverse over-inflammation and inhibit fibrosis progression, thereby helping in the fight against COVID-19. However, our understanding of the role of NK cells in COVID-19 remains incomplete, and further research on the involvement of NK cells in the pathogenesis of COVID-19 is needed. The rationale of NK-cell-based therapies for COVID-19 has to be based on the timing of therapeutic interventions and disease severity, which may be determined by the balance between beneficial antiviral and potential detrimental pathologic actions. NK cells would be more effective early in SARS-CoV-2 infection and prevent the progression of COVID-19. Immunomodulation by NK cells towards regulatory functions could be useful as an adjunct therapy to prevent the progression of COVID-19.",,,

Recently, there has been much interest in targeted delivery of tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA) for treating thrombotic complications. The work presented here characterizes a fibrin-specific nanogel (FSN) design for targeted delivery of tPA to treat thrombotic complications. Fibrin binding and clot degradation were characterized in vitro, and animal models of thrombosis were used to examine nanogel effects on coagulation parameters. In vitro assays showed tPA-FSNs attach to fibrin in a dose-dependent manner independent of tPA loading. In animal models of thrombosis, including an electrolytic injury to monitor clot properties in real time, and a lipopolysaccharide-induced disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) animal model, tPA-FSNs modulated fibrin/fibrinogen and platelet incorporation into clots and at optimized dosing could recover consumptive coagulopathy in DIC. Distribution of unloaded and tPA-loaded FSNs showed potential clearance of tPA-FSNs after 24 h, although unloaded FSNs may be retained at sites of fibrin deposits. Maximum tolerated dose studies showed tPA-FSNs have minimal toxicity up to 20 times the optimized therapeutic dose. Overall, these studies demonstrate the therapeutic efficacy of targeted fibrinolysis for systemic microthrombi and begin to evaluate key translational parameters for tPA-FSN therapeutics, including optimal tPA-FSN dosage in a DIC rodent model and safety of intravenous tPA-FSN therapeutics.",,,

Here we report that FGF21 directly targets cardiac myocytes by binding β-klotho and FGF receptor (FGFR) 4. In combination with high glucose, FGF21 induces cardiac myocyte growth in width mediated by extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) signaling. While short-term FGF21 elevation can be cardio-protective, we find that in type 2 diabetes (T2D) in mice, where serum FGF21 levels are elevated, FGFR4 activation induces concentric cardiac hypertrophy. As T2D patients are at risk for heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), we propose that induction of concentric hypertrophy by elevated FGF21-FGFR4 signaling may constitute a novel mechanism promoting T2D-associated HFpEF such that FGFR4 blockade might serve as a cardio-protective therapy in T2D. In addition, potential adverse cardiac effects of FGF21 mimetics currently in clinical trials should be investigated.",,,kapiloff@stanford.edu.
35480890,Applications of Alginate-Based Nanomaterials in Enhancing the Therapeutic Effects of Bee Products.,,Frontiers in molecular biosciences,10.3389/fmolb.2022.865833,"Since the ancient times, bee products (i.e., honey, propolis, pollen, bee venom, bee bread, and royal jelly) have been considered as natural remedies with therapeutic effects against a number of diseases. The therapeutic pleiotropy of bee products is due to their diverse composition and chemical properties, which is independent on the bee species. This has encouraged researchers to extensively study the therapeutic potentials of these products, especially honey. On the other hand, amid the unprecedented growth in nanotechnology research and applications, nanomaterials with various characteristics have been utilized to improve the therapeutic efficiency of these products. Towards keeping the bee products as natural and non-toxic therapeutics, the green synthesis of nanocarriers loaded with these products or their extracts has received a special attention. Alginate is a naturally produced biopolymer derived from brown algae, the desirable properties of which include biodegradability, biocompatibility, non-toxicity and non-immunogenicity. This review presents an overview of alginates, including their properties, nanoformulations, and pharmaceutical applications, placing a particular emphasis on their applications for the enhancement of the therapeutic effects of bee products. Despite the paucity of studies on fabrication of alginate-based nanomaterials loaded with bee products or their extracts, recent advances in the area of utilizing alginate-based nanomaterials and other types of materials to enhance the therapeutic potentials of bee products are summarized in this work. As the most widespread and well-studied bee products, honey and propolis have garnered a special interest; combining them with alginate-based nanomaterials has led to promising findings, especially for wound healing and skin tissue engineering. Furthermore, future directions are proposed and discussed to encourage researchers to develop alginate-based stingless bee product nanomedicines, and to help in selecting suitable methods for devising nanoformulations based on multi-criteria decision making models. Also, the commercialization prospects of nanocomposites based on alginates and bee products are discussed. In conclusion, preserving original characteristics of the bee products is a critical challenge in developing nano-carrier systems. Alginate-based nanomaterials are well suited for this task because they can be fabricated without the use of harsh conditions, such as shear force and freeze-drying, which are often used for other nano-carriers. Further, conjunction of alginates with natural polymers such as honey does not only combine the medicinal properties of alginates and honey, but it could also enhance the mechanical properties and cell adhesion capacity of alginates.",Ferji K; Six JL; Uskoković V,TardigradeNano LLC; LCPM,

A survey of 5''-modifications of the 4,5-AGAs and the related 5-O-furanosyl apramycin derivatives is presented. In the neomycin and the apralog series, all modifications were well-tolerated, but other 4,5-AGAs require a hydrogen bonding group at the 5''-position for maintenance of antibacterial activity. The 5''-amino modification resulted in parent-like activity, but reduced selectivity against the human cytosolic decoding A site rendering this modification unfavorable in paromomycin, propylamycin, and ribostamycin. Installation of a 5''-formamido group and, to a lesser degree, a 5''-ureido group resulted in parent-like activity without loss of selectivity.

Whether hyperphosphatemia and/or associated changes in metabolic regulators, including elevations of fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) directly contribute to specific complications of CKD is uncertain. Here, we report that similar to patients with CKD, mice with adenine-induced CKD develop inflammation, anemia, and skeletal muscle wasting. These complications are also observed in mice fed high phosphate diet even without CKD. Ablation of pathologic FGF23-FGFR4 signaling did not protect mice on an increased phosphate diet or mice with adenine-induced CKD from these sequelae. However, low phosphate diet ameliorated anemia and skeletal muscle wasting in a genetic mouse model of CKD. Our mechanistic in vitro studies indicate that phosphate elevations induce inflammatory signaling and increase hepcidin expression in hepatocytes, a potential causative link between hyperphosphatemia, anemia, and skeletal muscle dysfunction. Our study suggests that high phosphate intake, as caused by the consumption of processed food, may have harmful effects irrespective of pre-existing kidney injury, supporting not only the clinical utility of treating hyperphosphatemia in CKD patients but also arguing for limiting phosphate intake in healthy individuals.",,,

Here, we show AKT serine/threonine kinase-dependent epigenetic control of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression by high-cannabidiol (CBD) cannabis extracts and their individual components. CBD alone and extracts #1, #5, #7, and #129 downregulated ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in lung fibroblast WI-38 cells through AKT-mediated inhibition. miR-200c-3p and let-7a-5p were two contributing miRNAs in CBD-mediated suppression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2. CBD and terpene PTWT2.2 profoundly inhibited ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression, both individually and in combination. Extracts #1, #5, #7, and #169 suppressed COX2 expression and remarkably attenuated TNFα/IFNγ-triggered induction of proinflammatory factors IL-6 and IL-8 by AKT pathway. The most abundant molecules present in extracts #1 and #7 modulated the expression of COX2, IL-6, and IL-8 both individually and in combination.

We previously reported that EC-specific genetic deletion of the myristoylated alanine-rich protein kinase C substrate (Marcks) disrupts barrier functions and elevates oxidative stress and lipid droplet accumulation in ECs causing precocious cellular aging. However, little is known regarding the mechanisms that mediate these changes in ECs. To gain insight into Marcks-mediated mechanisms, we performed mass spectrometric analyses on Marcks-associated proteins in young and aged ECs in the mouse forebrain using an integrated approach. Network analysis on annotated proteins revealed that the identified Marcks-associated complexes are in part involved in protein transport mechanisms in young ECs. In fact, we found perturbed intracellular vesicular trafficking in cultured ECs with selective deletion of Marcks (Marcks-cKO mice), or upon pharmacological alteration to phosphorylation status of Marcks. In comparison, Marcks-associated protein complexes in aged ECs appear to be involved in regulation of lipid metabolism and responses to oxidative stress. Confirming this, we found elevated signatures of inflammation in the cerebral cortices and the hippocampi of young Marcks-cKO mice. Interestingly, behavioral testing using a water maze task indicated that spatial learning and memory is diminished in young Marcks-cKO mice similar to aged wildtype mice. Taken together, our study provides first line of evidence for potential mechanisms that may mediate differential Marcks functions in young and old ECs, and their effect on forebrain homeostasis during aging.",O'Toole R; Brudvig JJ; Weimer JM,Pediatrics and Rare Diseases Group,tghashg@ncsu.edu.

Inter- and intratumor heterogeneity in signaling within various tumor compartments and its impact on therapy are not well characterized due to the limited sensitivity of single-cell proteomic approaches. To overcome this barrier, we applied single-cell mass cytometry with a customized 26-antibody panel to PTEN-deleted orthotopic prostate cancer xenograft models to measure the evolution of kinase activities in different tumor compartments during metastasis or drug treatment. Compared with primary tumors and circulating tumor cells (CTC), bone metastases, but not lung and liver metastases, exhibited elevated PI3K/mTOR signaling and overexpressed receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK) including c-MET protein. Suppression of c-MET impaired tumor growth in the bone. Intratumoral heterogeneity within tumor compartments also arose from highly proliferative EpCAM-high epithelial cells with increased PI3K and mTOR kinase activities coexisting with poorly proliferating EpCAM-low mesenchymal populations with reduced kinase activities; these findings were recapitulated in epithelial and mesenchymal CTC populations in patients with metastatic prostate and breast cancer. Increased kinase activity in EpCAM-high cells rendered them more sensitive to PI3K/mTOR inhibition, and drug-resistant EpCAM-low populations with reduced kinase activity emerged over time. Taken together, single-cell proteomics indicate that microenvironment- and cell state-dependent activation of kinase networks create heterogeneity and differential drug sensitivity among and within tumor populations across different sites, defining a new paradigm of drug responses to kinase inhibitors. Single-cell mass cytometry analyses provide insights into the differences in kinase activities across tumor compartments and cell states, which contribute to heterogeneous responses to targeted therapies.",,,

Consensus document of the ESC Working Group on Myocardial Function and the ESC Working Group on Cellular Biology of the Heart.,2022-12-15,Cardiovascular research,10.1093/cvr/cvab370,"Cardiovascular diseases represent a major cause of morbidity and mortality, necessitating research to improve diagnostics, and to discover and test novel preventive and curative therapies, all of which warrant experimental models that recapitulate human disease. The translation of basic science results to clinical practice is a challenging task, in particular for complex conditions such as cardiovascular diseases, which often result from multiple risk factors and comorbidities. This difficulty might lead some individuals to question the value of animal research, citing the translational 'valley of death', which largely reflects the fact that studies in rodents are difficult to translate to humans. This is also influenced by the fact that new, human-derived in vitro models can recapitulate aspects of disease processes. However, it would be a mistake to think that animal models do not represent a vital step in the translational pathway as they do provide important pathophysiological insights into disease mechanisms particularly on an organ and systemic level. While stem cell-derived human models have the potential to become key in testing toxicity and effectiveness of new drugs, we need to be realistic, and carefully validate all new human-like disease models. In this position paper, we highlight recent advances in trying to reduce the number of animals for cardiovascular research ranging from stem cell-derived models to in situ modelling of heart properties, bioinformatic models based on large datasets, and state-of-the-art animal models, which show clinically relevant characteristics observed in patients with a cardiovascular disease.

Composite scores can simplify data analysis when multiple outcomes of interest are present and allows researchers to conduct smaller, more manageable trials. The Hassan scale is a neonatal morbidity composite scale that assigns high scores to infants with multiple morbidities and low scores to infants without or with single morbidities. The objective of this study was to validate the association between scores on the Hassan scale and neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) length of stay STUDY DESIGN:  We conducted a cohort study of all infants born between 22 and 36 There were 760,037 infants included. The median (interquartile range [IQR]) gestational age of delivery was 34 (31, 35) weeks and the median (IQR) birth weight at delivery was 2,000 (1,503, 2,430) g. The median length of stay for infants discharged home was 17 (10-33) days. A Hassan's score was able to be assigned to 699,206 (92%) patients. Neonatal morbidities included in the Hassan scale were more common among infants born earlier in gestation. On adjusted analysis, the Hassan scale was found to be independently associated with neonatal length of stay ( The Hassan scale, more than a binary composite score, is able to differentiate preterm infants with prolonged hospitalizations from those with short hospitalizations. · The Hassan scale is an independent predictor of neonatal length of stay.. · Classification of infants based on number of morbidities correlates with neonatal length of stay.. · The Hassan scale provided better discrimination than binary composite morbidity scores.. · The Hassan scale may be an economic predictor of health-related costs..",,,

Heart and circulatory physiology,10.1152/ajpheart.00197.2021,"Heart failure is the one of the leading causes of death in the United States. Heart failure is a complex syndrome caused by numerous diseases, including severe myocardial infarction (MI). MI occurs after an occlusion of a cardiac artery causing downstream ischemia. MI is followed by cardiac remodeling involving extensive remodeling and fibrosis, which, if the original insult is severe or prolonged, can ultimately progress into heart failure. There is no ""cure"" for heart failure because therapies to regenerate dead tissue are not yet available. Previous studies have shown that in both post-MI and post-ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) models of heart failure, administration of cortical bone stem cell (CBSC) treatment leads to a reduction in scar size and improved cardiac function. Our first study investigated the ability of mouse CBSC-derived exosomes (mCBSC-dEXO) to recapitulate mouse CBSCs (mCBSC) therapeutic effects in a 24-h post-I/R model. This study showed that injection of mCBSCs and mCBSC-dEXOs into the ischemic region of an infarct had a protective effect against I/R injury. mCBSC-dEXOs recapitulated the effects of CBSC treatment post-I/R, indicating exosomes are partly responsible for CBSC's beneficial effects. To examine if exosomes decrease fibrotic activation, adult rat ventricular fibroblasts (ARVFs) and adult human cardiac fibroblasts (NHCFs) were treated with transforming growth factor β (TGFβ) to activate fibrotic signaling before treatment with mCBSC- and human CBSC (hCBSC)-dEXOs. hCBSC-dEXOs caused a 100-fold decrease in human fibroblast activation. To further understand the signaling mechanisms regulating the protective decrease in fibrosis, we performed RNA sequencing on the NHCFs after hCBSC-dEXO treatment. The group treated with both TGFβ and exosomes showed a decrease in small nucleolar RNA (snoRNA), known to be involved with ribosome stability.",,,

34576851,A Small Virus to Deliver Small Antibodies: New Targeted Therapies Based on AAV Delivery of Nanobodies.,,Microorganisms,10.3390/microorganisms9091956,"Nanobodies are camelid-derived single-domain antibodies that present some advantages versus conventional antibodies, such as a smaller size, and higher tissue penetrability, stability, and hydrophilicity. Although nanobodies can be delivered as proteins, in vivo expression from adeno-associated viral (AAV) vectors represents an attractive strategy. This is due to the fact that AAV vectors, that can provide long-term expression of recombinant genes, have shown an excellent safety profile, and can accommodate genes for one or several nanobodies. In fact, several studies showed that AAV vectors can provide sustained nanobody expression both locally or systemically in preclinical models of human diseases. Some of the pathologies addressed with this technology include cancer, neurological, cardiovascular, infectious, and genetic diseases. Depending on the indication, AAV-delivered nanobodies can be expressed extracellularly or inside cells. Intracellular nanobodies or ""intrabodies"" carry out their function by interacting with cell proteins involved in disease and have also been designed to help elucidate cellular mechanisms by interfering with normal cell processes. Finally, nanobodies can also be used to retarget AAV vectors, when tethered to viral capsid proteins.

We show that interferon-γ (IFN-γ) reduced tumor progression in mouse models of B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) and colorectal carcinoma (MC38). Its activity depended on the immune system's capacity to respond to IFN-γ and drove the counter-selection of leukemia cells expressing surrogate antigens.

A large volume of these data has led to the production of equally immense sets of immunological data, which require rigorous computational approaches to sort through and make sense of. Immunoinformatics has emerged in the recent decades as a field capable of offering this approach by bridging experimental and theoretical immunology with state-of-the-art computational tools. Here, we discuss how immunoinformatics can assist in the development of high-performance vaccines and drug discovery needed to curb the spread of SARS-CoV-2. Immunoinformatics can provide a set of computational tools to extract meaningful connections from the large sets of COVID-19 patient data, which can be implemented in the design of effective vaccines. With this in mind, we represent a pipeline to identify the role of immunoinformatics in COVID-19 treatment and vaccine development.

Propylamycin nevertheless is inactivated by APH(3')-Ia, a specific aminoglycoside phosphotransferase isozyme that acts on the primary hydroxy group of the ribofuranosyl moiety (at the 5''-position). To overcome this problem, we have prepared and studied the antibacterial and antiribosomal activity of various propylamycin derivatives carrying amino or substituted amino groups at the 5''-position in place of the vulnerable hydroxy group. We find that the introduction of an additional basic amino group at this position, while overcoming the action of the aminoglycoside phosphoryltransferase isozymes acting at the 5''-position as anticipated, results in a significant drop in selectivity for the bacterial over the eukaryotic ribosomes that is predictive of increased ototoxicity. In contrast, 5''-deoxy-5''-formamidopropylamycin retains the excellent across-the-board levels of antibacterial activity of propylamycin itself, while circumventing the action of the offending aminoglycoside phosphotransferase isozymes and affording even greater selectivity for the bacterial over the eukaryotic ribosomes.

We highlight potential drawbacks associated with the use of specific prodrugs, such as systemic toxicity of the activated compound, the paucity of data on biodistribution of prodrugs, bystander effects, and destruction of genetically modified cells, and how these can inform future advances in cell therapies.",,,semira.sheikh@uhn.ca.

This study evaluated the action mechanism of Lactobacillus plantarum L-14 (KTCT13497BP) extract and the effects of its periodic oral intake in a high-fat-diet (HFD) mouse model. Mouse pre-adipocyte 3T3-L1 cells and human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (hBM-MSC) were treated with L-14 extract every 2 days during adipogenic differentiation, and the mechanism underlying anti-adipogenic effects was analysed at cellular and molecular levels. L-14 extract was orally administrated to HFD-feeding C57BL/6J mice every 2 days for 7 weeks. White adipose tissue was collected and weighed, and liver and blood serum were analysed. The anti-adipogenic mechanism of exopolysaccharide (EPS) isolated from L-14 extract was also analysed using Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) inhibitor C29. L-14 extract inhibited 3T3-L1 and hBM-MSC differentiation into mature adipocytes by upregulating AMPK signalling pathway in the early stage of adipogenic differentiation. The weight of the HFD + L-14 group (31.51 ± 1.96 g) was significantly different from that of the HFD group (35.14 ± 3.18 g). L-14 extract also significantly decreased the serum triacylglycerol/high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio (an insulin resistance marker) and steatohepatitis. In addition, EPS activated the AMPK signalling pathway by interacting with TLR2, consequently inhibiting adipogenesis. EPS from L-14 extract inhibits adipogenesis via TLR2 and AMPK signalling pathways, and oral intake of L-14 extract improves obesity and obesity-associated diseases in vivo. Therefore, EPS can be used to prevent and treat obesity and metabolic disorders.",,,

RNA therapeutics comprise a rapidly expanding category of drugs that will change the standard of care for many diseases and actualize personalized medicine. These drugs are cost effective, relatively simple to manufacture, and can target previously undruggable pathways. It is a disruptive therapeutic technology, as small biotech startups, as well as academic groups, can rapidly develop new and personalized RNA constructs. In this review we discuss general concepts of different classes of RNA-based therapeutics, including antisense oligonucleotides, aptamers, small interfering RNAs, microRNAs, and messenger RNA. Furthermore, we provide an overview of the RNA-based therapies that are currently being evaluated in clinical trials or have already received regulatory approval. The challenges and advantages associated with use of RNA-based drugs are also discussed along with various approaches for RNA delivery. In addition, we introduce a new concept of hospital-based RNA therapeutics and share our experience with establishing such a platform at Houston Methodist Hospital.",,,

Here we present a systematic study of technology licensing by one such institution, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). Using data on the 76 therapeutics-focused life sciences companies formed through MIT's Technology Licensing Office from 1983 to 2017, we construct several measures of impact, including MIT patents cited in the Orange Book, capital raised, outcomes from mergers and acquisitions, patents granted to MIT intellectual property licensees, drug candidates discovered and US drug approvals-a key benchmark of innovation in the biopharmaceutical industry. As of December 2017, Orange Book listings for four approved small-molecule drugs cite MIT patents, but another 31 FDA-approved drugs (excluding candidates acquired after phase 3) had some involvement of MIT licensees. Fifty-five percent of the latter were either a new molecular entity or a new biological entity, and 55% were granted priority review, an indication that they address an unmet medical need.

Intriguingly, distinct mutations arise in discrete anatomical regions: H3.3-G34R within the forebrain and H3.3-K27M preferentially within the hindbrain. The reasons for this contrasting etiology are unknown. By engineering human fetal neural stem cell cultures from distinct brain regions, we demonstrate here that cell-intrinsic regional identity provides differential responsiveness to each mutant that mirrors the origins of pHGGs. Focusing on H3.3-G34R, we find that the oncohistone supports proliferation of forebrain cells while inducing a cytostatic response in the hindbrain. Mechanistically, H3.3-G34R does not impose widespread transcriptional or epigenetic changes but instead impairs recruitment of ZMYND11, a transcriptional repressor of highly expressed genes. We therefore propose that H3.3-G34R promotes tumorigenesis by focally stabilizing the expression of key progenitor genes, thereby locking initiating forebrain cells into their pre-existing immature state.",,,steven.pollard@ed.ac.uk.

Expression of pathogenic expanded CUG repeat (CUGexp) RNA causes multisystemic disease by perturbing the functions of RNA-binding proteins, resulting in expression of fetal protein isoforms in adult tissues. Cardiac involvement affects 50% of individuals with DM1 and causes 25% of disease-related deaths. We developed a transgenic mouse model for tetracycline-inducible and heart-specific expression of human DMPK mRNA containing 960 CUG repeats. CUGexp RNA is expressed in atria and ventricles and induced mice exhibit electrophysiological and molecular features of DM1 disease, including cardiac conduction delays, supraventricular arrhythmias, nuclear RNA foci with Muscleblind protein colocalization, and alternative splicing defects. Importantly, these phenotypes were rescued upon loss of CUGexp RNA expression. Transcriptome analysis revealed gene expression and alternative splicing changes in ion transport genes that are associated with inherited cardiac conduction diseases, including a subset of genes involved in calcium handling. Consistent with RNA-Seq results, calcium-handling defects were identified in atrial cardiomyocytes isolated from mice expressing CUGexp RNA. These results identify potential tissue-specific mechanisms contributing to cardiac pathogenesis in DM1 and demonstrate the utility of reversible phenotypes in our model to facilitate development of targeted therapeutic approaches.",Rao AN; Campbell HM; Word TA; Wehrens XH; Cooper TA,Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology.; Department of Molecular Physiology and Biophysics,
33406107,Prediction of neonatal morbidity and very preterm delivery using maternal steroid biomarkers in early gestation.,2021-04-20,PloS one,10.1371/journal.pone.0243585,"Preterm delivery is a common pregnancy complication that can result in significant neonatal morbidity and mortality. Limited tools exist to predict preterm birth, and none to predict neonatal morbidity, from early in pregnancy. The objective of this study was to determine if the progesterone metabolites 11-deoxycorticosterone (DOC) and 16-alpha hydroxyprogesterone (16α-OHP), when combined with patient demographic and obstetric history known during the pregnancy, are predictive of preterm delivery-associated neonatal morbidity, neonatal length of stay, and risk for spontaneous preterm delivery prior to 32 weeks' gestation. We conducted a cohort study of pregnant women with plasma samples collected as part of Building Blocks of Pregnancy Biobank at the Indiana University School of Medicine. The progesterone metabolites, DOC and 16α-OHP, were quantified by mass spectroscopy from the plasma of 58 pregnant women collected in the late first trimester/early second trimester. Steroid levels were combined with patient demographic and obstetric history data in multivariable logistic regression models. The primary outcome was composite neonatal morbidity as measured by the Hassan scale. Secondary outcomes included neonatal length of stay and spontaneous preterm delivery prior to 32 weeks' gestation. The final neonatal morbidity model, which incorporated antenatal corticosteroid exposure and fetal sex, was able to predict high morbidity (Hassan score ≥ 2) with an area under the ROC curve (AUROC) of 0.975 (95% CI 0.932, 1.00), while the model without corticosteroid and fetal sex predictors demonstrated an AUROC of 0.927 (95% CI 0.824, 1.00). The Hassan score was highly correlated with neonatal length of stay (p<0.001), allowing the neonatal morbidity model to also predict increased neonatal length of stay (53 [IQR 22, 76] days vs. 4.5 [2, 31] days, above and below the model cut point, respectively; p = 0.0017). Spontaneous preterm delivery prior to 32 weeks' gestation was also predicted with an AUROC of 0.94 (95% CI 0.869, 1.00). Plasma levels of DOC and 16α-OHP in early gestation can be combined with patient demographic and clinical data to predict significant neonatal morbidity, neonatal length of stay, and risk for very preterm delivery, though validation studies are needed to verify these findings. Early identification of pregnancies at risk for preterm delivery and neonatal morbidity allows for timely implementation of multidisciplinary care to improve perinatal outcomes.",,,

However, current FA methods used by biotechnology and pharmaceutical (biotech-pharma) trial sponsors and contract research organizations (CROs) are costly, inefficient, unnecessarily burdensome, and resource intensive. These methods delay trial start-up, act as a barrier to site participation, and ultimately reduce timely patient access to clinical trials and novel treatments. An ASCO Task Force was convened to assess the specific burdens and challenges with FAs and to develop recommendations to improve their efficiencies and effectiveness. Stakeholders (including trial sites, biotech-pharma sponsors, and CROs) provided insights into challenges and offered solutions through two surveys and an in-person meeting. The Task Force used the feedback to formulate consensus recommendations to improve FAs for oncology clinical trials. Three key recommendations were identified for application across all biotech-pharma sponsored trials: (1) implement a streamlined and uniform FA process across trials and sponsors; (2) minimize and standardize questions; and (3) leverage technology to centralize FAs, facilitate communications, and reduce redundancies. There is an urgency to improve the current FA process, which is costly, inconsistent, inefficient, labor intensive, and of uncertain effectiveness.

Part A,10.1002/ajmg.a.62037,"Long QT syndrome (LQTS) is a genetic disease resulting in a prolonged QT interval on a resting electrocardiogram, predisposing affected individuals to polymorphic ventricular tachycardia and sudden death. Although a number of genes have been implicated in this disease, nearly one in four individuals exhibiting the LQTS phenotype are genotype-negative. Whole-exome sequencing identified a missense T223M variant in TBX5 that cosegregates with prolonged QT interval in a family with otherwise genotype-negative LQTS and sudden death. The TBX5-T223M variant was absent among large ostensibly healthy populations (gnomAD) and predicted to be pathogenic by in silico modeling based on Panther, PolyPhen-2, Provean, SIFT, SNAP2, and PredictSNP prediction tools. The variant was located in a highly conserved region of TBX5 predicted to be part of the DNA-binding interface. A luciferase assay identified a 57.5% reduction in the ability of TBX5-T223M to drive expression at the atrial natriuretic factor promotor compared to wildtype TBX5 in vitro. We conclude that the variant is pathogenic in this family, and we put TBX5 forward as a disease susceptibility allele for genotype-negative LQTS. The identification of this familial variant may serve as a basis for the identification of previously unknown mechanisms of LQTS with broader implications for cardiac electrophysiology.",,,

Unfortunately, toxicities associated with systemic administration of these agonists have limited their clinical use to date. Direct injection of PRR agonists into the tumour can enhance immune responses by directly modulating the cells present in the tumour microenvironment. This can improve local antitumour activity, but importantly, also facilitates systemic responses that limit tumour growth at distant sites. As such, this form of therapy could be used clinically where metastatic tumour lesions are accessible, or as neoadjuvant therapy. In this review, we summarise current preclinical data on intratumoural administration of PRR agonists, including new strategies to optimise delivery and impact, and combination studies with current and promising new cancer therapies.",,,

Here, we identified a mechanism of bacterial adaptation to the host niche, where they reside. Asymptomatic carrier strains were shown to inhibit RNA polymerase II (Pol II) in host cells by targeting Ser2 phosphorylation, a step required for productive mRNA elongation. Assisted by a rare, spontaneous loss-of-function mutant from a human carrier, the bacterial NlpD protein was identified as a Pol II inhibitor. After internalization by host cells, NlpD was shown to target constituents of the Pol II phosphorylation complex (RPB1 and PAF1C), attenuating host gene expression. Therapeutic efficacy of a recombinant NlpD protein was demonstrated in a urinary tract infection model, by reduced tissue pathology, accelerated bacterial clearance, and attenuated Pol II-dependent gene expression.

PDA-silica hybrids incorporated different molecular interactions to a single system, enhancing cfDNA capture by 1.34-fold compared to the conventional silica-based approach (p = 0.001), which was confirmed using cell culture supernatants. A clinical study using human plasma samples revealed that the diagnostic accuracy of the new system to be superior than the commercially available cfDNA kit, as well as other serum antigen tests.

Model-informed drug development may facilitate its transition from preclinical to clinical phase. This study explored the potential of pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) modeling to maximize the use of in vitro time-kill and in vivo preclinical data for prediction of a human efficacious dose (HED) for apramycin. PK model parameters of apramycin from four different species (mouse, rat, guinea pig, and dog) were allometrically scaled to humans. A semimechanistic PK/PD model was developed from the rich in vitro data on four Escherichia coli strains and subsequently the sparse in vivo efficacy data on the same strains were integrated. An efficacious human dose was predicted from the PK/PD model and compared with the classical PK/PD index methodology and the aminoglycoside dose similarity. One-compartment models described the PK data and human values for clearance and volume of distribution were predicted to 7.07 L/hour and 26.8 L, respectively. The required fAUC/MIC (area under the unbound drug concentration-time curve over MIC ratio) targets for stasis and 1-log kill in the thigh model were 34.5 and 76.2, respectively. The developed PK/PD model predicted the efficacy data well with strain-specific differences in susceptibility, maximum bacterial load, and resistance development. All three dose prediction approaches supported an apramycin daily dose of 30 mg/kg for a typical adult patient. The results indicate that the mechanistic PK/PD modeling approach can be suitable for HED prediction and serves to efficiently integrate all available efficacy data with potential to improve predictive capacity.",,,

Hereby we report Keggin-type (Mo-V-P) heteropolyacids (HPAs)-catalyzed HTL of microalgae for efficient low-nitrogen biocrude production. The increases of reaction temperature, reaction time, and vanadium substitution degrees of HPAs are favorable to biocrude yield initially, whereas a significant decrease of biocrude yield is observed owing to the enhanced oxidation of carbohydrates above the optimum reaction conditions. The maximum biocrude yield of HPAs-catalyzed HTL of microalgae is 29.95 % at reaction temperature of 300 °C, reaction time of 2 h, and 5 wt% of HPA-4, which is about 19.66 % higher than that of control with 71.17 % less N-containing compounds, including 1,3-propanediamine, 1-pentanamine, and 2, 2'-heptamethylene-di-2-imidazoline than that of control. This work reveals that HPAs with Brønsted acidity and reversible redox properties are capable of both enhancing biocrude production via catalyzing the hydrolysis of cellular compounds and reducing their nitrogen content through avoiding the Maillard reactions between the intermediates of hydrolysis of carbohydrates and proteins.

Patients with HF exhibit a loss of junctophilin-2 (JPH2), a structural protein critical in forming junctional membrane complexes in which excitation-contraction takes place. Several mechanisms have been proposed to mediate the loss of JPH2, one being cleavage by the calcium-dependent protease calpain. The downstream mechanisms underlying HF progression after JPH2 cleavage are presently poorly understood. In this study, we used Labcas to bioinformatically predict putative calpain cleavage sites on JPH2. We identified a cleavage site that produces a novel C-terminal JPH2 peptide (JPH2-CTP) using several domain-specific antibodies. Western blotting revealed elevated JPH2-CTP levels in hearts of patients and mice with HF, corresponding to increased levels of calpain-2. Moreover, immunocytochemistry demonstrated nuclear localization of JPH2-CTP within ventricular myocytes isolated from a murine model of pressure overload-induced HF as well as rat ventricular myocytes treated with isoproterenol. Nuclear localization of JPH2-CTP and cellular remodeling were abrogated by a genetic mutation of the nuclear localization sequence within JPH2-CTP. Taken together, our studies identified a novel C-terminal fragment of JPH2 (JPH2-CTP) generated by calpain-2 mediated cleavage which localizes within the cardiomyocyte nucleus during HF. Blocking nuclear localization of JPH2-CTP protects cardiomyocytes from isoproterenol-induced hypertrophy in vitro. Future in vivo studies of the nuclear role of JPH2-CTP may reveal a causal association with adverse remodeling during HF and establish CTP as a therapeutic target.",Samson-Couterie B; Elzenaar I; van Oort RJ,Department of Experimental Cardiology,wehrens@bcm.edu.

Here, we report that p38γ MAPK, which promotes PDAC tumorigenesis by linking KRAS signaling and aerobic glycolysis (also called the Warburg effect), is a novel therapeutic target. p38γ interacted with a glycolytic activator PFKFB3 that was dependent on mutated KRAS. KRAS transformation and overexpression of p38γ increased expression of PFKFB3 and glucose transporter GLUT2, conversely, silencing mutant KRAS, and p38γ decreased PFKFB3 and GLUT2 expression. p38γ phosphorylated PFKFB3 at S467, stabilized PFKFB3, and promoted their interaction with GLUT2. Pancreatic knockout of p38γ decreased p-PFKFB3/PFKFB3/GLUT2 protein levels, reduced aerobic glycolysis, and inhibited PDAC tumorigenesis in KPC mice. PFKFB3 and GLUT2 depended on p38γ to stimulate glycolysis and PDAC growth and p38γ required PFKFB3/S467 to promote these activities. A p38γ inhibitor cooperated with a PFKFB3 inhibitor to blunt aerobic glycolysis and PDAC growth, which was dependent on p38γ. Moreover, overexpression of p38γ, p-PFKFB3, PFKFB3, and GLUT2 in PDAC predicted poor clinical prognosis. These results indicate that p38γ links KRAS oncogene signaling and aerobic glycolysis to promote pancreatic tumorigenesis through PFKFB3 and GLUT2, and that p38γ and PFKFB3 may be targeted for therapeutic intervention in PDAC. SIGNIFICANCE: These findings show that p38γ links KRAS oncogene signaling and the Warburg effect through PFKBF3 and Glut2 to promote pancreatic tumorigenesis, which can be disrupted via inhibition of p38γ and PFKFB3.",Bartrons Bach R,Department de Ciencies Fisiologiques,gchen@mcw.edu

However, clinically significant capture of renal cell carcinoma CTCs (RCC-CTCs) remains elusive due to their heterogenous surface receptor expression. Herein, a novel capture platform is developed to detect RCC-CTCs through integration of dendrimer-mediated multivalent binding, a mixture of antibodies, and biomimetic cell rolling. The nanoscale binding kinetics measured using atomic force microscopy reveal that dendrimer-coated surfaces exhibit an order of magnitude enhancement in off-rate kinetics compared to surface without dendrimers, which translated into cell capture improvements by ~60%. Selectin-induced cell rolling facilitates surface recruitment of cancer cells, further improving cancer cell capture by up to 1.7-fold. Lastly, an antibody cocktail targeting four RCC-CTC surface receptors, which included epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM), carbonic anhydrase IX (CA9), epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), and hepatocyte growth factor receptor (c-Met), improves the capture of RCC cells by up to 80%.

Although many groups have attempted to develop peptides with high cell-penetrating efficiencies, very few have demonstrated efficient cellular uptake of CPPs at low concentrations. Here, we describe a newly synthesized peptide derived from Arabidopsis, Ara-27, which exhibits significant improvement in cell-penetrating efficiency compared to existing CPPs. The cell-penetrating efficiency of Ara-27 was compared with the commonly used Tat-protein transduction domain (Tat-PTD) and membrane translocating sequence (MTS) in human dermal fibroblast (HDF) and human dental pulp stem cells (hDPSC). Cell-penetrating efficiency of fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-labeled CPPs were assessed by flow cytometry and visualized by confocal microscopy. Flow cytometric analysis revealed >99% cell-penetrating efficiency for 2 μM Ara-27 in both HDF and hDPSC. In contrast, 2 μM Tat-PTD and MTS showed <10% cell-penetrating efficiency in both cells. In support, relative fluorescence intensities of FITC-labeled Ara-27 were around 8 to 22 times higher than those of Tat-PTD and MTS in both cells. Confocal analysis revealed internalization of 0.2 and 2 μM Ara-27 in both human cells, which was not observed for Tat-PTD and MTS at either concentration. In conclusion, this study describes a novel CPP, Ara-27, which exhibit significant improvement in intracellular uptake compared to conventional CPPs, without affecting cell viability.

Maternal serum levels of 11-deoxycorticosterone (DOC) measured during the late first trimester or early second trimester correlate with an increased risk for preterm delivery prior to 32 weeks, and the correlation becomes stronger when the ratio of DOC to 16-alpha-hydroxyprogesterone was measured. Progesterone is a pro-gestational steroid hormone that has been shown to decrease the risk of preterm birth in some pregnant women. Progesterone is metabolized by the body into various metabolites including members of the mineralocorticoid and glucocorticoid families. Our group has previously demonstrated that some progesterone metabolites enhance myometrial contractility in an  The Building Blocks of Pregnancy Biobank (BBPB) is a biorepository at Indiana University (IU) that follows women prospectively through their pregnancy. A variety of biospecimens are collected at various time points during a woman's pregnancy.

Women delivering prior to 37 weeks (preterm) and at or after 37 weeks (term) who had blood samples collected during the late first trimester/early second trimester and/or during the early third trimester were identified. These samples were then processed for mass spectroscopy, and the amount of progesterone and progesterone metabolites in the samples were measured. Mean values of each measured steroid metabolite were calculated and compared among women delivering at less than 32 weeks, less than 37 weeks and greater than or equal to 37 weeks. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were constructed and threshold levels determined for each compound to identify a level above or below which best predicted a woman's risk for delivery prior to 32 and prior to 37 weeks. Mann-Whitney  Steroid hormone levels and pregnancy outcome data were available for 93 women; 28 delivering prior to 32 weeks, 40 delivering between 32 0/7 and 36 6/7 weeks and 25 delivering at or greater than 37 weeks: the mean gestational age at delivery within the three groups was 27.0, 34.4 and 38.8 weeks, respectively. Among women delivering spontaneously at less than 37 weeks, maternal 11-deoxycorticosterone (DOC) levels drawn in the late first trimester/early second trimester were significantly associated with spontaneous preterm delivery prior to 32 weeks; a threshold level of 47.5 pg/ml had 78% sensitivity, 73% specificity and an AUC of 0.77 ( This is a discovery study, and the findings have not been validated on an independent cohort. To mitigate issues with multiple comparisons, we limited our study to pre-specified metabolites that are most representative of the major metabolic pathways for progesterone, and adjustments for multiple comparisons were made. Spontaneous preterm birth is increasingly being recognized to represent a common end pathway for a number of different disease phenotypes that include infection, inflammation, premature rupture of the membranes, uterine over distension, cervical insufficiency, placental dysfunction and genetic predisposition. In addition to these phenotypes, longitudinal changes in the maternal-fetal hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis also likely contribute to a significant proportion of the disease burden of spontaneous preterm birth. Here, we demonstrate that differential production of steroid metabolites is associated with very early preterm birth. The identified biomarkers may hint at a pathophysiologic mechanism and changes in the maternal-fetal dyad that result in preterm delivery. The early identification of abnormal changes in HPA axis metabolites may allow for targeted interventions that reverse the aberrant steroid metabolic profile to a more favorable one, thereby decreasing the risk for early delivery.

In some HIV-1-infected individuals, bnAbs evolved from precursor antibodies through affinity maturation. To induce bnAbs, a vaccine must mediate a similar antibody maturation process. One way to test a vaccine is to immunize mouse models that express human bnAb precursors and assess whether the vaccine can convert precursor antibodies into bnAbs. A major problem with such mouse models is that bnAb expression often hinders B cell development. Such developmental blocks may be attributed to the unusual properties of bnAb variable regions, such as poly-reactivity and long antigen-binding loops, which are usually under negative selection during primary B cell development. To address this problem, we devised a method to circumvent such B cell developmental blocks by expressing bnAbs conditionally in mature B cells. We validated this method by expressing the unmutated common ancestor (UCA) of the human VRC26 bnAb in transgenic mice. Constitutive expression of the VRC26UCA led to developmental arrest of B cell progenitors in bone marrow; poly-reactivity of the VRC26UCA and poor pairing of the VRC26UCA heavy chain with the mouse surrogate light chain may contribute to this phenotype. The conditional expression strategy bypassed the impediment to VRC26UCA B cell development, enabling the expression of VRC26UCA in mature B cells. This approach should be generally applicable for expressing other bnAbs that are under negative selection during B cell development.",,,ming.tian@childrens.harvard.edu

In vitro and in vivo studies have shown polyphenols and other natural compounds to be anti-adipogenic, presumably due in part to their antioxidant properties. Purpurin is a highly antioxidative anthraquinone and previous studies on anthraquinones have reported numerous biological activities in cells and animals. Anthraquinones have also been used to stimulate osteoblast differentiation, an inversely-related process to that of adipocyte differentiation. We propose that due to its high antioxidative properties, purpurin administration might attenuate adipogenesis in cells and in mice. Our study will test the effect purpurin has on adipogenesis using both in vitro and in vivo models. The in vitro model consists of tracking with various biomarkers, the differentiation of pre-adipocyte to adipocytes in cell culture. The compound will then be tested in mice fed a high-fat diet. Murine 3T3-L1 preadipocyte cells were stimulated to differentiate in the presence or absence of purpurin. The following cellular parameters were measured: intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), membrane potential of the mitochondria, ATP production, activation of AMPK (adenosine 5'-monophosphate-activated protein kinase), insulin-induced lipid accumulation, triglyceride accumulation, and expression of PPARγ (peroxisome proliferator activated receptor-γ) and C/EBPα (CCAAT enhancer binding protein α). In vivo, mice were fed high fat diets supplemented with various levels of purpurin. Data collected from the animals included anthropometric data, glucose tolerance test results, and postmortem plasma glucose, lipid levels, and organ examinations. The administration of purpurin at 50 and 100 μM in 3T3-L1 cells, and at 40 and 80 mg/kg in mice proved to be a sensitive range: the lower concentrations affected several measured parameters, whereas at the higher doses purpurin consistently mitigated biomarkers associated with adipogenesis, and weight gain in mice. Purpurin appears to be an effective antiadipogenic compound. The anthraquinone purpurin has potent in vitro anti-adipogenic effects in cells and in vivo anti-obesity effects in mice consuming a high-fat diet. Differentiation of 3T3-L1 cells was dose-dependently inhibited by purpurin, apparently by AMPK activation.

Although individuals mainly support data sharing for research purposes, the for-profit nature of such data sharing raises some questions regarding the rights of the data subjects and fairness in sharing benefits. In response, a new generation of sequencing and data sharing startups such as Nebula Genomics, LunaDNA, and EncrypGen are emerging which aim for leaving the data control in the hands of each individual customer. In particular, such so-called ""DNA data marketplaces"" allow individuals to receive various types of monetary incentives to sequence their genome and share it with interested commercial parties. This paper aims to provide an exploratory and critical review of the ethical challenges related to establishing such marketplaces for genomic and health data sharing. In the view of the growing number of startups developing such marketplaces, a thorough analysis of the relevant ethical concerns is timely and needed.",,,
31712314,Successes and challenges in simulating the folding of large proteins.,2020-09-08,The Journal of biological chemistry,10.1074/jbc.REV119.006794,"Computational simulations of protein folding can be used to interpret experimental folding results, to design new folding experiments, and to test the effects of mutations and small molecules on folding. However, whereas major experimental and computational progress has been made in understanding how small proteins fold, research on larger, multidomain proteins, which comprise the majority of proteins, is less advanced. Specifically, large proteins often fold via long-lived partially folded intermediates, whose structures, potentially toxic oligomerization, and interactions with cellular chaperones remain poorly understood. Molecular dynamics based folding simulations that rely on knowledge of the native structure can provide critical, detailed information on folding free energy landscapes, intermediates, and pathways. Further, increases in computational power and methodological advances have made folding simulations of large proteins practical and valuable. Here, using serpins that inhibit proteases as an example, we review native-centric methods for simulating the folding of large proteins. These synergistic approaches range from Gō and related structure-based models that can predict the effects of the native structure on folding to all-atom-based methods that include side-chain chemistry and can predict how disease-associated mutations may impact folding. The application of these computational approaches to serpins and other large proteins highlights the successes and limitations of current computational methods and underscores how computational results can be used to inform experiments. These powerful simulation approaches in combination with experiments can provide unique insights into how large proteins fold and misfold, expanding our ability to predict and manipulate protein folding.",,,gershenson@biochem.umass.edu.

Heart and circulatory physiology,10.1152/ajpheart.00144.2019,"Ischemic heart diseases such as myocardial infarction (MI) are the largest contributors to cardiovascular disease worldwide. The resulting cardiac cell death impairs function of the heart and can lead to heart failure and death. Reperfusion of the ischemic tissue is necessary but causes damage to the surrounding tissue by reperfusion injury. Cortical bone stem cells (CBSCs) have been shown to increase pump function and decrease scar size in a large animal swine model of MI. To investigate the potential mechanism for these changes, we hypothesized that CBSCs were altering cardiac cell death after reperfusion. To test this, we performed TUNEL staining for apoptosis and antibody-based immunohistochemistry on tissue from Göttingen miniswine that underwent 90 min of lateral anterior descending coronary artery ischemia followed by 3 or 7 days of reperfusion to assess changes in cardiomyocyte and noncardiomyocyte cell death. Our findings indicate that although myocyte apoptosis is present 3 days after ischemia and is lower in CBSC-treated animals, myocyte apoptosis accounts for <2% of all apoptosis in the reperfused heart. In addition, nonmyocyte apoptosis trends toward decreased in CBSC-treated hearts, and although CBSCs increase macrophage and T-cell populations in the infarct region, the occurrence of apoptosis in CD45",,,

The presence of five suitably positioned residual basic amino groups was found to be necessary for activity to be retained upon removal or alkylation of the 2'-position amine. As alkylation of the 2'-amino group overcomes the action of resistance determinants acting at that position and in addition results in increased selectivity for the prokaryotic over eukaryotic ribosomes, it constitutes an attractive modification for introduction into next generation aminoglycosides. In the neomycin series, the installation of small (formamide) or basic (glycinamide) amido groups on the 2'-amino group is tolerated.",,,

Because oxidative mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) damage has been linked to endothelial barrier disruption in other models of IR injury, here we used a fusion protein construct targeting the DNA repair 8-oxoguanine DNA glycosylase-1 (OGG1) to mitochondria (mtOGG1) to determine if enhanced repair of mtDNA damage attenuates endothelial barrier dysfunction after IR injury in a rat model of lung procurement after DCD. Lungs excised from donor rats 1 h after cardiac death were cold stored for 2 h after which they were perfused ex vivo in the absence and presence of mt-OGG1 or an inactive mt-OGG1 mutant. Lung endothelial barrier function and mtDNA integrity were determined during and at the end of perfusion, respectively. Mitochondria-targeted OGG1 attenuated indices of lung endothelial dysfunction incurred after a 1h post-mortem period. Oxidative lung tissue mtDNA damage as well as accumulation of proinflammatory mtDNA fragments in lung perfusate, but not nuclear DNA fragments, also were reduced by mitochondria-targeted OGG1. A repair-deficient mt-OGG1 mutant failed to protect lungs from the adverse effects of DCD procurement. These findings suggest that endothelial barrier dysfunction in lungs procured after DCD is driven by mtDNA damage and point to strategies to enhance mtDNA repair in concert with EVLP as a means of alleviating DCD-related lung IR injury.",Wilson GL,Exscien Corporation,mgillesp@southalabama.edu.

To study how supercoiling drives DNA biology, we developed and patented methods to make milligram quantities of tiny supercoiled circles of DNA called minicircles. We used a collaborative and multidisciplinary approach, including computational simulations (both atomistic and coarse-grained), biochemical experimentation, and biophysical methods to study these minicircles. By determining the three-dimensional conformations of individual supercoiled DNA minicircles, we revealed the structural diversity of supercoiled DNA and its highly dynamic nature. We uncovered profound structural changes, including sequence-specific base-flipping (where the DNA base flips out into the solvent), bending, and denaturing in negatively supercoiled minicircles. Counterintuitively, exposed DNA bases emerged in the positively supercoiled minicircles, which may result from inside-out DNA (Pauling-like, or ""P-DNA""). These structural changes strongly influence how enzymes interact with or act on DNA. We hypothesized that, because of their small size and lack of bacterial sequences, these small supercoiled DNA circles may be efficient at delivering DNA into cells for gene therapy applications. ""Minivectors,"" as we named them for this application, have proven to have therapeutic potential. We discovered that minivectors efficiently transfect a wide range of cell types, including many clinically important cell lines that are refractory to transfection with conventional plasmid vectors. Minivectors can be aerosolized for delivery to lungs and transfect human cells in culture to express RNA or genes. Importantly, minivectors demonstrate no obvious vector-associated toxicity. Minivectors can be repeatedly delivered and are long-lasting without integrating into the genome. Requests from colleagues around the world for minicircle and minivector DNA revealed a demand for our invention. We successfully obtained start-up funding for Twister Biotech, Inc. to help fulfill this demand, providing DNA for those who needed it, with a long-term goal of developing human therapeutics. In summary, what started as a tool for studying DNA structure has taken us in new and unanticipated directions.",,,

Drawing extensively on materials from the Roche company archives, the paper traces interferon's trajectory from observed phenomenon (viral interference) to product (Roferon A). Roche embraced molecular biology in the late 1960s to prepare for the moment when the patents on some of its bestselling drugs were going to expire. The company funded two basic science institutes to gain direct access to talents and scientific leads. These investments, I argue, were crucial for Roche's success with recombinant interferon, along with more mundane, technical and regulatory know-how held at Roche's Nutley base. The paper analyses in some detail the development process following the initial success of cloning the interferon gene in collaboration with Genentech. It looks at the factors necessary to scale up the production sufficiently for clinical trials. Using Alfred Chandler's concept of 'organizational capabilities', I argue that the process is better described as 'mobilisation' than as 'translation'.",,,carsten.timmermann@manchester.ac.uk.

No CRISPR-Cas9 mediated off-target effects are detected. Adoptive transfer of human immunocytes from dual treated, virus-free animals to uninfected humanized mice fails to produce infectious progeny virus.

Previously, missense variants in JPH2 have been linked to hypertrophic cardiomyopathy; however, pathogenic ""loss of function"" (LOF) variants have not been described. Family-based genetic analysis of GME individuals with cardiomyopathic disease identified an Iranian patient with dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) as a carrier of a novel, homozygous single nucleotide insertion in JPH2 resulting in a stop codon (JPH2-p.E641*). A second Iranian family with consanguineous parents hosting an identical heterozygous variant had 2 children die in childhood from cardiac failure. To characterize ethnicity-dependent genetic variability in JPH2 and to identify homozygous JPH2 variants associated with cardiac disease, we identified variants in JPH2 in a worldwide control cohort (gnomAD) and 2 similar cohorts from the Greater Middle East (GME Variome, Iranome). These were compared against ethnicity-matched clinical whole exome sequencing (WES) referral tests and a case cohort of individuals with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) based on comprehensive review of the literature. Worldwide, 1.45% of healthy individuals hosted a rare JPH2 variant with a significantly higher proportion among GME individuals (4.45%); LOF variants were rare overall (0.04%) yet were most prevalent in GME (0.21%). The increased prevalence of LOF variants in GME individuals was corroborated among region-specific, clinical WES cohorts. In conclusion, we report ethnic-specific differences in JPH2 rare variants, with GME individuals being at higher risk of hosting homozygous LOF variants. This conclusion is supported by the identification of a novel JPH2 LOF variant confirmed by segregation analysis resulting in autosomal recessive pediatric DCM due to presumptive JPH2 truncation.",,,galehdari187@yahoo.com.

We implemented a machine-learning-based approach (idTRAX), which relates cell-based screening of small-molecule compounds to their kinase inhibition data, to directly identify effective and readily druggable targets. We applied idTRAX to triple-negative breast cancer cell lines and efficiently identified cancer-selective targets. For example, we found that inhibiting AKT selectively kills MFM-223 and CAL148 cells, while inhibiting FGFR2 only kills MFM-223. Since the effects of catalytically inhibiting a protein can diverge from those of reducing its levels, targets identified by idTRAX frequently differ from those identified through gene knockout/knockdown methods. This is critical if the purpose is to identify targets specifically for small-molecule drug development, whereby idTRAX may produce fewer false-positives. The rapid nature of the approach suggests that it may be applicable in personalizing therapy.",,,halali@med.miami.edu.
30897808,Acquired Resistance to Antibody-Drug Conjugates.,,Cancers,10.3390/cancers11030394,"Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) combine the tumor selectivity of antibodies with the potency of cytotoxic small molecules thereby constituting antibody-mediated chemotherapy. As this inherently limits the adverse effects of the chemotherapeutic, such approaches are heavily pursued by pharma and biotech companies and have resulted in four FDA (Food and Drug Administration)-approved ADCs. However, as with other cancer therapies, durable responses are limited by the fact that under cell stress exerted by these drugs, tumors can acquire mechanisms of escape. Resistance can develop against the antibody component of ADCs by down-regulation/mutation of the targeted cell surface antigen or against payload toxicity by up-regulation of drug efflux transporters. Unique resistance mechanisms specific for the mode of action of ADCs have also emerged, like altered internalization or cell surface recycling of the targeted tumor antigen, changes in the intracellular routing or processing of ADCs, and impaired release of the toxic payload into the cytosol. These evasive changes are tailored to the specific nature and interplay of the three ADC constituents: the antibody, the linker, and the payload. Hence, they do not necessarily endow broad resistance to ADC therapy. This review summarizes preclinical and clinical findings that shed light on the mechanisms of acquired resistance to ADC therapies.",Bossenmaier B; Kollmorgen G; Niederfellner G,Roche Diagnostics GmbH; Beoro Therapeutics GmbH; Pieris Pharmaceuticals GmbH,denis.collins@dcu.ie.

Clinical experience with response prediction based on PD-L1 expression suggests that other factors influence sensitivity to ICIs in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. Tumor specimens from 120 NSCLC patients from 10 institutions were evaluated for PD-L1 expression by immunohistochemistry, and global proliferative profile by targeted RNA-seq. Cell proliferation, derived from the mean expression of 10 proliferation-associated genes (namely BUB1, CCNB2, CDK1, CDKN3, FOXM1, KIAA0101, MAD2L1, MELK, MKI67, and TOP2A), was identified as a marker of response to ICIs in NSCLC. Poorly, moderately, and highly proliferative tumors were somewhat equally represented in NSCLC, with tumors with the highest PD-L1 expression being more frequently moderately proliferative as compared to lesser levels of PD-L1 expression. Proliferation status had an impact on survival in patients with both PD-L1 positive and negative tumors. There was a significant survival advantage for moderately proliferative tumors compared to their combined highly/poorly counterparts (p = 0.021). Moderately proliferative PD-L1 positive tumors had a median survival of 14.6 months that was almost twice that of PD-L1 negative highly/poorly proliferative at 7.6 months (p = 0.028). Median survival in moderately proliferative PD-L1 negative tumors at 12.6 months was comparable to that of highly/poorly proliferative PD-L1 positive tumors at 11.5 months, but in both instances less than that of moderately proliferative PD-L1 positive tumors. Similar to survival, proliferation status has impact on disease control (DC) in patients with both PD-L1 positive and negative tumors. Patients with moderately versus those with poorly or highly proliferative tumors have a superior DC rate when combined with any classification schema used to score PD-L1 as a positive result (i.e., TPS ≥ 50% or ≥ 1%), and best displayed by a DC rate for moderately proliferative tumors of no less than 40% for any classification of PD-L1 as a negative result. While there is an over representation of moderately proliferative tumors as PD-L1 expression increases this does not account for the improved survival or higher disease control rates seen in PD-L1 negative tumors. Cell proliferation is potentially a new biomarker of response to ICIs in NSCLC and is applicable to PD-L1 negative tumors.",Pabla S; Conroy JM; Nesline MK; Glenn ST; Papanicolau-Sengos A; Burgher B; Hagen J; Giamo V; Andreas J; Lenzo FL; Yirong W; Dressler L; Steciuk M; Binns O; Gardner M; Morrison C,OmniSeq; Mission Health System,Carl.Morrison@OmniSeq.com.

PCC 6803 is a photosynthetic bacterium that has been genetically modified to produce industrially relevant chemicals, yet efflux mechanisms have not been well elucidated. These photosynthetic organisms live in environments that are often nutrient limited; therefore, the genome of these organisms encodes far fewer proteins used for efflux of chemicals when compared to members of the Enterobacteriaceae family. Understanding efflux mechanisms can lead to a greater efficiency of chemical production within the cyanobacterial cell. Both sll0180 and slr2131 genes that encode the Sll0180 and Slr2131 proteins, respectively, were removed from Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 and SD277, a high fatty acid-producing Synechocystis-based strain, to test the hypothesis that Sll0180 and Slr2131 contribute to the efflux of chemicals out of Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 and SD277. The mutant Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 and SD277 strains with either sll0180 or slr2131 removed from the chromosome had significantly decreased half maximal inhibitory concentrations to various antibiotics. The free fatty acid (FFA) concentration of the SD277 mutant strains increased intracellularly yet decreased extracellularly indicating that Sll0180 and Slr2131 have a role in FFA efflux. E. coli wild-type gene acrA (a homolog to sll0180) was added on a plasmid to the respective mutant strains lacking the sll0180 gene. Similarly, the E. coli wild-type gene acrB (a homolog to slr2131) was added to the respective mutant strains lacking the slr2131 gene. The tolerance to chloramphenicol of each mutant strain containing the wild-type E. coli gene was restored when compared to the parent stains. The extracellular FFA concentration of SD277 Δslr2131 with E. coli acrB increased significantly compared to both SD277 and SD277 Δslr2131. Two proteins involved in the transportation of antibiotics and FFAs out of the Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 cell were identified. In an effort to alleviate costs associated with mechanically or chemically separating the cells from the FFAs, the combination of genome editing of SD277 and the addition of exogenous transport gene increased extracellular concentrations of FFAs. This understanding of active transportation is critical to improving the production efficiency for all industrially relevant chemicals produced in Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803.",,,mbellefl@asu.edu.

The general consensus is that achieving a sustained remission of infection in the absence of antiretroviral therapy will involve a combination of strategies that involve both the targeting of the latent proviral genome and the induction of more effective anti-HIV-1 immune responses. Efforts to reverse HIV-1 proviral DNA integration in the host cell genome and those to enhance anti-HIV immunity have been disappointing thus far. The lack of clinically validated assays to measure both effects has hampered the development of effective therapies.

Dysfunctional RyR2 subunits trigger inappropriate calcium leak from the tetrameric channel resulting in potentially lethal ventricular tachycardia. In vivo CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene editing is a promising strategy that could be used to eliminate the disease-causing Ryr2 allele and hence rescue catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia. To determine if somatic in vivo genome editing using the CRISPR/Cas9 system delivered by adeno-associated viral (AAV) vectors could correct catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia arrhythmias in mice heterozygous for RyR2 mutation R176Q (R176Q/+). Guide RNAs were designed to specifically disrupt the R176Q allele in the R176Q/+ mice using the SaCas9 ( Staphylococcus aureus Cas9) genome editing system. AAV serotype 9 was used to deliver Cas9 and guide RNA to neonatal mice by single subcutaneous injection at postnatal day 10. Strikingly, none of the R176Q/+ mice treated with AAV-CRISPR developed arrhythmias, compared with 71% of R176Q/+ mice receiving control AAV serotype 9. Total Ryr2 mRNA and protein levels were significantly reduced in R176Q/+ mice, but not in wild-type littermates. Targeted deep sequencing confirmed successful and highly specific editing of the disease-causing R176Q allele. No detectable off-target mutagenesis was observed in the wild-type Ryr2 allele or the predicted putative off-target site, confirming high specificity for SaCas9 in vivo. In addition, confocal imaging revealed that gene editing normalized the enhanced Ca AAV serotype 9-based delivery of the SaCas9 system can efficiently disrupt a disease-causing allele in cardiomyocytes in vivo.

Filoviruses cause rare but fatal viral hemorrhagic fevers (VHFs) in remote villages of equatorial Africa with potential for regional and international spread. Point-of-care (POC) rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) are critical for early epidemic detection, reponse and control. There are 2 RDTs for Zaire ebolavirus (EBOV), but not other Ebolavirus spp. or Marburg marburgvirus (MARV). We validate 3 conserved B cell epitopes of filovirus glycoprotein (GP) using ebola virus diseases (EVD) survivor samples, towards devising pan-filovirus RDTs. In-silico Immuno-informatics:- (a) multiple and basic local alignments of amino-acid sequences of filovirus (4 Ebolavirus spp. & MARV) Gp1, 2 and epitope prediction and conservation analyses within context of ClusterW, BLAST-P and the immune epitope database analysis resource (IEDB-AR); alongside (b) in-vitro enzyme immuno-assays (EIAs) for SUDV Gp1, 2 antigen and host-specific antibodies (IgM and IgG) among 94 gamma irradiated EVD survivor serum and 9 negative controls. Linear B cell epitopes were present across the entire length of all Gp1, 2, most lying in the region between amino acids positioned 350 and 500. Three seperate epitopes 97/80_GAFFLYDRLAST, 39_YEAGEWAENCY and 500_CGLRQLANETTQALQLFLRATTELR (designated UG-Filo-Peptide- 1, 2 and 3 respectively) were conserved within all studied filovirus species Gp1, 2. Gp1, 2 host specific IgM levels were comparably low (av. ODs < 0.04 [95% CI: 0.02837 to 0.04033]) among the 9 negative controls and 57 survivor samples analyzed. Host specific IgG levels, on the other hand, were elevated (av. ODs > 1.7525 [95% CI: 0.3010 to 3.1352]) among the 92 survivor samples relative to the 9 negative controls (av. ODs < 0.2.321 [95% CI: -0.7596 to 0.5372]). Filovirus Gp1, 2 antigen was not detected [av. ODs < 0.20] within EVD survivor serum relative to recombinant protein positive controls [av. ODs = 0.50].

In chronic kidney disease, hyperuricemia is extremely common, and uric acid (UA) excretion relies on gut uricolysis by gut microbiota. Current therapy for lowering serum UA includes drugs that may produce undesired secondary effects. Therefore, this pilot study was designed to evaluate the potential of two probiotic supplements to reduce systemic uric acid concentrations. Secondary objectives were to assess whether the hypouricemic effect related to a therapeutic benefit on the hyperuricemia-induced renal damage and hypertension. Analysis of fecal microbiota was also performed. Groups of 6 rats each were followed for 5 weeks and allocated in the following treatment groups: C = Control; HU-ND = Oxonic acid-induced hyperuricemia (HU) +regular diet; HU-P = HU+placebo; HU-F1 = HU+ probiotics formula 1 and HU-F2 = HU+ probiotics formula 2. We confirmed that oxonic acid-induced hyperuricemia produced hypertension and renal functional and structural changes, along with modest changes in the overall composition of fecal microbiota. Both probiotic-containing diets prevented HU, elevated UA urinary excretion and intrarenal UA accumulation induced by oxonic acid. The hypouricemic effect conferred by probiotic supplementation also prevented the renal changes and hypertension caused by hyperuricemia. However, probiotic treatment did not restore the fecal microbiota. In conclusion, we demonstrated for the first time the ability of probiotics containing uricolytic bacteria to lower serum uric acid in hyperuricemic animals with beneficial consequences on blood pressure and renal disease. As probiotics supplements are innocuous for human health, we recommend clinical studies to test if probiotic supplements could benefit hyperuricemic individuals.",Soto V; Ranganathan N; Ranganathan P; Vyas U; Irvin A,Kibow Biotech; Dept.of Pathology,

The 6'- N-(2-hydroxyethyl) modification results in a moderate increase in prokaryotic/eukaryotic ribosomal selectivity, whereas the 1- N-(4-amino-2 S-hydroxybutyryl) modification has the opposite effect. When combined in plazomicin, the effects of the two groups on ribosomal selectivity cancel each other out, leading to the prediction that plazomicin will exhibit ototoxicity comparable to those of the parent and the current clinical aminoglycoside antibiotics gentamicin and tobramycin, as borne out by ex vivo studies with mouse cochlear explants. The 6'- N-(2-hydroxyethyl) modification restores antibacterial activity in the presence of the AAC(6') aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes, while the 1- N-(4-amino-2 S-hydroxybutyryl) modification overcomes resistance to the AAC(2') class but is still affected to some extent by the AAC(3) class.

Large-scale genetic association studies have more than doubled the number of genetic loci associated with atrial fibrillation during the last year. Studies examining how genes at or near these loci can affect the pathogenesis of atrial fibrillation are ongoing in cellular, animal, and computational models. In addition, several recent clinical studies have also demonstrated that variants at these loci can aid in risk stratification of patients. There are now over 30 genetic loci associated with atrial fibrillation.

The French Medical Pharmacology is structured and positioned to play a major role in orphan drug research and development due to the required expertise concentrated into pharmacology departments, exclusively implemented within the French university hospitals, public hospitals that are linked to a medical school (and often a pharmacy school) with numerous INSERM or CNRS labelled research units. In addition, these structures allow a close collaboration between researchers, academic institutions and biotech start-up (most of them being spin-off of the academic structures). Also, within university hospitals are located the clinical investigation centres, linking to the F-CRIN network and also to Inserm and hospitals, that enable care staff and researchers to be associated and clinical research protocols to be carried out on site, in full respect with ethic and regulatory aspects. As a consequence, this intra and multidisciplinary expertise offers all resource to elaborate a tailored approach for orphan drug development, in new entities as well as in repositioning. For preclinical development: drug screening, candidate selection (taking into account PK, metabolism, variability and potential toxicity) and preclinical models (iPS, animal models) that could allow a better translation to human research. For clinical development, we will mention here dose determination, safety evaluation and Orphan Drug Designation and Protocol Assistance preparation and submission. For post marketing evaluation and surveys, the pharmacovigilance, addictovigilance and pharmacoepidemiology expertise, combined with access to large databases allow a better approach to orphan drug use and safety.

The calcium-dependent protease, calpain, has been shown to be involved in TBI-induced neuronal death. However, whereas various calpain inhibitors have been tested in several animal models of TBI, there has not been any clinical trial testing the efficacy of calpain inhibitors in human TBI. One important reason for this could be the lack of knowledge regarding the differential functions of the two major calpain isoforms in the brain, calpain-1 and calpain-2. In this study, we used the controlled cortical impact (CCI) model in mice to test the roles of calpain-1 and calpain-2 in TBI-induced neuronal death. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) with calpain activity markers performed at different time-points after CCI in wild-type and calpain-1 knock-out (KO) mice showed that calpain-1 was activated early in cortical areas surrounding the impact, within 0-8 h after CCI, whereas calpain-2 activation was delayed and was predominant during 8-72 h after CCI. Calpain-1 KO enhanced cell death, whereas calpain-2 activity correlated with the extent of cell death, suggesting that calpain-1 activation suppresses and calpain-2 activation promotes cell death following TBI. Systemic injection(s) of a calpain-2 selective inhibitor, NA101, at 1 h or 4 h after CCI significantly reduced calpain-2 activity and cell death around the impact site, reduced the lesion volume, and promoted motor and learning function recovery after TBI. Our data indicate that calpain-1 activity is neuroprotective and calpain-2 activity is neurodegenerative after TBI, and that a selective calpain-2 inhibitor can reduce TBI-induced cell death.",,,

By combining ELISA, immunoblotting and tissue microarray, we demonstrated that, in ccRCC, urinary excretion of RKIP and its phosphorylated form (p-RKIP) reflected the tissue expression of these putative biomarkers. Baseline urinary RKIP, evaluated in an independent cohort of 56 ccRCC patients and 28 HS, successfully distinguished both groups and, most importantly, a cut-off value of 10 ng/mg/g Pr/uCr enabled a highly accurate prediction of Cancer-specific survival and Progression-free survival. Furthermore, p-RKIP was totally undetectable in both tissue and urine samples of ccRCC, showing a great potential for diagnostics purposes.Our data indicate that urinary RKIP encompasses both the unphosphorylated and the phosphorylated form and that their combined evaluation can help in the diagnosis and prognosis of ccRCC.",,,

Accordingly, here we examined the effect of a fusion protein construct targeting the DNA glycosylase, Ogg1, to mitochondria in a rat model intra-tracheal Pseudomonas aeruginosa (strain 103; PA103)-induced ALI and MOSF. Relative to controls, animals given PA103 displayed increases in lung vascular filtration coefficient accompanied by transient lung tissue oxidative mtDNA damage and variable changes in mtDNA copy number without evidence of nuclear DNA damage. The approximate 40% of animals surviving 24 h after bacterial administration exhibited multiple organ dysfunction, manifest as increased serum and tissue-specific indices of kidney and liver failure, along with depressed heart rate and blood pressure. While administration of mt-targeted Ogg1 to control animals was innocuous, the active fusion protein, but not a DNA repair-deficient mutant, prevented bacteria-induced increases in lung tissue oxidative mtDNA damage, failed to alter mtDNA copy number, and attenuated lung endothelial barrier degradation. These changes were associated with suppression of liver, kidney, and cardiovascular dysfunction and with decreased 24 h mortality.

Our aim was to study whether the previously reported high levels of ANGPTL4 detected in serum from patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) by ELISA was due to any specific molecular form of this protein (oligomers, monomers or fragments). ANGPTL4 levels were first determined in serum from 68 RA patients and 43 age and sex matched control subjects and the mean values differed by a factor of 5.0. Then, ANGPTL4 was analyzed after size exclusion chromatography (SEC) of serum samples. With serum from one of the RA patients with high levels of ANGPTL4, the dominant reactivity was found in fractions corresponding to high-molecular weight proteins. In addition, a minor peak of reactivity eluting late from the column was found both in the patient and in controls. By the use of HeteroBlock®, and by careful selection of antibodies, we documented non-specific reactions for ANGPTL4 in 39% of samples from the RA patients, most likely due to cross-reactivity of the antibodies with rheumatoid factor (RF). The corresponding figure for control subjects was 6.3%. After corrections for non-specific reactions, the mean level of ANGPTL4 in serum from RA patients was still significantly higher than in control individuals (mean levels were 101±62 and 67±39 ng/ml respectively, P = 0.02).

Licensed HPV vaccines contain virus-like particles (VLP) self-assembled from L1 major capsid proteins that provide type-restricted protection against mucosal HPV infections causing cervical and other ano-genital and oro-pharyngeal carcinomas and warts (condylomas), but do not target heterologous HPV. Experimental papillomavirus vaccines have been designed based on L2 minor capsid proteins that contain type-common neutralization epitopes, to broaden protection to heterologous mucosal and cutaneous HPV types. Repetitive display of the HPV16 L2 cross-neutralization epitope RG1 (amino acids (aa) 17-36) on the surface of HPV16 L1 VLP has greatly enhanced immunogenicity of the L2 peptide. To more directly target cutaneous HPV, L1 fusion proteins were designed that incorporate the RG1 homolog of beta HPV17, the beta HPV5 L2 peptide aa53-72, or the common cutaneous HPV4 RG1 homolog, inserted into DE surface loops of HPV1, 5, 16 or 18 L1 VLP scaffolds. Baculovirus expressed chimeric proteins self-assembled into VLP and VLP-raised NZW rabbit immune sera were evaluated by ELISA and L1- and L2-based pseudovirion (PsV) neutralizing assays, including 12 novel beta PsV types. Chimeric VLP displaying the HPV17 RG1 epitope, but not the HPV5L2 aa53-72 epitope, induced cross-neutralizing humoral immune responses to beta HPV.

27978541,Effective Feature Selection for Classification of Promoter Sequences.,2017-06-29,PloS one,10.1371/journal.pone.0167165,"Exploring novel computational methods in making sense of biological data has not only been a necessity, but also productive. A part of this trend is the search for more efficient in silico methods/tools for analysis of promoters, which are parts of DNA sequences that are involved in regulation of expression of genes into other functional molecules. Promoter regions vary greatly in their function based on the sequence of nucleotides and the arrangement of protein-binding short-regions called motifs. In fact, the regulatory nature of the promoters seems to be largely driven by the selective presence and/or the arrangement of these motifs. Here, we explore computational classification of promoter sequences based on the pattern of motif distributions, as such classification can pave a new way of functional analysis of promoters and to discover the functionally crucial motifs. We make use of Position Specific Motif Matrix (PSMM) features for exploring the possibility of accurately classifying promoter sequences using some of the popular classification techniques. The classification results on the complete feature set are low, perhaps due to the huge number of features. We propose two ways of reducing features. Our test results show improvement in the classification output after the reduction of features. The results also show that decision trees outperform SVM (Support Vector Machine), KNN (K Nearest Neighbor) and ensemble classifier LibD3C, particularly with reduced features. The proposed feature selection methods outperform some of the popular feature transformation methods such as PCA and SVD. Also, the methods proposed are as accurate as MRMR (feature selection method) but much faster than MRMR. Such methods could be useful to categorize new promoters and explore regulatory mechanisms of gene expressions in complex eukaryotic species.",K K; P G L; Rangarajan L,DoS in Computer Science,

In partial support of this idea, a wide range of contractile phenomena are reproduced without the need to invoke cooperative interactions or ad hoc states/transitions. However, remaining limitations exist, associated with ambiguities in available data for model definition e.g.: (1) the affinity of weakly bound cross-bridges, (2) the characteristics of the cross-bridge elasticity and (3) the exact mechanistic relationship between the force-generating transition and phosphate release in the actomyosin ATPase. Further, the simulated number of attached myosin heads in the in vitro motility assay differs several-fold from duty ratios, (fraction of strongly attached ATPase cycle times) derived in standard analysis. After addressing the mentioned issues the model should be useful in fundamental studies, for engineering of myosin motors as well as for studies of muscle disease and drug development.",,,alf.mansson@lnu.se.

Using VEGF-stimulated vascular endothelial cells (VECs) isolated from microvessels, venous and arterial blood vessels as in vitro angiogenic models and unstimulated VECs as a quiescent VEC model, we examined the expression of tissue factor (TF), a membrane-bound receptor on the angiogenic VEC models compared with quiescent VEC controls. We found that TF is specifically expressed on angiogenic VECs in a time-dependent manner in microvessels, venous and arterial vessels. TF-targeted therapeutic agents, including factor VII (fVII)-IgG1 Fc and fVII-conjugated photosensitizer, can selectively bind angiogenic VECs, but not the quiescent VECs. Moreover, fVII-targeted photodynamic therapy can selectively and completely eradicate angiogenic VECs. We conclude that TF is an angiogenic-specific receptor and the target molecule for fVII-targeted therapeutics. This study supports clinical trials of TF-targeted therapeutics for the treatment of angiogenesis-dependent diseases such as cancer, macular degeneration and endometriosis.",,,zhiwei.hu@osumc.edu.

Co-expression of both a multiplex of HIV-1-specific gRNAs and Cas9 in cells results in the modification and/or excision of the segment of viral DNA, leading to replication-defective virus. In this study, we have personalized the activity of CRISPR/Cas9 by placing the gene encoding Cas9 under the control of a minimal promoter of HIV-1 that is activated by the HIV-1 Tat protein. We demonstrate that functional activation of CRISPR/Cas9 by Tat during the course of viral infection excises the designated segment of the integrated viral DNA and consequently suppresses viral expression. This strategy was also used in a latently infected CD4+ T-cell model after treatment with a variety of HIV-1 stimulating agents including PMA and TSA.

HPV vaccination and/or cervical cancer screening among females may reduce the burden of HPV-related diseases, including cervical cancer. However, limited funds may impede the implementation of population-based programmes. Governmental investments in the prevention of infectious disease may have broader economic and fiscal benefits, which are not accounted in conventional economic analyses. This study estimates the broader economic and fiscal impacts of implementing HPV vaccination and/or cervical cancer screening in Indonesia from the perspective of the government. A government-perspective quantitative analytic framework was applied to assess the Net Present Value (NPV) of investment on cervical cancer prevention strategies including HPV vaccination, cervical screening and its combination in Indonesia. All monetary values were presented in International Dollars (I$). Based on a cohort of 10,000,000 Indonesian 12-year-old females, it was estimated that HPV vaccination and/or cervical cancer screening result in a positive NPV for the Indonesian government. The combination of cervical screening and HPV vaccination generated a substantial reduction of cervical cancer incidence and HPV-related mortality of 87,862 and 19,359, respectively. It was estimated that HPV vaccination in combination with cervical screening is the most favorable option for cervical cancer prevention (NPV I$2.031.786.000), followed by HPV vaccination alone (NPV I$1.860.783.000) and cervical screening alone (NPV I$375.244.000). In addition to clinical benefits, investing in HPV vaccination and cervical screening may yield considerable fiscal benefits for the Indonesian governments due to lifelong benefits resulting from reduction of cervical cancer-related morbidity and mortality.",,,
27381181,Evidence for the Role of BAG3 in Mitochondrial Quality Control in Cardiomyocytes.,2017-05-08,Journal of cellular physiology,10.1002/jcp.25476,"Mitochondrial abnormalities impact the development of myofibrillar myopathies. Therefore, understanding the mechanisms underlying the removal of dysfunctional mitochondria from cells is of great importance toward understanding the molecular events involved in the genesis of cardiomyopathy. Earlier studies have ascribed a role for BAG3 in the development of cardiomyopathy in experimental animals leading to the identification of BAG3 mutations in patients with heart failure which may play a part in the onset of disease development and progression. BAG3 is co-chaperone of heat shock protein 70 (HSP70), which has been shown to modulate apoptosis and autophagy, in several cell models. In this study, we explore the potential role of BAG3 in mitochondrial quality control. We demonstrate that siRNA mediated suppression of BAG3 production in neonatal rat ventricular cardiomyocytes (NRVCs) significantly elevates the level of Parkin, a key component of mitophagy. We found that both BAG3 and Parkin are recruited to depolarized mitochondria and promote mitophagy. Suppression of BAG3 in NRVCs significantly reduces autophagy flux and eliminates clearance of Tom20, an essential import receptor for mitochondria proteins, after induction of mitophagy. These observations suggest that BAG3 is critical for the maintenance of mitochondrial homeostasis under stress conditions, and disruptions in BAG3 expression impact cardiomyocyte function. J. Cell.

Here we report use of a glioma specific HSV-1 amplicon virus (SU4-124 HSV-1) to selectively target tumour cells. To achieve transcriptional regulation of the SU4-124 HSV-1 virus, the promoter for the essential HSV-1 gene ICP4 was replaced with a tumour specific survivin promoter. Translational regulation was achieved by incorporating 5 copies of microRNA 124 target sequences into the 3'UTR of the ICP4 gene. Additionally, a 5'UTR of rat fibroblast growth factor -2 was added in front of the viral ICP4 gene open reading frame. Our results confirmed enhanced expression of survivin and eIF4E in different glioma cells and increased micro-RNA124 expression in normal human and mouse brain tissue. SU4-124 HSV-1 had an increased ICP4 expression and virus replication in different glioma cells compared to normal neuronal cells. SU4-124 HSV-1 exerted a strong antitumour effect against a panel of glioma cell lines. Intracranial injection of SU4-124 HSV-1 did not reveal any sign of toxicity on day 15 after the injection. Moreover, a significantly enhanced antitumour effect with the intratumourally injected SU4-124 HSV-1 virus was demonstrated in mice bearing human glioma U87 tumours, whereas viral DNA was almost undetectable in normal organs. Our study indicates that incorporation of multiple cancer-specific regulators in an HSV-1 system significantly enhances both cancer specificity and oncolytic activity.",,,

Genetic deficiencies in the GLB1 gene encoding acid β-galactosidase lead to GM1-gangliosidosis or Morquio B, lysosomal diseases with predominant disease manifestation associated with the central nervous system or skeletal system, respectively. Current lysosomal ERTs are delivered into cells based on receptor-mediated endocytosis and do not effectively address several hard-to-treat organs including those critical for GM1-gangliosidosis patients. Lectins provide alternative cell-uptake mechanisms based on adsorptive-mediated endocytosis and thus may provide unique biodistribution for lysosomal disease therapeutics. In the current study, genetic fusions of the plant galactose/galactosamine-binding lectin, RTB, and the human acid β-galactosidase enzyme were produced using a plant-based bioproduction platform. β-gal:RTB and RTB:β-gal fusion products retained both lectin activity and β-galactosidase activity. Purified proteins representing both fusion orientations were efficiently taken up into GM1 patient fibroblasts and mediated the reduction of GM1 ganglioside substrate with activities matching mammalian cell-derived β-galactosidase. In contrast, plant-derived β-gal alone was enzymatically active but did not mediate uptake or correction indicating the need for either lectin-based (plant product) or mannose-6-phosphate-based (mammalian product) delivery. Native β-galactosidase undergoes catalytic activation (cleavage within the C-terminal region) in lysosomes and is stabilized by association with protective protein/cathepsin A. Enzymatic activity and lysosomal protein processing of the RTB fusions were assessed following internalization into GM1 fibroblasts. Within 1-4h, both β-gal:RTB and RTB:β-gal were processed to the ~64kDa ""activated"" β-gal form; the RTB lectin was cleaved and rapidly degraded. The activated β-gal was still detected at 48h suggesting interactions with protective protein/cathepsin A. Uptake-saturation analyses indicated that the RTB adsorptive-mediated mechanisms of β-gal:RTB supported significantly greater accumulation of β-galactose activity in fibroblasts compared to the receptor-mediated mechanisms of the mammalian cell-derived β-gal. These data demonstrate that plant-made β-gal:RTB functions as an effective replacement enzyme for GM1-gangliosidosis - delivering enzyme into cells, enabling essential lysosomal processing, and mediating disease substrate clearance at the cellular level. RTB provides novel uptake behaviors and thus may provide new receptor-independent strategies that could broadly impact lysosomal disease treatments.",,,cramer@biostrategies-lc.com.

The uPAR specific peptide AE105 was conjugated to the macrocyclic chelator DOTA and labeled with (64)Cu for targeted molecular imaging with PET. The safety, pharmacokinetic, biodistribution profile and radiation dosimetry after a single intravenous dose of (64)Cu-DOTA-AE105 were assessed by serial PET and computed tomography (CT) in 4 prostate, 3 breast and 3 bladder cancer patients. Safety assessment with laboratory blood screening tests was performed before and after PET ligand injection. In a subgroup of the patients, the in vivo stability of our targeted PET ligand was determined in collected blood and urine. No adverse or clinically detectable side effects in any of the 10 patients were found. The ligand exhibited good in vivo stability and fast clearance from plasma and tissue compartments by renal excretion. In addition, high uptake in both primary tumor lesions and lymph node metastases was seen and paralleled high uPAR expression in excised tumor tissue. Overall, this first-in-human study therefore provides promising evidence for safe use of (64)Cu-DOTA-AE105 for uPAR PET imaging in cancer patients.",,,
26511855,Nanoparticle Targeting and Cholesterol Flux Through Scavenger Receptor Type B-1 Inhibits Cellular Exosome Uptake.,2016-09-23,Scientific reports,10.1038/srep15724,"Exosomes are nanoscale vesicles that mediate intercellular communication. Cellular exosome uptake mechanisms are not well defined partly due to the lack of specific inhibitors of this complex cellular process. Exosome uptake depends on cholesterol-rich membrane microdomains called lipid rafts, and can be blocked by non-specific depletion of plasma membrane cholesterol. Scavenger receptor type B-1 (SR-B1), found in lipid rafts, is a receptor for cholesterol-rich high-density lipoproteins (HDL). We hypothesized that a synthetic nanoparticle mimic of HDL (HDL NP) that binds SR-B1 and removes cholesterol through this receptor would inhibit cellular exosome uptake. In cell models, our data show that HDL NPs bind SR-B1, activate cholesterol efflux, and attenuate the influx of esterified cholesterol. As a result, HDL NP treatment results in decreased dynamics and clustering of SR-B1 contained in lipid rafts and potently inhibits cellular exosome uptake. Thus, SR-B1 and targeted HDL NPs provide a fundamental advance in studying cholesterol-dependent cellular uptake mechanisms.",,,

Fusion proteins comprised of RTB and human α-L-iduronidase, the corrective enzyme for Mucopolysaccharidosis type I, were produced using a tobacco-based expression system. Fusion products retained both lectin selectivity and enzyme activity, were efficiently endocytosed into human fibroblasts, and corrected the disease phenotype of mucopolysaccharidosis patient fibroblasts in vitro.

Its main reasons of failure are lack of efficacy and toxicity of a drug candidate. Binding affinity for the biological target has been usually considered one of the most relevant figures of merit to judge a drug candidate along with bioavailability, selectivity and metabolic properties, which could depend on off-target interactions. Nevertheless, affinity does not always satisfactorily correlate with in vivo drug efficacy. It is indeed becoming increasingly evident that the time a drug spends in contact with its target (aka residence time) can be a more reliable figure of merit. Experimental kinetic measurements are operatively limited by the cost and the time needed to synthesize compounds to be tested, to express and purify the target, and to setup the assays. We present here a simple and efficient molecular-dynamics-based computational approach to prioritize compounds according to their residence time. We devised a multiple-replica scaled molecular dynamics protocol with suitably defined harmonic restraints to accelerate the unbinding events while preserving the native fold. Ligands are ranked according to the mean observed scaled unbinding time.

Cell signaling components involved in neutrophil migration represent targets for novel anti-inflammatory therapies. In order to migrate into tissue, neutrophils must respond to chemoattractant signals in their external environment through activation of adhesion receptors (i.e. integrins) and reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton. Myristoylated Alanine-Rich C-Kinase Substrate (MARCKS), a highly conserved actin-binding protein, has a well demonstrated role in cytoskeletal dependent cellular functions (i.e. adhesion, spreading, and migration), but the details of MARCKS involvement in these processes remain vague. We hypothesized that MARCKS serves as a link between the actin cytoskeleton and integrin function in neutrophils. Using a MARCKS-specific inhibitor peptide known as MANS on equine neutrophils in vitro, we demonstrate that inhibition of MARCKS function significantly attenuates β2-integrin-dependent neutrophil functions including migration, adhesion, and immune complex-mediated respiratory burst. The MANS peptide did not, however, inhibit the β2-integrin-independent PMA mediated respiratory burst.

The role of BSCB breakdown in ALS disease pathogenesis in humans and mice remains, however, unclear, although chronic blood-brain barrier opening has been shown to facilitate accumulation of toxic blood-derived products in the central nervous system, resulting in secondary neurodegenerative changes. By repairing the BSCB and/or removing the BSCB-derived injurious stimuli, we now identify that accumulation of blood-derived neurotoxic hemoglobin and iron in the spinal cord leads to early motor-neuron degeneration in SOD1(G93A) mice at least in part through iron-dependent oxidant stress. Using spontaneous or warfarin-accelerated microvascular lesions, motor-neuron dysfunction and injury were found to be proportional to the degree of BSCB disruption at early disease stages in SOD1(G93A) mice. Early treatment with an activated protein C analog restored BSCB integrity that developed from spontaneous or warfarin-accelerated microvascular lesions in SOD1(G93A) mice and eliminated neurotoxic hemoglobin and iron deposits. Restoration of BSCB integrity delayed onset of motor-neuron impairment and degeneration. Early chelation of blood-derived iron and antioxidant treatment mitigated early motor-neuronal injury. Our data suggest that BSCB breakdown contributes to early motor-neuron degeneration in ALS mice and that restoring BSCB integrity during an early disease phase retards the disease process.",Sengillo JD; Sagare AP; Zhao Z; Ma Q; Zuniga E; Wang Y; Zhong Z; Sullivan JS; Griffin JH; Cleveland DW; Zlokovic BV,,
28982439,Biocrystallography in Switzerland: Achievements and Future Perspectives.,,Chimia,10.2533/chimia.2014.54,"The first protein crystallography group in Switzerland was installed at the Biozentrum of the University of Basel approximately 40 years ago. Since then protein crystallography has grown and matured remarkably and is now established in the molecular biology, biochemistry or biological medicine departments of most major Swiss Universities as well as in the pharmaceutical industry and in biotech startup companies. Swiss X-ray biocrystallography groups have made remarkable contributions from the beginning and have brought Switzerland to the forefront in biostructural research during the last 5 to 10 years. Switzerland has now a leading position in the areas of supramolecular complexes, membrane proteins and structure-based drug design in pharmaceutical and biotech industries. Protein crystallography on the outer membrane protein ompF as well as the development of the lipidic cubic phase crystallization methodology has been pioneered at the Biozentrum. The latter found its somewhat late recognition through the recent explosion in structure determinations of the seven transmembrane helix G-coupled receptors. Highlights from Swiss structural biology groups in the field of supramolecular complexes include the structures of ribosomal particles, of the nucleosome and the pilus assembly complex of uropathogenic E. coli. On the membrane protein side advances in the field of ABC transporters and ion channels are world-recognized achievements of Swiss structural biology. Dedicated laboratories at many academic and industrial institutions, their current research programs, the availability of excellent infrastructure and the continuing efforts to build new facilities such as the SwissFEL indicate an even brighter future for structural biology in Switzerland.",,,gruetter@bioc.uzh.ch.
24454842,"Changes in oxidative damage, inflammation and [NAD(H)] with age in cerebrospinal fluid.",2014-09-17,PloS one,10.1371/journal.pone.0085335,"An extensive body of evidence indicates that oxidative stress and inflammation play a central role in the degenerative changes of systemic tissues in aging. However a comparatively limited amount of data is available to verify whether these processes also contribute to normal aging within the brain. High levels of oxidative damage results in key cellular changes including a reduction in available nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD(+)), an essential molecule required for a number of vital cellular processes including DNA repair, immune signaling and epigenetic processing. In this study we quantified changes in [NAD(H)] and markers of inflammation and oxidative damage (F2-isoprostanes, 8-OHdG, total antioxidant capacity) in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of healthy humans across a wide age range (24-91 years). CSF was collected from consenting patients who required a spinal tap for the administration of anesthetic. CSF of participants aged >45 years was found to contain increased levels of lipid peroxidation (F2-isoprostanes) (p = 0.04) and inflammation (IL-6) (p = 0.00) and decreased levels of both total antioxidant capacity (p = 0.00) and NAD(H) (p = 0.05), compared to their younger counterparts. A positive association was also observed between plasma [NAD(H)] and CSF NAD(H) levels (p = 0.03). Further analysis of the data identified a relationship between alcohol intake and CSF [NAD(H)] and markers of inflammation. The CSF of participants who consumed >1 standard drink of alcohol per day contained lower levels of NAD(H) compared to those who consumed no alcohol (p<0.05). An increase in CSF IL-6 was observed in participants who reported drinking >0-1 (p<0.05) and >1 (p<0.05) standard alcoholic drinks per day compared to those who did not drink alcohol. Taken together these data suggest a progressive age associated increase in oxidative damage, inflammation and reduced [NAD(H)] in the brain which may be exacerbated by alcohol intake.",,,

23991093,Evidence for sigma factor competition in the regulation of alginate production by Pseudomonas aeruginosa.,2014-06-15,PloS one,10.1371/journal.pone.0072329,"Alginate overproduction, or mucoidy, plays an important role in the pathogenesis of P. aeruginosa lung infection in cystic fibrosis (CF). Mucoid strains with mucA mutations predominantly populate in chronically-infected patients. However, the mucoid strains can revert to nonmucoidy in vitro through suppressor mutations. We screened a mariner transposon library using CF149, a non-mucoid clinical isolate with a misssense mutation in algU (AlgU(A61V)). The wild type AlgU is a stress-related sigma factor that activates transcription of alginate biosynthesis. Three mucoid mutants were identified with transposon insertions that caused 1) an overexpression of AlgU(A61V), 2) an overexpression of the stringent starvation protein A (SspA), and 3) a reduced expression of the major sigma factor RpoD (σ(70)). Induction of AlgU(A61V) in trans caused conversion to mucoidy in CF149 and PAO1DalgU, suggesting that AlgU(A61V) is functional in activating alginate production. Furthermore, the level of AlgU(A61V) was increased in all three mutants relative to CF149. However, compared to the wild type AlgU, AlgU(A61V) had a reduced activity in promoting alginate production in PAO1ΔalgU. SspA and three other anti-σ(70) orthologues, P. aeruginosa AlgQ, E. coli Rsd, and T4 phage AsiA, all induced mucoidy, suggesting that reducing activity of RpoD is linked to mucoid conversion in CF149. Conversely, RpoD overexpression resulted in suppression of mucoidy in all mucoid strains tested, indicating that sigma factor competition can regulate mucoidy. Additionally, an RpoD-dependent promoter (PssrA ) was more active in non-mucoid strains than in isogenic mucoid variants. Altogether, our results indicate that the anti-σ(70) factors can induce conversion to mucoidy in P. aeruginosa CF149 with algU-suppressor mutation via modulation of RpoD.",Withers TR; Wang X; Yu HD,,

23840497,Fibroblast Migration Is Regulated by Myristoylated Alanine-Rich C-Kinase Substrate (MARCKS) Protein.,2017-10-06,PloS one,10.1371/journal.pone.0066512,"Myristoylated alanine-rich C-kinase substrate (MARCKS) is a ubiquitously expressed substrate of protein kinase C (PKC) that is involved in reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton. We hypothesized that MARCKS is involved in regulation of fibroblast migration and addressed this hypothesis by utilizing a unique reagent developed in this laboratory, the MANS peptide. The MANS peptide is a myristoylated cell permeable peptide corresponding to the first 24-amino acids of MARCKS that inhibits MARCKS function. Treatment of NIH-3T3 fibroblasts with the MANS peptide attenuated cell migration in scratch wounding assays, while a myristoylated, missense control peptide (RNS) had no effect. Neither MANS nor RNS peptide treatment altered NIH-3T3 cell proliferation within the parameters of the scratch assay. MANS peptide treatment also resulted in inhibited NIH-3T3 chemotaxis towards the chemoattractant platelet-derived growth factor-BB (PDGF-BB), with no effect observed with RNS treatment. Live cell imaging of PDGF-BB induced chemotaxis demonstrated that MANS peptide treatment resulted in weak chemotactic fidelity compared to RNS treated cells. MANS and RNS peptides did not affect PDGF-BB induced phosphorylation of MARCKS or phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling, as measured by Akt phosphorylation. Further, no difference in cell migration was observed in NIH-3T3 fibroblasts that were transfected with MARCKS siRNAs with or without MANS peptide treatment. Genetic structure-function analysis revealed that MANS peptide-mediated attenuation of NIH-3T3 cell migration does not require the presence of the myristic acid moiety on the amino-terminus. Expression of either MANS or unmyristoylated MANS (UMANS) C-terminal EGFP fusion proteins resulted in similar levels of attenuated cell migration as observed with MANS peptide treatment. These data demonstrate that MARCKS regulates cell migration and suggests that MARCKS-mediated regulation of fibroblast migration involves the MARCKS amino-terminus. Further, this data demonstrates that MANS peptide treatment inhibits MARCKS function during fibroblast migration and that MANS mediated inhibition occurs independent of myristoylation.",Sung EJ; Melvin AT; Sheats MK; Haugh JM; Adler KB; Jones SL,,
23520510,A simple method for assessment of human anti-Neu5Gc antibodies applied to Kawasaki disease.,2013-09-10,PloS one,10.1371/journal.pone.0058443,"N-glycolylneuraminic acid (Neu5Gc) is an immunogenic sugar of dietary origin that metabolically incorporates into diverse native glycoconjugates in humans. Anti-Neu5Gc antibodies are detected in all human sera, though with variable levels and epitope-recognition profiles. These antibodies likely play a role in several inflammation-mediated pathologies including cardiovascular diseases and cancer. In cancer, they have dualistic and opposing roles, either stimulating or repressing disease, as a function of their dose, and some of these antibodies serve as carcinoma biomarkers. Thus, anti-Neu5Gc antibodies may signify risk of inflammation-mediated diseases, and changes in their levels could potentially be used to monitor disease progression and/or response to therapy. Currently, it is difficult to determine levels of anti-Neu5Gc antibodies in individual human samples because these antibodies recognize multiple Neu5Gc-epitopes. Here we describe a simple and specific method for detection and overall estimation of human anti-Neu5Gc antibodies. We exploit the difference between two mouse models that differ only by Neu5Gc-presence (wild-type) or Neu5Gc-absence (Cmah(-/-) knockout). We characterize mouse serum from both strains by HPLC, lectin and mass-spectrometry analysis and show the target Neu5Gc-epitopes. We then use Cmah(-/-) knockout sera to inhibit all non-Neu5Gc-reactivity followed by binding to wild-type sera to detect overall anti-Neu5Gc response in a single assay. We applied this methodology to characterize and quantify anti-Neu5Gc IgG and IgA in sera of patients with Kawasaki disease (KD) at various stages compared to controls. KD is an acute childhood febrile disease characterized by inflammation of coronary arteries that untreated may lead to coronary artery aneurysms with risk of thrombosis and myocardial infarction. This estimated response is comparable to the average of detailed anti-Neu5Gc IgG profile analyzed by a sialoglycan microarray. Both assays revealed an elevated response in acute KD patients with normal coronaries compared to patients with aneurysm or dilated coronaries. Implications of these findings are discussed.",Tremoulet AH; Yu H; Chen X; Burns JC; Varki A,,

In addition, actomyosin-based transportation of nanoparticles is useful in various fundamental studies. However, it is poorly understood how actomyosin function is affected by different number of nanoscale cargoes, by cargo size, and by the mode of cargo-attachment to the actin filament. This is studied here using biotin/fluorophores, streptavidin, streptavidin-coated quantum dots, and liposomes as model cargoes attached to monomers along the actin filaments (""side-attached"") or to the trailing filament end via the plus end capping protein CapZ. Long-distance transportation (>100 µm) could be seen for all cargoes independently of attachment mode but the fraction of motile filaments decreased with increasing number of side-attached cargoes, a reduction that occurred within a range of 10-50 streptavidin molecules, 1-10 quantum dots or with just 1 liposome. However, as observed by monitoring these motile filaments with the attached cargo, the velocity was little affected. This also applied for end-attached cargoes where the attachment was mediated by CapZ. The results with side-attached cargoes argue against certain models for chemomechanical energy transduction in actomyosin and give important insights of relevance for effective exploitation of actomyosin-based cargo-transportation in molecular diagnostics and other nanotechnological applications. The attachment of quantum dots via CapZ, without appreciable modulation of actomyosin function, is useful in fundamental studies as exemplified here by tracking with nanometer accuracy.",Gullberg M; Tolf C; Lindberg AM; Månsson A; Kocer A,,

However, VCA was historically performed sequentially after donor chimerism was established. Delayed VCA is not clinically applicable due to the time constraints associated with procurement from deceased donors. A more clinically relevant approach to perform both BMT and VCA simultaneously was evaluated. Wistar Furth (RT1A) rats were treated with a short course of immunosuppressive therapy (anti-αβ-TCR monoclonal antibody, FK-506, and anti-lymphocyte serum). One day before BMT, rats were treated with varying doses of total body irradiation (TBI) followed by transplantation of heterotopic osteomyocutaneous flaps from hindlimbs of August Copenhagen Irish (RT1A) rats. Eighty percent of rats conditioned with 300 cGy TBI and 40% of rats receiving 400 cGy TBI accepted the VCA. Mixed chimerism was detected in peripheral blood at 1 month after VCA, but chimerism was lost in all transplant recipients by 4 months. Most peripheral donor cells originated from the BMT and not from the VCA. Acceptors of VCA were tolerant of a donor skin graft challenge and no anti-donor antibodies were detectable, suggesting a central deletional mechanism for tolerance. Regulatory T cells (Treg) from spleens of acceptors more potently suppressed lymphocyte proliferation than Treg from rejectors in the presence of donor stimulator cells. These studies suggest that simultaneous BMT and VCA may establish indefinite allograft survival in rats through Treg-mediated suppression and thymic deletion of alloreactive T cells.",Ramsey DM; Wu S; Bozulic LD; Ildstad ST,,

In 1953, Billingham, Brent, and Medawar demonstrated that murine neonatal chimeras prepared by infusion of donor-derived hematopoietic cells exhibited donor-specific tolerance to skin allografts. Various approaches using HSCs in organ transplantation have gradually brought closer to reality the dream of inducing donor-specific tolerance in organ transplant recipients. Several hurdles needed to be overcome, especially the risk of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), the toxicity of ablative conditioning, and the need for close donor-recipient matching. For wide acceptance, HSC therapy must be safe and reproducible in mismatched donor-recipient combinations. Discoveries in other disciplines have often unexpectedly and synergistically contributed to progress in this area.

23146386,A critical role for the TLR4/TRIF pathway in allogeneic hematopoietic cell rejection by innate immune cells.,2014-08-29,Cell transplantation,10.3727/096368912X658881,"We show for the first time that signaling through the TLR4/TRIF pathway plays a critical role in allogeneic bone marrow cell (BMC) rejection. This appears to be unique to BMCs as organ allografts are rejected mainly via MyD88 signaling. Using T- or T-/B-cell-deficient mice, we found that BMC allorejection occurred early before T-cell activation and was T- and B-cell independent, suggesting an effector role for innate immune cells in BMC rejection. We further demonstrated the innate immune signaling in BMC allorejection by showing superior engraftment in mice deficient in TRIF or TLR4 but not in MyD88 or TLR3. The restored cytotoxicity in TRIF-deficient recipients transferred with wild-type F4/80(+) or NK1.1(+) cells suggests TRIF signaling dependence on macrophages or NK cells in early BMC rejection. Production of the proinflammatory cytokine IL-6 and TRIF relevant chemokine MCP-1 was significantly increased early after bone marrow transplantation. In vivo specific depletion of macrophages or NK innate immune cells in combination with anti-CD154/rapamycin resulted in additive-enhanced allogeneic engraftment. The requirement for irradiation was completely eliminated when both macrophages and NK cells were depleted in combination with anti-CD154/rapamycin to target T- and B-cells, supporting the hypothesis that two barriers involving innate and adaptive immunity exist in mediating the rejection of allogeneic BMCs. In summary, our results clearly demonstrate a previously unappreciated role for innate immunity in BMC allorejection via signaling through a unique MyD88-independent TLR4/TRIF mechanism. These findings may have direct clinical impact on strategies for conditioning recipients for stem cell transplantation.",Yan J; Zhu Z; Hussain LR; Huang Y; Ding C; Bozulic LD; Wen Y; Ildstad ST,,
23056279,Antibodies covalently immobilized on actin filaments for fast myosin driven analyte transport.,2013-06-11,PloS one,10.1371/journal.pone.0046298,"Biosensors would benefit from further miniaturization, increased detection rate and independence from external pumps and other bulky equipment. Whereas transportation systems built around molecular motors and cytoskeletal filaments hold significant promise in the latter regard, recent proof-of-principle devices based on the microtubule-kinesin motor system have not matched the speed of existing methods. An attractive solution to overcome this limitation would be the use of myosin driven propulsion of actin filaments which offers motility one order of magnitude faster than the kinesin-microtubule system. Here, we realized a necessary requirement for the use of the actomyosin system in biosensing devices, namely covalent attachment of antibodies to actin filaments using heterobifunctional cross-linkers. We also demonstrated consistent and rapid myosin II driven transport where velocity and the fraction of motile actin filaments was negligibly affected by the presence of antibody-antigen complexes at rather high density (>20 µm(-1)). The results, however, also demonstrated that it was challenging to consistently achieve high density of functional antibodies along the actin filament, and optimization of the covalent coupling procedure to increase labeling density should be a major focus for future work. Despite the remaining challenges, the reported advances are important steps towards considerably faster nanoseparation than shown for previous molecular motor based devices, and enhanced miniaturization because of high bending flexibility of actin filaments.",ten Siethoff L; Persson M; Lard M; te Kronnie G; Linke H; Månsson A,,
22848760,Age-associated changes in oxidative stress and NAD+ metabolism in human tissue.,2013-01-10,PloS one,10.1371/journal.pone.0042357,"Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD(+)) is an essential electron transporter in mitochondrial respiration and oxidative phosphorylation. In genomic DNA, NAD(+) also represents the sole substrate for the nuclear repair enzyme, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) and the sirtuin family of NAD-dependent histone deacetylases. Age associated increases in oxidative nuclear damage have been associated with PARP-mediated NAD(+) depletion and loss of SIRT1 activity in rodents. In this study, we further investigated whether these same associations were present in aging human tissue. Human pelvic skin samples were obtained from consenting patients aged between 15-77 and newborn babies (0-1 year old) (n = 49) previously scheduled for an unrelated surgical procedure. DNA damage correlated strongly with age in both males (p = 0.029; r = 0.490) and females (p = 0.003; r = 0.600) whereas lipid oxidation (MDA) levels increased with age in males (p = 0.004; r = 0.623) but not females (p = 0.3734; r = 0.200). PARP activity significantly increased with age in males (p<0.0001; r = 0.768) and inversely correlated with tissue NAD(+) levels (p = 0.0003; r = -0.639). These associations were less evident in females. A strong negative correlation was observed between NAD(+) levels and age in both males (p = 0.001; r = -0.706) and females (p = 0.01; r = -0.537). SIRT1 activity also negatively correlated with age in males (p = 0.007; r = -0.612) but not in females.

This study provides quantitative evidence in support of the hypothesis that hyperactivation of PARP due to an accumulation of oxidative damage to DNA during aging may be responsible for increased NAD(+) catabolism in human tissue. The resulting NAD(+) depletion may play a major role in the aging process, by limiting energy production, DNA repair and genomic signalling.",Grant R; Braidy N; Guest J; Farnsworth B; Guillemin GJ,,
22590549,Ordered self-assembly mechanism of a spherical oncoprotein oligomer triggered by zinc removal and stabilized by an intrinsically disordered domain.,2012-09-19,PloS one,10.1371/journal.pone.0036457,"Self-assembly is a common theme in proteins of unrelated sequences or functions. The human papillomavirus E7 oncoprotein is an extended dimer with an intrinsically disordered domain, that can form large spherical oligomers. These are the major species in the cytosol of HPV transformed and cancerous cells. E7 binds to a large number of targets, some of which lead to cell transformation. Thus, the assembly process not only is of biological relevance, but represents a model system to investigate a widely distributed mechanism. Using various techniques, we monitored changes in secondary, tertiary and quaternary structure in a time course manner. By applying a robust kinetic model developed by Zlotnik, we determined the slow formation of a monomeric ""Z-nucleus"" after zinc removal, followed by an elongation phase consisting of sequential second-order events whereby one monomer is added at a time. This elongation process takes place at a strikingly slow overall average rate of one monomer added every 28 seconds at 20 µM protein concentration, strongly suggesting either a rearrangement of the growing complex after binding of each monomer or the existence of a ""conformation editing"" mechanism through which the monomer binds and releases until the appropriate conformation is adopted. The oligomerization determinant lies within its small 5 kDa C-terminal globular domain and, remarkably, the E7 N-terminal intrinsically disordered domain stabilizes the oligomer, preventing an insoluble amyloid route. We described a controlled ordered mechanism with features in common with soluble amyloid precursors, chaperones, and other spherical oligomers, thus sharing determining factors for symmetry, size and shape. In addition, such a controlled and discrete polymerization reaction provides a valuable tool for nanotechnological applications. Finally, its increased immunogenicity related to its supramolecular structure is the basis for the development of a promising therapeutic vaccine candidate for treating HPV cancerous lesions.",Smal C; Alonso LG; Wetzler DE; Heer A; de Prat Gay G,; Fundación Instituto Leloir and Instituto de Investigaciones Bioquímicas-Conicet,

To improve the protection provided by these vaccines, we used nanoparticles made of the coat protein of a plant virus (papaya mosaic virus; PapMV) as an adjuvant. Immunization of mice and ferrets with the adjuvanted formulation increased the magnitude and breadth of the humoral response to NP and to highly conserved regions of HA. They also triggered a cellular mediated immune response to NP and M1, and long-lasting protection in animals challenged with a heterosubtypic influenza strain (WSN/33).

Skin samples from tolerant long-term allogeneic transplanted, syngeneic transplanted, rejected, and naïve animals were immunostained with fluorochrome-conjugated anti-FoxP3 and anti-CD4 monoclonal antibody and visualized under a laser confocal microscope. Significant CD4/FoxP3 Treg infiltrates were observed in tolerant donor-allograft skin samples. No graft infiltrating FoxP3 cells were observed in rejector, naïve, or skin from syngeneic CTA. In parallel experiments, mixed leukocyte reaction assays were performed to investigate the suppressor function of Treg cells. Splenocytes from tolerant, rejected, and naïve rats were sorted by flow cytometry for CD4/CD25 T cells. Treg demonstrated similar suppressive levels between the three groups. These data suggest that Treg may play an important role in maintenance of tolerance and promoting graft acceptance in long-term CTA acceptors and may explain the favorable outcomes observed in clinical CTA recipients.",Bozulic LD; Wen Y; Xu H; Ildstad ST,; Regenerex,

A central consideration for the researcher is how involved she or he will be in the commercialization process. In some cases, a university out-licenses the intellectual property, whereas in other cases, the investigator may want to be involved in the development process and choose to start his or her own company to develop and possibly to manufacture and sell the product. Before undertaking such a challenge, however, the investigator-turned-entrepreneur must consider a variety of issues, including career goals, financial and time commitments, potential conflicts of interest and/or commitment, start-up funding, and his or her ability to run a company or step aside to allow business experts to make necessary decisions. This paper discusses some personal considerations in deciding to start a spinout company and provides information on some of the available government grants to assist you should you decide to undertake your product's commercial development. In particular, the Small Business Innovative Research and Small Business Technology Transfer programs of federal funding agencies often are the source of early funding for new biomedical companies.",Smith CD,Apogee Biotechnology Corporation,cdsmith@apogee-biotech.com

However, from this major crisis is emerging a major opportunity, namely micropharma--academia-originated biotech start-up companies that are efficient, innovative, product-focused and small. In this Feature, we discuss a 'new ecosystem' for drug development, with high-risk innovation in micropharma leading to Big Pharma clinical trials; we also identify the 'five golden goals' that micropharma must strive to achieve to attain success. Although micropharma will encounter numerous hurdles on this road to success, there is room for optimism that micropharma might have the capacity to address society's growing, but unmet, need for effective therapeutics over coming years.",Weaver DF,,
19649302,Building disease-specific drug-protein connectivity maps from molecular interaction networks and PubMed abstracts.,2009-10-15,PLoS computational biology,10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000450,"The recently proposed concept of molecular connectivity maps enables researchers to integrate experimental measurements of genes, proteins, metabolites, and drug compounds under similar biological conditions. The study of these maps provides opportunities for future toxicogenomics and drug discovery applications. We developed a computational framework to build disease-specific drug-protein connectivity maps. We integrated gene/protein and drug connectivity information based on protein interaction networks and literature mining, without requiring gene expression profile information derived from drug perturbation experiments on disease samples. We described the development and application of this computational framework using Alzheimer's Disease (AD) as a primary example in three steps. First, molecular interaction networks were incorporated to reduce bias and improve relevance of AD seed proteins. Second, PubMed abstracts were used to retrieve enriched drug terms that are indirectly associated with AD through molecular mechanistic studies. Third and lastly, a comprehensive AD connectivity map was created by relating enriched drugs and related proteins in literature. We showed that this molecular connectivity map development approach outperformed both curated drug target databases and conventional information retrieval systems. Our initial explorations of the AD connectivity map yielded a new hypothesis that diltiazem and quinidine may be investigated as candidate drugs for AD treatment. Molecular connectivity maps derived computationally can help study molecular signature differences between different classes of drugs in specific disease contexts. To achieve overall good data coverage and quality, a series of statistical methods have been developed to overcome high levels of data noise in biological networks and literature mining results. Further development of computational molecular connectivity maps to cover major disease areas will likely set up a new model for drug development, in which therapeutic/toxicological profiles of candidate drugs can be checked computationally before costly clinical trials begin.",Zhu X; Chen JY,,

Although there are sophisticated off-the-shelf software solutions available, their use requires substantial forethought and attention to detail if the data they capture are to be of sufficient quality to serve the various purposes to which it will be put. For newcomers to the field of screening data management in particular, the problem is compounded by a lack of literature covering the practical aspects of managing screening data. The authors provide some practical advice based on their experience of using a commercially available software suite. They discuss issues ranging from the organizational aspects to examples of how the form and content of metadata can have a big impact on whether results can be easily queried, pivoted, and reported.

The feasibility of the procedure has been confirmed in over 40 successful hand transplants, 3 facial reconstructions, and vascularized knee, esophageal, abdominal wall, and tracheal allografts. The toxicity of chronic, nonspecific immunosuppression remains a major limitation to the widespread availability of CTA and is associated with opportunistic infections, nephrotoxicity, end-organ damage, and an increased rate of malignancy. Methods to reduce or eliminate the requirement for immunosuppression would represent a significant step forward in the field. Mixed chimerism induces tolerance to solid organ and tissue allografts, including CTA. This overview focuses on the history and expanding applications of CTA as a new frontier in transplantation, and considers the important hurdles that must be overcome through research to allow widespread clinical application.",Xu H; Ravindra K; Ildstad ST,,

The cadherin Bt-R(1) is a binding protein for Bt Cry1A toxins in midgut epithelia of tobacco hornworm (Manduca sexta). We previously identified the Bt-R(1) region most proximal to the cell membrane (CR12-MPED) as the essential binding region required for Cry1Ab-mediated cytotoxicity. Here, we report that a peptide containing this region expressed in Escherichia coli functions as a synergist of Cry1A toxicity against lepidopteran larvae. Far-UV circular dichroism and (1)H-NMR spectroscopy confirmed that our purified CR12-MPED peptide mainly consisted of beta-strands and random coils with unfolded structure. CR12-MPED peptide bound brush border membrane vesicles with high affinity (K(d) = 32 nM) and insect midgut microvilli but did not alter Cry1Ab or Cry1Ac binding localization in the midgut. By BIAcore analysis we demonstrate that Cry1Ab binds CR12-MPED at high (9 nM)- and low (1 microM)-affinity sites. CR12-MPED-mediated Cry1A toxicity enhancement was significantly reduced when the high-affinity Cry1A-binding epitope ((1416)GVLTLNIQ(1423)) within the peptide was altered. Because the mixtures of low Bt toxin dose and CR12-MPED peptide effectively control target insect pests, our discovery has important implications related to the use of this peptide to enhance insecticidal activity of Bt toxin-based biopesticides and transgenic Bt crops.",Hua G; Jurat-Fuentes JL; Abdullah MA; Adang MJ,,

Several classes of protein scaffolds proved to yield reagents with specificities and affinities in a range that was previously considered unique to antibodies. Such engineered protein scaffolds are usually obtained by designing a random library with mutagenesis focused at a loop region or at an otherwise permissible surface area and by selection of variants against a given target via phage display or related techniques. Whereas a plethora of protein scaffolds has meanwhile been proposed, only few of them were actually demonstrated to yield specificities towards different kinds of targets and to offer practical benefits such as robustness, smaller size, and ease of expression that justify their use as a true alternative to conventional antibodies or their recombinant fragments. Currently, the most promising scaffolds with broader applicability are protein A, the lipocalins, a fibronectin domain, an ankyrin consensus repeat domain, and thioredoxin. Corresponding binding proteins are not only of interest as research reagents or for separation in biotechnology but also as potential biopharmaceuticals, especially in the areas of cancer, autoimmune and infectious diseases as well as for in vivo diagnostics. The medical prospects have boosted high commercial expectations, and many of the promising scaffolds are under development by biotech start-up companies. Although some issues still have to be addressed, for example immunogenicity, effector functions, and plasma half-life in the context of therapeutic use or low-cost high-throughput selection for applications in proteomics research, it has become clear that scaffold-derived binding proteins will play an increasing role in biotechnology and medicine.",Skerra A,Lehrstuhl für Biologische Chemie,skerra@wzw.tum.de

12800716,Storytelling that moves people. A conversation with screenwriting coach Robert McKee.,2003-07-21,Harvard business review,,"When executives need to persuade an audience, most try to build a case with facts, statistics, and some quotes from authorities. In other words, they resort to ""companyspeak,"" the tools of rhetoric they have been trained to use. In this conversation with HBR, Robert McKee, the world's best-known screenwriting lecturer, argues that executives can engage people in a much deeper--and ultimately more convincing--way if they toss out their Power-Point slides and memos and learn to tell good stories. As human beings, we make sense of our experiences through stories. But becoming a good storyteller is hard. It requires imagination and an understanding of what makes a story worth telling. All great stories deal with the conflict between subjective expectations and an uncooperative objective reality. They show a protagonist wrestling with antagonizing forces, not a rosy picture of results meeting expectations--which no one ends up believing. Consider the CEO of a biotech start-up that has discovered a chemical compound to prevent heart attacks. He could make a pitch to investors by offering up market projections, the business plan, and upbeat, hypothetical scenarios. Or he could captivate them by telling the story of his father, who died of a heart attack, and of the CEO's subsequent struggle against various antagonists--nature, the FDA, potential rivals--to bring to market the effective, low-cost test that might have prevented his father's death. Good storytellers are not necessarily good leaders, but they do share certain traits. Both are self-aware, and both are skeptics who realize that all people--and institutions--wear masks. Compelling stories can be found behind those masks.",McKee R,,
