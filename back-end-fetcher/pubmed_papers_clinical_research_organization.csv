40390142,"Reliability of pre-admission patient-reported outcome measures postoperatively assessed via proxies: a prospective, multicenter observational study.",,"Critical care (London, England)",10.1186/s13054-025-05431-6,"Pre-admission status obtained through patient-reported outcome measures is an essential metric in both clinical and research settings for prognostication and treatment decisions. It is frequently collected by proxies, although its reliability has yet to be thoroughly investigated. The objective was to determine the reliability of proxy assessments regarding pre-ICU admission status via patient-reported outcome measures and to explore the impact of the ICU setting on these assessments. Prospective multicentre observational study in two tertiary care university hospitals in Germany, including surgical adult patients able to independently answer the patient-reported outcome measures (SF-36, EQ-5D-5L, WHODAS 2.0, IADL, and Barthel Index) with a proxy available. Patients were interviewed pre-operatively, while proxies were interviewed post-operatively in the ICU or normal ward, depending on the patient's location. The reliability of patient-reported outcome measures was analyzed using Bland-Altman plots and Cohen's kappa. Of 204 patient-proxy pairs, 102 were admitted to an ICU. The median patient and proxy age were 69 and 64 years, with 41% and 68% female, respectively. Bland-Altman plots demonstrated insufficient reliability of proxy ratings, as the 95% limits of agreement fell outside the minimal clinically important difference (MCID) for all questionnaires. However, a significant bias was evident only among ICU patients, showing worse ratings from proxies for the WHODAS 2.0, IADL, and subsets of the SF-36. For the EQ-5D, bias appeared in both the ICU and non-ICU cohorts. The dichotomous analysis of the within-pairs-difference supported the findings, revealing a high proportion of pairs with differences outside the MCID (n (%)-SF-36 PCS normal ward: 47 (46%), ICU: 58 (57%); SF-36 MCS normal ward: 59 (58%), ICU: 62 (61%); WHODAS 2.0 normal ward: 58 (57%), ICU: 78 (77%); EQ-5D-5L normal ward: 40 (39%), ICU: 46 (45%); Barthel-Index normal ward: 22 (22%), ICU: 21 (21%)). Cohen's kappa indicated moderate reliability for the IADL. The reliability of proxy assessment with the instruments used was insufficient, exhibiting a significant bias in the pre-admission status of ICU patients; therefore, it should be applied with caution.

40390095,"RNA polymerase I is essential for driving the formation of 3D genome in early embryonic development in mouse, but not in human.",,Genome medicine,10.1186/s13073-025-01476-y,"Three-dimensional (3D) chromatin architecture undergoes dynamic reorganization during mammalian gametogenesis and early embryogenesis. While mouse studies have shown species-specific patterns as well as mechanisms underlying de novo organization, these remain poorly characterized in humans. Although RNA polymerases II and III have been shown to regulate chromatin structure, the potential role of RNA polymerase I (Pol I), which drives ribosomal RNA production, in shaping 3D genome organization during these developmental transitions has not been investigated. We employed a modified low-input in situ Hi-C approach to systematically compare 3D genome architecture dynamics from gametogenesis through early embryogenesis in human and mouse. Complementary Smart-seq2 for low-input transcriptomics, CUT&Tag for Pol I profiling, and Pol I functional inhibition assays were performed to elucidate the mechanisms governing chromatin organization. Our study revealed an extensive reorganization of the 3D genome from human oogenesis to early embryogenesis, displaying significant differences with the mouse, including dramatically attenuated topologically associating domains (TADs) at germinal vesicle (GV) stage oocytes. The 3D genome reconstruction timing is a fundamental difference between species. In human, reconstruction initiates at the 4-cell stage embryo in human, while in mouse, it commences at the 2-cell stage embryo. We discovered that Pol I is crucial for establishing the chromatin structures during mouse embryogenesis, but not in human embryos. Intriguingly, the absence of Pol I transcription weakens TAD structure in mouse female germline stem cells, whereas it fortifies it in human counterparts. These observed interspecies distinctions in chromatin organization dynamics provide novel insights into the evolutionary divergence of chromatin architecture regulation during early mammalian development. Our findings provide mechanistic insights into species-specific chromatin organization during germ cell and embryonic development and have potential implications for fertility preservation and birth defect prevention.",,,genetian@sjtu.edu.cn.
40390022,Spatiotemporal single-cell analysis elucidates the cellular and molecular dynamics of human cornea aging.,,Genome medicine,10.1186/s13073-025-01475-z,"The human cornea is a transparent and uniquely ordered optical-biological system. Precise coordination of its cellular mechanisms is essential to maintain its transparency and functionality. However, the spatial, cellular and molecular architecture of the human cornea and its intercellular interactions during aging have not been elucidated. We performed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and single-cell SpaTial Enhanced REsolution Omics-sequencing (scStereo-seq) analysis in corneal tissue from eight eyes of donors aged 33-88 years to elucidate the spatiotemporal cellular and molecular dynamics of human cornea aging. Immunofluorescence staining and Western blotting were performed to validate the findings. Spatiotemporal single-cell analysis revealed the complex cellular landscape, spatial organization and intercellular communication within the human cornea. The subpopulations of major cell types of the cornea were elucidated with precise spatial positions. In particular, we identified novel subpopulations, mapped the spatial positioning of limbal stem cells within the limbal niche, and delineated the interactions between major cell types. We observed that three basal cell subsets migrate centripetally from the peripheral to the central cornea with age, suggesting the ""spatiotemporal centripetal pattern"" as a novel paradigm for the age-related migration of corneal epithelial cells. Furthermore, we elucidated the age-related, region-specific molecular and functional characteristics of the corneal endothelium, demonstrating differential metabolic capacities and functional properties between the peripheral and central regions. As the first comprehensive spatiotemporal atlas, our work provides a valuable resource for understanding tissue homeostasis in the human cornea and advances research on corneal pathology, transplantation, senescence and regenerative medicine in the context of corneal aging.",,,yyduuu@163.com.
40389994,Exploring the link between Paradoxical leadership and nurses' career maturity: the mediating role of organizational learning.,,BMC nursing,10.1186/s12912-025-03179-6,"Paradoxical leadership, which strikes a balance between control and flexibility, is becoming more and more acknowledged as being essential for promoting nurses' career maturity, adaptation, and continuous development in today's complicated healthcare environments. Nevertheless, little is known about the processes that connect leadership traits to professional development, especially the part played by organizational learning. This study aimed to evaluate nurses' professional maturity and perceived paradoxical leadership, to investigate their relationship, and to determine the mediating role of organizational learning in this relationship. Following STROBE criteria, a descriptive cross-sectional design was employed. A descriptive cross-sectional study was carried out at a general hospital in Egypt with 380 nurses. Participants filled out the Organizational Learning Scale, the Career Maturity Questionnaire, and the Paradoxical Leadership Scale (PLS). Following STROBE principles, data were analyzed using ANOVA, Pearson correlation, and structural equation modeling (SEM). High degrees of organizational learning, professional maturity, and paradoxical leadership were noted by nurses. All of the factors showed significant positive relationships with one another. Both career maturity (β = 0.144, p = 0.004) and organizational learning (β = 0.136, p = 0.007) were directly impacted by paradoxical leadership. Additionally, organizational learning moderated the association between leadership and career maturity (indirect effect = 0.0245; total effect = 0.756) and had a direct influence on career maturity (β = 0.180, p < 0.001). An excellent fit was shown by the model fit indices (CFI = 1.000, IFI = 1.000, RMSEA = 0.073). Nurses' career maturity is greatly increased by paradoxical leadership, with organizational learning serving as a crucial mediating factor. Enhancing these elements through learning programs and leadership development can benefit nurses' career development and patient outcomes. Not relevant.",,,aml.diab@alexu.edu.eg.

Organizational citizenship behavior further enhances green management efforts. This study aimed to assess the effect of a green management training program on staff nurses' organizational citizenship behavior. Quasi-experimental design with a pretest-posttest approach. This study was carried out in Al-Ahrar Teaching. 85 staff nurses participated in the study. TOOLS OF DATA COLLECTION: green management knowledge questionnaire, employee green behaviors scale, and organizational citizenship behavior scale were used for data collection. Significant improvements were observed in staff nurses' knowledge of green management (16.5-89.4%), employee green behavior (5.9-64.7%), and organizational citizenship behavior (7.1-70.6%) at pre- and post- phases respectively. The green management training program effectively improved organizational citizenship behavior, supporting the research hypothesis. Not applicable.

40389936,Prevalence of anxiety symptoms in a Ugandan population sample and psychometric properties of the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 scale (GAD-7) in Luganda and Runyoro.,,BMC psychiatry,10.1186/s12888-025-06944-8,"Locally validated measures are required for robust clinical and epidemiological assessments of anxiety symptoms and disorders. Few studies on the African continent have examined the psychometric properties of the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 scale (GAD-7). We aimed to investigate certain psychometric properties of GAD-7 translated into Runyoro and Luganda, two Ugandan languages, and to measure the prevalence of anxiety symptoms in a Ugandan population sample. Data were collected in 2021-22 through the African Medical and Behavioural Sciences Organization (AMBSO) Population Health Surveillance (APHS), a population cohort study in Uganda. GAD-7, Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), and questions on socio-demographic factors were administered during individual face-to-face interviews. Construct validity, internal consistency, and concurrent validity of the Runyoro- and Luganda-translated GAD-7 were examined using confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), two internal consistency coefficients (Revelle's omega total and Cronbach's alpha), and Pearson's correlation coefficient, respectively. The prevalence of anxiety symptoms and likely anxiety disorders was also estimated. A total of 4107 individuals aged 13-80 participated, with 2206 and 1901 speaking Runyoro and Luganda, respectively. The Runyoro-translated GAD-7 retained its one-factor structure (RMSEA = 0.097, CFI = 0.977, TLI = 0.966), had good internal consistency (omega total = 0.85), and correlated moderately with the PHQ-9 (r = 0.67, p < 0.01). The Luganda-translated GAD-7 also fit a one-factor structure (RMSEA = 0.097, CFI = 0.989, TLI = 0.983), exhibited excellent internal consistency (omega total = 0.90), and strong concurrent validity with PHQ-9 (r = 0.71, p < 0.01). Overall, participants reported low levels of anxiety symptoms. Using GAD-7 ≥ 10 binary cut-offs, the total prevalence of likely anxiety disorders was 1.5% (0.5% among males, 2.2% among females). GAD-7 was translated into Runyoro and Luganda, two Ugandan languages, and both translations showed good psychometric properties. The prevalence of likely anxiety disorders was low in this diverse large Ugandan population sample, the largest population study on anxiety in Uganda to date. The low prevalence could partly be due to individuals with more severe anxiety symptoms not participating or GAD-7 not including local idioms of anxiety. Further clinical validation is required.",Bulamba R; Daama A; Kigozi G; Kigozi G; Mugamba S; Nalugoda F,Africa Medical and Behavioural Sciences Organization,leo.ziegel@ki.se.
40389873,Exploring barriers and facilitators to physical activity participation and food security among the Rohingya community living in Australia: a socio-ecological perspective.,,BMC public health,10.1186/s12889-025-22749-6,"Many Rohingya people from Myanmar have sought refuge and resettled in Australia due to persecution and genocide. Like many people from refugee and asylum seeker backgrounds who resettle in Australia, the Rohingya community face significant mental, physical and psychosocial challenges. Physical activity and nutrition are interrelated, modifiable risk factors associated with a range of health and psychosocial outcomes. Therefore, this study aimed to explore barriers and facilitators to physical activity and food security among the Rohingya community who have resettled in Sydney, Australia to inform intervention development. In-depth interviews and focus groups with Rohingya community leaders and members were conducted. Community leaders were identified as individuals from the same community who have lived experience of displacement and advocate for the community's needs. Reflexive thematic analysis and framework analysis were used to identify and then allocate themes to theoretically-driven domains according to the socio-ecological model. In total, sixteen participants were interviewed, including n=7 via one-one-one interviews and n=9 via a focus group. Of the 16 participants, five were community leaders. Ten themes for physical activity and twelve themes for food security were identified and mapped onto the socio-ecological model. The impact of insecure visa status was identified as a significant macro-level barrier affecting both physical activity and food security. Lack of culturally responsive services and increased barriers to physical activity for women due to cultural expectations and gender roles were also identified. However, increased opportunities to engage in healthy lifestyles in Australia compared to Myanmar, social support and physical and mental health benefits as motivating factors were discussed as key facilitators. Health promotion efforts targeting physical activity and food security require a multifactorial approach which prioritises cultural sensitivity, acknowledges gender roles and expectations, and considers past experiences including the impacts of migration.",Weber D; Le Compte E; Némorin S; Fatima R; Bahadurmia S,The New South Wales Service for the Treatment and Rehabilitation of Torture and Trauma Survivors; Australia Rohingya Women's Development Organisation (ARWDO); New South Wales Refugee Health Service,g.mckeon@unsw.edu.au.
40389842,A systematic review and thematic synthesis on the experiences of accessing and attending psychological therapy for informal carers of people living with dementia.,,BMC geriatrics,10.1186/s12877-025-05986-7,"Informal carers of people living with dementia are at a higher risk of experiencing mental health difficulties than the general population, yet many are not able to access timely psychological support and their psychological needs are often overlooked. It is therefore important to develop a greater understanding of carers' lived experiences in accessing and attending psychological therapy, to help tailor therapies to meet their individual needs. To our knowledge, this is the first thematic synthesis of qualitative literature on carers' experiences of accessing and taking part in psychological therapies. Three databases were systematically searched for qualitative literature, and 23 studies were included. Their quality was assessed and the data extracted was included in the thematic synthesis. Findings were organised into five overarching themes: i) Mental health and relationship difficulties (context); ii) Overall positive experiences of therapy (including specific techniques, therapist factors and therapeutic relationship, social support); iii) Common changes experienced (e.g. increased awareness of one's emotions and needs, increased self-care and self-compassion); iv) Unhelpful experiences of therapy, suggestions and further needs; and v) Impact of wider societal contexts and events. Given the predominantly positive experiences of therapy and mechanisms of change described, findings suggest that psychological therapies can be helpful for carers of people living with dementia. Additionally outlined are specific techniques to tailor therapy (regardless of approach) to best meet carers' needs, and suggestions for improvement. Future research should try to understand for whom and under what circumstances (e.g. wider contexts) psychosocial interventions become most effective in this population.",,,j.stott@ucl.ac.uk.

From January 2015 to December 2023, 35 patients with magnetic intraorbital foreign bodies, representing 35 affected eyes, were admitted to the Department of Ocular Trauma of Hebei Eye Hospital; these patients included 32 males and 3 females aged from 2 to 63 years (average: 36.97 ± 14.28 years). In the preoperative examinations and postoperative routine follow-ups, the basic conditions of the patients' eyes were ascertained through visual acuity examination using an international standard chart, slit‒lamp microscopic examination, anterior- and posterior-segment examinations with anterior slit‒lamp lenses, and intraocular pressure measurements. The foreign bodies were properly localized on axial and coronal CT scans. All patients had deep, orbital, magnetic foreign bodies and underwent extraction using a strong magnet. Among the 35 patients (35 eyes), the foreign body was successfully removed from 34 eyes, with a success rate of 97.1%. In one patient, the foreign body had been retained in the posterior location of the orbit for nearly 30 years, with organizational encapsulation, and was not removed, considering the risk of damaging the globe and optic nerves. None of the patients experienced postoperative complications, such as decreased visual acuity, excessive intraorbital haemorrhage, aggravated limitation of eye movement, or intraorbital infection. Foreign body removal using a strong magnet is the optimal surgical procedure for treating deep intraorbital metallic foreign bodies.",,,394121771@qq.com.

The effect of elexacaftor-tezacaftor-ivacaftor (ETI) on iron metabolism has rarely been reported. We aimed to study the trends and variables associated with iron store modulation under ETI. We conducted a prospective adult cohort in two referral centres for pwCF. Iron supplementation during the follow-up was an exclusion criterion. Clinical, biological data and pulmonary function tests were collected prospectively at ETI initiation (V0) and after 1 year of ETI (V12). The presence of Pseudomonas aeruginosa in forced sputum was assessed at V0 and V12. 220 (87 women) pwCF among the 278 screened were included. At V0, ID prevalence was 58% and was significantly associated with female sex and lower forced expiratory volume (FEV1). At V12, ID prevalence decreased significantly from 58 to 31% (p = 0.001). A significant decrease of C reactive protein and total globulins was found at V12. 60% of patients with ID at V0 achieved normalization of iron status at V12 with a significant association with the increase of FEV1 (moderate size effect: 0.68). A lower decrease of C reactive protein was significantly associated with the onset of ID in a small sample of patients (p < 0.001). The disappearance of Pseudomonas aeruginosa in sputum at V12 was not correlated to the evolution of iron status under ETI.

40389552,A cost-effective approach using generative AI and gamification to enhance biomedical treatment and real-time biosensor monitoring.,2025-05-19,Scientific reports,10.1038/s41598-025-01408-1,"Biosensors are crucial to the diagnosis process since they are designed to detect a specific biological analyte by changing from a biological entity into electrical signals that can be processed for further inspection and analysis. The method provides stability while evaluating cancer cell imaging and real-time angiogenesis monitoring, together with a robust, accurate, and successful identification. Nevertheless, there are several advantages to using nanomaterials in biological therapies like cancer therapy. In support of this strategy, gamification creates a new framework for therapeutic training that provides patients and first aid responders with immunological, photothermal, photodynamic, and chemo-like therapy. Multimedia systems, gamification, and generative artificial intelligence enable us to set up virtual training sessions. In these sessions, game-based training is being developed to help with skin cancer early detection and treatment. The study offers a new, cost-effective solution called GAI, which combines gamification and general awareness training in a virtual environment, to give employees and patients a hierarchy of first aid instruction. The goal of GAI is to evaluate a patient's performance at each stage. Nonetheless, the following is how the scaling conditions are defined: learners can be divided into three categories: passive, moderate, and active. Through the use of simulations, we argue that the proposed work's outcome is unique in that it provides learners with therapeutic training that is reliable, effective, efficient, and deliverable. The examination shows good changes in training feasibility, up to 22%, with chemo-like therapy being offered as learning opportunities.",,,abdullah.khan00763@gmail.com.

Cancer,10.1038/s41568-025-00819-6,"The transforming growth factor-β (TGFβ) paradox refers to the well-established role of TGFβ in suppressing cancer in healthy tissues yet promoting malignancy in established cancers. Although this positioned TGFβ inhibitors as a potential therapeutic strategy for malignancy, therapuetic blockade has failed in multiple clinical trials. The general lack of selection principles for defining which patients would most benefit from the addition of a TGFβ inhibitor has probably hindered its deployment. Here, we highlight the therapeutic potential in TGFβ regulation of DNA repair using human papillomavirus (HPV)-driven head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) as an illustrative example. HPV inhibits TGFβ signalling, which in turn reduces DNA damage repair, ultimately conferring sensitivity to cancer treatments and thus contributing to the favourable prognosis of HPV-positive HNSCC. Here, we review the DNA repair deficit caused by a loss of TGFβ signalling and how this could be targeted to induce synthetic lethality. Moreover, we explore its role in predicting response to immune checkpoint inhibitors and the potential of biomarkers to select which patients with cancer could ultimately benefit from TGFβ inhibition.",,,maryhelen.barcellos-hoff@ucsf.edu.

A hybrid model with a short-term decision tree, followed by a lifetime Markov model, was developed. The study considered patients aged 45-75 years old. Probabilities of visual disturbances and wearing glass were obtained from a clinical trial of trifocal IOL (NCT03280108). The analysis considered medical and glass costs. Utility values for each age were adopted from previous studies. The incremental QALY was mapped to the patient's willingness to pay (WTP) thresholds of gross domestic product per capita (GDP; $32,310), $23,000, and $15,000 per QALY gain to estimate the NMB. Trifocal IOL incurred higher costs but resulted in increased QALYs in all age groups. Under the WTP of $15,000, the NMB ranged from $694 at 75 to $6,880 at 45. The NMB with GDP was from $6,731 at 75 to $19,590 at 45. Using trifocal IOL can enhance the quality of life compared to no presbyopia correction with monofocal IOL in patients who want to correct presbyopia. Younger patients have greater economic benefits. Thus, trifocal IOLs are a worthy treatment option considering age and WTP.",,,sh.kwon@skku.edu.

Apart from disease and treatment characteristics, HRQoL is also influenced by sociodemographic variables. However, detailed evaluations of the impact of sociodemographic variables on HRQoL are scarce. Therefore, our study aims to (1) examine whether the magnitude of sex differences in HRQoL differs between cancer patients and the general population and (2) investigate if there is a sex-specific association between sociodemographic characteristics and cancer patients' HRQoL scores. For this retrospective, cross-sectional study, we relied on two datasets, with one providing HRQoL data from Austrian cancer patients (N = 574) and another containing normative data from the Austrian general population (N = 1002). HRQoL was assessed using the EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaire. Sex differences in HRQoL were observed in both cancer patients and the general population, with the magnitude of observed sex differences varying between the two groups in two EORTC QLQ-C30 scales, that is, statistically significant differences were found for Nausea/Vomiting (p = 0.009) and Sleep Disturbances (p = 0.042). Analyzing sex differences in cancer patients with regard to in the association of sociodemographic variables with EORTC QLQ-C30 scales, we found the strength of certain associations to be sex-specific, including associations of living situation with physical (p = 0.001), role (p = 0.004), and social functioning (p = 0.011). Our findings indicate that most sex differences in cancer patients' HRQoL reflect sex differences that also occur in the general population and are therefore, not cancer-specific, which is essential for the interpretation of cancer patients' HRQoL data. Sex-specific differences may also be, in part, associated with the sex-specific impact of sociodemographic variables on cancer patients' HRQoL. Detailed analyses of HRQoL data, including reference data from the general population, may allow for a better understanding of sex-specific treatment needs.",,,
40389371,An integrative review of new nurse practitioners' experiences in rural healthcare practice.,2025-05-19,Rural and remote health,10.22605/RRH9626,"A maldistributed primary care workforce and disparities in health outcomes are ongoing concerns for rural populations across the globe. Nurse practitioners (NPs) are a promising solution for mitigating rural healthcare inequities by reducing provider shortages and improving access to essential primary care services. The NP workforce is the fastest growing sector of primary care providers in the US. NPs are more likely than their physician colleagues to spend careers in rural and underserved settings practicing in isolation from other providers, with higher rates of turnover. An indistinct understanding of rural NPs' early career experiences highlights the need for a critical synthesis of the literature and key future recommendations. This integrative review aimed to analyze and synthesize various types of empirical reports and theoretical articles about new NPs' experiences in rural primary healthcare practice; identify current literature gaps; and discuss implications for education, policy, and further research. Whittemore and Knafl's integrative method was used to inform the selection, review, and analysis of the literature. Search keywords were based on the Population, Effect of Interest, Measure, Study Design, Setting framework: (1) population (primary care NPs), (2) effect of interest (early career phase in a rural context), (3) measure (NP perspectives about their experiences), (4) study design (empirical, theoretical), and (5) setting (rural US and countries with a similar healthcare system and NP workforce, such as Australia, Canada, Ireland, Netherlands, and New Zealand). Four key databases (PubMed, Embase, Web of Science and CINAHL) were searched, followed by manual searching of reference lists to identify relevant empirical and theoretical literature; no time delimitation was applied in the search. A total of 174 sources were scanned. Data were iteratively compared, and significant patterns were extracted and organized into thematic clusters. The literature search yielded five studies that met the eligibility criteria: three phenomenological studies, one descriptive qualitative study, and one descriptive quantitative study. Three themes emerged: the trajectory of early career practice for rural NPs, commitment and persistence of new rural NPs, and adaptive and maladaptive early career factors for rural NPs. This review included articles published in the US, although emergent themes may contribute to global knowledge about early career experiences in rural settings where advanced practice nurses are used. This review reinforced that NPs as a distinct professional population are underrepresented in rural workforce research, particularly during their early career phases. Scholarly literature about new rural NPs emphasized clinical preparedness and competence, workplace recruitment incentives, transition-to-practice experiences, and the importance of mentoring and professional networks. However, findings are limited primarily to the first year of practice. Future research priorities include exploring the ways to support rural NPs' wellbeing during the transition-to-practice phase, the barriers and facilitators to their job satisfaction by career stage, and factors contributing to burnout and turnover. Further exploration of community contexts and adaptive processes are indicated to inform meaningful NP educational refinements and effective retention policies. Understanding the experiences of rural NPs who are newcomers to rural life should also be explored.",,,

However, comprehensive perioperative medicine services are not yet uniformly available. This survey addressed the current state of perioperative medicine services for older surgical patients in the UK and ROI and how these services align with current national guidance. A survey was distributed electronically to all publicly administered UK and ROI hospitals performing surgical procedures. The survey examined perioperative care against national recommendations regarding service organisation and conduct. Of 339 eligible hospitals, 54.9% (186/339) responded. A hospital frailty lead was appointed in 54% (101/186) of hospitals, and 9% (16/186) had a designated anaesthetist for cognitive impairment. Hospital anaesthetic services outside the theatre were focused on preoperative assessment clinics (146/172), with few reporting routine postoperative involvement (17/166). Nurse-led preoperative assessments of frailty, cognition, and delirium risk were conducted in 49.5% (90/182), 44.3% (78/176), and 13.7% (24/175) of hospitals, respectively. The Clinical Frailty Scale was used in 87.0% (147/169) of hospitals for frailty screening. The 4 'A's Test (45.7% [85/186]) and Abbreviated Mental Test (43.0% [80/186]) were the preferred cognitive assessment tools. The survey highlights the variation in perioperative medicine services that exist for older surgical patients despite national guidelines advocating their widespread implementation. Opportunity exists to develop interspecialty perioperative services further and promote identification of frailty, cognitive impairment, and delirium, all of which negatively impact postoperative outcomes for older surgical patients.",,,Claire.swarbrick@nottingham.ac.uk.

Participants identified several barriers: (1) patient level, strong expectations for antibiotics post-procedure and concerns about procedure-site hygiene; (2) clinician level, fear of postoperative infections and litigation, lack of familiarity with updated guidance and doubts about applying international guidelines locally; (3) system level, hierarchical prescribing dynamics, referral communication gaps, high workloads and time pressures, and concerns over sterilisation practices. Facilitators included targeted professional training and regular guideline updates for urologists, development of local AP guidelines informed by local resistance data, enhanced patient education campaigns and active involvement of clinical pharmacists in preoperative antibiotic review and auditing. Urologists in Jordan face multifaceted barriers to AP guideline adherence. Future stewardship programmes can use insights from this study to develop locally tailored guidelines, targeted clinician training and pharmacist-led audits. Pilot testing with metrics such as prescribing rates, guideline concordance, antibiotic consumption and postoperative infection incidence will be essential to validate their impact before wider implementation.",,,m.abdeljalil01@ju.edu.jo.
40389316,Modelling diabetes and depression in Pakistan: using economic modelling to inform intervention design and a clinical trial of a behavioural activation intervention.,2025-05-19,BMJ open,10.1136/bmjopen-2024-092158,"The 'Developing and evaluating an adapted behavioural activation intervention for depression and diabetes in South Asia (DiaDeM)' trial investigates a psychological intervention, behavioural activation (BA), on people with both diabetes and depression in Bangladesh and Pakistan. This study aimed to aid the intervention and trial design. This was a modelling study using microsimulation to assess the intervention's cost-effectiveness. Diabetes was modelled using the UK Prospective Diabetes Study model based on Pakistani patients and depression was modelled using Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) trajectories allowing for multiple depressive episodes. It was assumed that diabetes-related adverse events increased depression recurrence, while depression impacted haemoglobin A1c, increasing diabetes-related events. The model estimated (1) maximum cost of BA which would be cost-effective (headroom analysis) to inform intervention design, and (2) value of reducing uncertainty around different measures (value of information analysis) to prioritise data collection in the DiaDeM study. Analysis was conducted from a Pakistani healthcare perspective over a lifetime with costs and outcomes discounted at 3%. BA plus usual care was compared against usual care. BA involved six sessions by a trained (non-mental health) facilitator. The usual care comparator was the prevailing mix of pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatments used in Pakistan. The primary outcome was disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs). Secondary outcomes included life years, healthcare costs and the rate of depression and diabetes-related events. Over their lifetime, individuals receiving BA plus usual care avoid 3.2 (95% credible interval: 2.7 to 3.8) years of mild depression and experience fewer diabetes-related events. BA plus usual care resulted in an additional 0.27 (0.03 to 0.52) life years, 0.98 (0.45 to 1.86) DALYs averted and had incremental healthcare costs of -US$97 (-US$517 to US$142), excluding BA costs. The maximum cost per BA course at which was cost-effective is US$83 (US$9 to US$214). Value of information analysis found the most important measures to include in the trial are the impact of depression on diabetes and PHQ-9 over time. This is the first model to jointly model depression and diabetes for South Asia and uses novel methods to reflect the diseases and inform intervention and trial design. This evidence has helped to inform the design of the DiaDeM intervention and the trial to evaluate it.

This was the secondary analysis in the Program Angiotensin-Neprilysin Inhibition in Admitted Patients with Worsening Heart Failure (PREMIER) study. AHF patients were allocated to switch to Sac/Val or ACEI/ARB, and Sac/Val group was divided into Sac/Val with or without uptitration group (Sac/Val >24/26 mg or ≤24/26 mg twice daily at week 8). The primary endpoint was the proportional change in geometric means of NT-proBNP levels at week 8. A total of 376 patients were included, consistent with the primary analysis in PREMIER. The percent changes in NT-pro BNP level were -51% (Sac/Val with uptitration), -39% (Sac/Val without uptitration), and -32% (ACEI/ARB), and their group ratio adjusted for baseline characteristics were 0.72 (Sac/Val with uptitration vs. ACEI/ARB, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.59 to 0.89; p=0.002) and 0.93 (Sac/Val without uptitration vs. ACEI/ARB, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.13; p=0.47). However, Sac/Val without uptitration group yielded a greater NT-proBNP reduction than ACEI/ARB group (adjusted ratio of change 0.72, 95% CI 0.55 to 0.94; p=0.016) in the subgroup of reduced ejection fraction. There were no adverse events associated with Sac/Val uptitration. Uptitration of Sac/Val therapy yielded a greater NT-proBNP level reduction in AHF patients, but Sac/Val therapy without uptitration also reduced NT-proBNP level in a subgroup with reduced ejection fraction compared with ACEI/ARB therapy.",,,tanakaa2@cc.saga-u.ac.jp.

We hypothesized that repetitive PE and inhibition of endogenous fibrinolysis would induce CTEPD with PH (CTEPH). Twenty-four Danish female slaughter pigs of ~60 kg (4 groups of 6 pigs) were included in the study. Pigs received either autologous PE (PE group), PE plus tranexamic acid (PE + TXA), repetitive PE (day 0, 3, 7, and 10) plus tranexamic acid (REP PE + TXA), or saline infusion (SHAM). Pigs were evaluated at baseline and on day 30 using computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA), invasive hemodynamics, and tissue samples. CTPA showed increased pulmonary obstruction score on day 30 in REP PE + TXA group compared to remaining groups (0 ± 0 SHAM vs 31 ± 21 PE vs 42 ± 12 PE + TXA vs 69 ± 17 % REP PE + TXA, P = 0.004). Mean pulmonary arterial pressure was higher in REP PE + TXA group on day 30 than remaining groups (12 ± 2 SHAM vs 13 ± 1 PE vs 12 ± 2 PE + TXA vs 16 ± 2 mmHg REP PE + TXA, P = 0.002) yet none of the groups developed PH and right ventricular function was normalized after 30 days. In histological samples, we found chronic thromboembolic lesions with organized fibrotic thrombi, revascularization, and neointima formation, but no microvascular remodeling. Autologous repetitive PE and inhibited fibrinolysis caused chronic thrombi without PH in a porcine model. Our findings suggest that a repetitive PE and impaired endogenous fibrinolysis alone are insufficient to develop CTEPH. This porcine model using autologous pulmonary emboli presents a realistic large animal model of chronic thromboembolic pulmonary disease particularly suitable to further investigate the vascular remodeling after acute PE. Future research should examine the role of inflammation, endothelial dysfunction and angiogenesis-driven clot resolution to improve understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms.",,,mek@clin.au.dk.

In this clinical focus article, we identify potential misconceptions related to MTSS and explore the degree to which these misconceptions may be prevalent and the driving factors that influence SLPs. We also discuss what next steps the field can take to support accurate beliefs about MTSS and refudiate potential misconceptions in order to best position SLPs to successfully participate in an MTSS framework. Twelve potential misconceptions related to MTSS and SLPs were identified by the authors of this clinical focus article. Nineteen school-based SLPs who worked in public schools in the United States participated in a 75-min focus group where they were asked to rate the degree to which they agreed or disagreed with the identified misconceptions and explain their reactions. Focus groups ranged in size from three to four SLPs. The focus groups produced both quantitative and qualitative data about SLPs' perspectives related to MTSS and provided insights into which misconceptions may be prevalent or influential in how SLPs frame, approach, and reflect on MTSS. Although roles and responsibilities of school-based SLPs support engagement with MTSS, there is growing concern regarding the gap between research, policy, and practice related to MTSS implementation. Identifying and addressing potential misconceptions SLPs hold related to MTSS will bolster efforts to support SLP involvement in MTSS, resulting in high-quality services and supports matched to strengths and needs of all students.",,,

To determine relative contributions of distinct vascular zones across different cortical depths in CBF regulation, we developed a simplified yet detailed and computationally efficient model of the mouse cerebrovasculature. The model integrates multiple simplifications and generalizations regarding vascular morphology, the hierarchical organization of mural cells, and potentiation/inhibition of MT in vessels. Our analysis showed that autoregulation is the result of the synergy between these factors, but achieving an optimal balance across all cortical depths and throughout the autoregulation range is a complex task. This complexity explains the non-uniformity observed experimentally in capillary blood flow at different cortical depths. In silico simulations of cerebral autoregulation support the idea that the cerebral vasculature does not maintain a plateau of blood flow throughout the autoregulatory range and consists of both flat and sloped phases. We learned that small-diameter vessels with large contractility, such as penetrating arterioles and precapillary arterioles, have major control over intravascular pressure at the entry points of capillaries and play a significant role in CBF regulation. However, temporal alterations in capillary diameter contribute moderately to cerebral autoregulation and minimally to functional hyperemia. In addition, hemodynamic analysis shows that while hemodynamics within capillaries remain relatively stable across all cortical depths throughout the entire autoregulation range, significant variability in hemodynamics can be observed within the first few branch orders of precapillary arterioles or transitional zone vessels. The computationally efficient cerebrovasculature model, proposed in this study, provides a novel framework for analyzing dynamics of the CBF regulation where hemodynamic and vasodynamic interactions are the foundation on which more sophisticated models can be developed.",,,

This study included randomized controlled trials comparing CBT-TF to an inactive or active comparison group for adults with PTSD. The primary and secondary outcomes were PTSD symptom severity and remission, respectively. Moderators included sociodemographic and clinical variables. Twelve studies compared CBT-TF with inactive (n = 625) and 11 with active comparison conditions (n = 706). The one-stage individual participant data meta-analysis found that CBT-TF was more effective than inactive comparison conditions (β = -0.78; OR = 2.34) and not significantly different from active comparison conditions (β = 0.02; OR = 0.53) in reducing PTSD symptom severity and achieving PTSD remission, respectively.

The perioperative management of these patients plays a crucial role in ensuring both optimal graft viability and favorable postoperative outcomes. Dexmedetomidine, a highly selective α2-adrenergic agonist, has attracted considerable attention for its potential renoprotective properties, which are attributed to its anti-inflammatory effects, suppression of sympathetic nervous activity, and ability to stabilize hemodynamics. This meta-analysis was undertaken to systematically integrate the current body of evidence regarding the impact of dexmedetomidine on perioperative renal function in recipients of allogeneic kidney transplants. A systematic and comprehensive search of the literature was conducted using multiple databases-PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, and the China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI)-up to March 2025. IEligible studies included those involving adult recipients of allogeneic kidney transplants, wherein dexmedetomidine was administered during the perioperative period, and renal function outcomes such as serum creatinine (Cr), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), urine output, or delayed graft function (DGF) were reported. Two reviewers independently extracted data to ensure objectivity and accuracy; disagreements were resolved by discussion. The pooled data were analyzed using a random-effects model. Statistical heterogeneity was quantified using the I Eleven studies comprising 1417 patients were included. Compared to controls, dexmedetomidine significantly reduced serum creatinine levels (SMD = - 0.75, 95% CI - 1.18 to - 0.32, p < 0.001; I The results of this meta-analysis support the renoprotective potential of dexmedetomidine when administered during the perioperative phase of allogeneic kidney transplantation. Its use is associated with improvements in key renal function markers, such as reductions in serum creatinine and BUN levels, as well as a decreased incidence of delayed graft function. The observed increase in urine output and shortened hospital stay additionally suggest broader perioperative benefits. Taken together, these findings underscore dexmedetomidine's promise as an adjunct pharmacologic agent in the perioperative care of kidney transplant recipients. Further validation through well-designed, large-scale randomized controlled trials remains essential to inform clinical guidelines.",,,hushanbiao@csu.edu.cn.

However, in Egypt, patient support groups remain undervalued and lack comprehensive visibility. This study aimed to address this gap by mapping patient online support groups in Egypt, categorizing them, and highlighting their importance in supporting patients and caregivers. The research includes examining online support groups and pages, particularly on Facebook. The results of our investigation indicate that 21% of the Facebook groups examined met the criteria for classification as qualified, another 21% were categorized as semi-qualified, while most of the groups, comprising 58%, were considered non-qualified. For the Facebook pages examined, organizational involvement through governmental, non-governmental, and charitable institutions qualified these pages as meeting the criteria for qualification. In contrast, the majority (70%) of the analyzed community pages were non-qualified, 30% were semi-qualified, and none met the criteria for qualification. This underscores the need for discernment when engaging with online resources. Furthermore, the study illuminates the role of various organizations, including hospitals, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and pharmaceutical companies, in supporting cancer patients, especially through online support groups.

NORSE is a rare disorder with high morbidity and mortality rates and limited evidence for effective therapies. We aimed to assess whether the gut microbiome of NORSE and status epilepticus (SE) differs from that of chronic epilepsy, whether NORSE differs from SE at different disease time points, and to examine the correlations between specific gut microbiota and cytokines in NORSE and SE. This longitudinal cohort study observed patients with NORSE (n = 15), SE (n = 17), and chronic epilepsy who were not in SE (n = 12). NORSE patients were recruited through the NORSE Consortium. Patients with NORSE and SE underwent longitudinal serial biospecimen collection. Fecal samples were subjected to whole-community shotgun metagenomics to characterize microbiome features. Cohorts were evaluated for prokaryotic, eukaryotic, and functional diversity. Correlations between blood inflammatory cytokine levels and microbiome features and covariate analysis with critical illness and clinical treatments were examined for NORSE and SE patients during and after SE resolution. During SE, NORSE and SE patients had significantly different prokaryotic, eukaryotic, and functional microbiome levels compared to chronic epilepsy patients without SE. Limited microbiome differences were observed within and between NORSE and SE, although these groups displayed differing correlation patterns between microbial species and cytokines. Patients who later died or were tube-fed harbored significantly different microbiomes than those who survived or were orally fed. NORSE and SE patients present with a more variable and dramatically different fecal microbiome than chronic epilepsy patients, which may indicate gut dysbiosis that may be reciprocally linked to inflammatory responses. Although NORSE and SE patients had similar microbiome structures, fungal and bacterial correlates with inflammatory cytokines differed between NORSE and SE, with confounding factors influencing microbiome structure. Our data suggest a microbiome-specific response to NORSE and SE, with implications for future treatment strategies.",,,

However, the study and intervention implementation were challenged by research-related factors, including ethical and clinical dilemmas, the burden of stakeholders holding multiple roles and general challenges associated with integrating research into non-academic health services. To optimise implementation and to bridge the access gaps particularly felt by rural families and health settings, translational studies ought to consider the enablers and challenges identified by the stakeholders.

40386993,Perceptions of Hospital Care Quality According to People Living With Multiple Long-Term Conditions: A Scoping Review.,2025-05-19,Health expectations : an international journal of public participation in health care and health policy,10.1111/hex.70297,"Delivering high-quality hospital care for people with multiple long-term conditions (MLTC), defined as the co-existence of two or more chronic health conditions, is important. However, evidence on care quality from the perspective of people living with MLTC has not been synthesised. The aim of this scoping review was to identify studies investigating how people living with MLTC perceive hospital care quality and to summarise key concepts and gaps in the evidence base. Systematic searches of five databases to identify all eligible studies published up until March 2024 were undertaken and supplemented by citation tracking. Peer-reviewed articles featuring people with MLTC's perceptions of the quality of 'usual' care in hospitals were eligible for inclusion. All records were screened independently by two reviewers. Of the 3178 titles and abstracts screened, 17 papers were eligible for inclusion (9 qualitative, 7 quantitative and 1 mixed-methods). Studies highlighted an unmet desire for holistic interdisciplinary care (n = 4), prioritisation of inpatients' acute conditions over long-term conditions (n = 2), barriers to patient engagement (n = 3) and insufficient discharge planning (n = 3). Existing studies that have investigated how people living with MLTC perceive the quality of their hospital care are diverse. However, all included studies point to ways in which hospital care for people with MLTC could be improved. The review highlights a need for studies including people of a wider range of ages, mixed-methods studies and studies that focus on under-researched elements of care quality, such as safety and preventative care. There have been regular opportunities for engagement with the ADMISSION research collaborative's Patient Advisory Group (PAG), a group of patients and carers with lived experience of multiple long-term conditions, who meet every 4 months. At these meetings, hospital care quality (and patients' perception thereof) has been a recurring theme, which encouraged the conceptualisation of this review. The PAG had no further direct involvement in the conduct of this review.",,,
40386883,"Data Missingness and Equity Implications in the Nation's Largest Student Fitness Surveillance System: The New York City School Based Physical Fitness Testing Programs, 2006-2020.",,The Journal of school health,10.1111/josh.70021,"Data missingness can bias interpretation and outcomes resulting from data use. We describe data missingness in the longest-standing US-based youth fitness surveillance system (2006/07-2019/20). This observational study uses the New York City FITNESSGRAM (NYCFG) database from 1,983,629 unique 4th-12th grade students (9,147,873 student-year observations) from 1756 schools. NYCFG tests for aerobic capacity, muscular strength, and endurance were administered annually. Mixed effects models determined the prevalence of missingness by demographics, and associations between demographics and missingness. Across years, 20.1% of students were missing data from all three tests (11.7% for elementary students, 15.6% middle, and 36.3% high). Missingness did not differ by sex, but differed significantly by race/ethnicity and student home neighborhood socioeconomic status. The nation's largest youth fitness surveillance system demonstrates the highest fitness data missingness among high school students, with more than 1/3 of students missing data. Non-Hispanic Black students and those with very poor home neighborhood SES, across all grade levels, have the highest odds of missing data. Strategies to better understand and ameliorate the causes of school-based fitness testing data missingness will increase overall data quality and begin to address health inequities in this critical metric of youth health.",,,

However, at the time this study was initiated, there had been no randomised controlled trials confirming or refuting this. To determine the clinical and cost-effectiveness of adding bisoprolol (maximal dose 5 mg once daily) to usual chronic obstructive pulmonary disease therapies in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease at high risk of exacerbation. A multicentre, pragmatic, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled clinical trial. Seventy-six United Kingdom primary and secondary care sites. People aged ≥ 40 years with a diagnosis of at least moderately severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with a history of at least two exacerbations in the previous year. Participants were randomised (1 : 1) to receive either bisoprolol or placebo for 1 year. During a 4- to 7-week titration period, the maximum tolerated dose was established (1.25 mg, 2.5 mg, 3.75 mg, 5 mg once daily). A number of participant-reported exacerbations during the 1-year treatment period. In total, 519 participants were recruited and randomised. Four post-randomisation exclusions left 259 in the bisoprolol group and 256 in the placebo group. Treatment groups were balanced at baseline: mean (standard deviation) age 68 (7.9) years; 53% men; mean (standard deviation) pack year smoking history 45 (25.2); mean (standard deviation) 3.5 (1.9) exacerbations in previous year. Primary outcome data were available for 99.8% of participants (bisoprolol 259, placebo 255). The mean (standard deviation) number of exacerbations was 2.03 (1.91) in the bisoprolol group and 2.01 (1.75) in the placebo group (adjusted incidence rate ratio 0.97, 95% confidence interval 0.84 to 1.13),  The study findings should be interpreted with caution as the target sample size of 1574 was not achieved because the funder considered the study to be unviable in the COVID-19 pandemic clinical research environment. Although 28% of participants did not initiate bisoprolol/placebo (1.6%) or ceased during the treatment period (26.2%), this is consistent with similar trials in the United Kingdom. In this underpowered study, the addition of bisoprolol to usual chronic obstructive pulmonary disease treatment did not reduce the likelihood of exacerbations, and bisoprolol cannot be recommended as a treatment for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. To incorporate definitive statements into appropriate clinical guidelines about the safety of bisoprolol for cardiovascular indications in people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. This trial is registered as ISRCTN10497306. This award was funded by the National Institute for Health and Care Research (NIHR) Health Technology Assessment programme (NIHR award ref: 15/130/20) and is published in full in  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is a lung disease causing shortness of breath. It has no cure and is a leading cause of death. It affects about 1.2 million people in the United Kingdom and costs the National Health Service around £1.9B each year. People with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease often have symptom ‘flare-ups’ (exacerbations) that usually need emergency treatment and impact the quality of life. Bisoprolol is usually used to treat cardiovascular diseases such as high blood pressure and heart failure. In observational research, people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease who take beta-blockers have been reported to have a reduced chance of having exacerbations. The bisoprolol in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease study tested whether adding bisoprolol to usual chronic obstructive pulmonary disease treatments reduced exacerbations in people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. A total of 515 people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease from 76 hospitals and general practitioner practices across the United Kingdom took part in the bisoprolol in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease study. They were randomly divided into two groups: one group (259 people) took bisoprolol pills every day and the other group (256 people) took dummy pills. People did not know which group they were in. We followed people for up to 12 months and counted how many exacerbations they had. In both groups, people had on average two exacerbations in 12 months. There was no difference between the groups – so bisoprolol did not reduce the number of exacerbations that people had. The bisoprolol group did not have any more serious adverse events or respiratory side effects than the placebo group. The COVID-19 pandemic had a major impact on the bisoprolol in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease study: we planned to recruit 1574 patients but were only able to recruit 515; so, the results have to be interpreted with some caution. Nevertheless, the results from the bisoprolol in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease study are important. Although bisoprolol did not reduce exacerbations and cannot be recommended as a treatment for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, bisoprolol was safe for patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. This important finding means that bisoprolol can be used to treat cardiovascular diseases in patients who have chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.",Choudhury G,Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh,

However, limited information is available on how their QoL changes, as most research has focused on older patients. To assess changes in QoL among YWBC, identify the most affected QoL domains, and identify the factors associated with these changes. Joven & Fuerte is a multicenter cohort of women aged ⩽40 in Mexico with newly diagnosed BC from 2014 to 2020. Participants completed the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Breast Cancer module QLQ-BR23 questionnaire at five different time points from enrollment until year 5 postdiagnosis. Clinical and treatment data were also collected. Group-based multivariate trajectory modeling was used to analyze longitudinal changes across QoL domains and classify patients into appropriate groups. Logistic models were then employed to identify associations between variables and group classification. A total of 477 women (median age: 36 years; interquartile range 32-38) were included.

Incidence, prevalence, death, years of life lost (YLL), years lived with disability (YLD), and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) were the burden measures that were assessed. All measures are reported as both all-age numbers and age-standardized rates (ASR) with 95% uncertainty intervals (UI). Decomposition analysis was conducted on CVD incidence. From 1990 to 2021, all-age CVD prevalence in Iran increased by 182.6% (2.9 to 8.3 million cases), with males consistently showing higher age-standardized prevalence rates (ASPR) than females (11,350 vs. 9,431 per 100,000 in 2021). ASPR remained stable nationally (9,956 to 10,386 per 100,000), peaking in adults ≥80 years. Incident cases rose by 159.6% (0.36 to 0.92 million), driven by population growth (49.5%) and aging (136.2%), while age-standardized incidence rates (ASIR) declined by 28.3% (1,337 to 1,197 per 100,000); with males (1,336) exhibiting higher rates than females (1,060) in 2021. All age deaths doubled (86,527 to 169,582) during this period, but age-standardized death rates (ASDR) decreased substantially by 42.97% (446 to 255 per 100,000). DALYs increased by 53.7% (2.4 to 3.7 million), though age-standardized DALY rates dropped 45.3% (9,096 to 4,977 per 100,000), dominated by ischemic heart disease (2,731 ASR) and stroke (1,229 ASR). High systolic blood pressure, dietary risks, and LDL cholesterol remained the leading contributors to DALYs nationwide. Iran's rising CVD burden demands prioritizing cardiac care infrastructure in underserved provinces like Golestan, enforcing sodium reduction policies aligned with Iran's existing trans-fat regulations, and integrating sex-specific programs such as tobacco control for males and community hypertension screening for women are critical. Multisectoral collaboration, including urban design promoting physical activity and subsidies for whole grains, must address provincial inequities exacerbated by Iran's aging population and dietary risks.",,,
40386241,Fitts' law-based identification of motor development stages for the upper limb: proof of concept in three age groups.,2025-05-19,PeerJ,10.7717/peerj.19433,"Psychomotor development, including fine motor skills, progresses throughout childhood and stabilizes in adulthood. This process is closely tied to neurological maturation, with ""reaching and pointing tasks"" considered fundamental upper limb functions. According to Fitts' law, movement time (MT) depends on the task's index of difficulty (ID). From an Information Theory perspective, throughput (TP) reflects processing speed in reaching tasks, while error rate (ER) quantifies incorrect selections. As motor control improves, TP is expected to increase and ER to decrease, indicating greater efficiency and coordination. This study aimed to compare TP and ER across three age groups to assess motor control evolution. Sixty participants were divided into three groups: children (5-6 years), adolescents (14-15 years), and adults (21-24 years). All participants performed a 2D reaching task on a tablet using their dominant hand, in accordance with the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 9241-411 standard. Each participant completed 23 trials under four IDs, varying target size and distance. TP and ER were calculated and the data were statistically analyzed using an analysis of variance (ANOVA) and  TP and ER showed significant differences across age groups. Children (5-6 years) had the lowest TP (3.84 ± 0.95 bits/s) and the highest ER (17.07 ± 8.15%). Adolescents (14-15 years) demonstrated higher TP (5.88 ± 0.64 bits/s) and lower ER (5.06 ± 3.13%), while adults (21-24 years) exhibited the highest TP (6.46 ± 1.05 bits/s) and a slightly higher ER (6.81 ± 5.07%) than adolescents. A one-way ANOVA confirmed a significant effect of age on TP (F The results indicate that TP and ER, derived from Fitts' law, effectively capture age-related differences in motor control across different developmental stages. These findings align with typical neuromotor development. Children show the lowest performance in both speed and accuracy, with adults outperforming both children and adolescents in processing speed, and adolescents demonstrating similar accuracy compared to adults. These metrics show potential for clinical and research applications, particularly in evaluating motor impairments or tracking rehabilitation progress in neurological conditions and advancing motor development research. Future studies should explore its use in clinical populations and across various age ranges to enhance assessment and intervention strategies.",Sanchez C; Urendes E; Aceves A; Martínez-Olagüe M; Raya R,Departamento de Tecnologías de la Información; Departamento de Fisioterapia,
40386093,TikTok's cardiopulmonary exercise testing videos: A content analysis of quality and misinformation.,,Digital health,10.1177/20552076251341090,"Cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) is conducted globally. On TikTok, CPET-related content serves as a key source of information for the public. However, the quality of these videos has not been systematically evaluated. This study aims to assess whether CPET videos on TikTok meet the informational needs of users. A cross-sectional analysis was performed on TikTok videos about CPET in China. Video sources were identified and analyzed. Content evaluation focused on CPET principles, indications, procedures, and indicator interpretation. The reliability and quality of the videos were assessed using four standardized tools: modified DISCERN, Global Quality Scale (GQS), JAMA benchmarks, and Patient Education Materials Assessment Tool for Audiovisual Materials (PEMAT-A/V). Misinformation was summarized, and the relationship between video quality and characteristics was examined. Of the video sources, 43.8% were from physicians, 12.5% from nonphysicians, 12.5% from general users, 14.5% from news agencies, 12.5% from nonprofit organizations, and 4.2% from for-profit organizations. Median scores for modified DISCERN, GQS, JAMA, PEMAT-A/V understandability, and actionability were 1.00, 1.00, 2.00, 33.00, and 29.00, respectively. Videos by physicians had significantly higher modified DISCERN and JAMA scores compared to those by nonphysicians ( The quality and reliability of CPET videos on TikTok are uncertain, with many containing significant misinformation. This problem largely stems from content creators' insufficient understanding of CPET. To address this, implementing standardized training and certification is necessary. Videos produced by physicians generally exhibit higher quality, highlighting the importance of strengthening their leadership in CPET teams. Furthermore, social media platforms should work with CPET providers and video creators to develop a certification system for medical information. These steps could improve video quality, reduce misinformation, and promote accurate CPET knowledge, ultimately benefiting public health.",,,

Currently, the standard treatments for TDH include minimally invasive surgical repair (MISR) and open surgical repair (OSR). MISR offers advantages such as reduced mortality, shorter hospital stays, and decreased postoperative pain and complications. In contrast, OSR is preferred for complex cases requiring better visualization, such as large defect repairs and comprehensive abdominal exploration. This study compares the clinical outcomes of MISR and OSR for TDH in adults, analyzing variables such as hospital stay, complications, recurrence rates, and postoperative pain. Following the 2020 Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses or PRISMA guidelines, this systematic review was conducted across six online databases (PubMed, Embase, Scopus, Cochrane, Web of Science, and Google Scholar), screening 1,894 studies. Six comparative studies were included in the final analysis, comprising 8,990 patients (7,735 MISR; 1,255 OSR). Postoperative pain was measured using the visual analog scale (0-10), while hospital stays and recurrence rates were extrapolated from patient charts and reported as percentages. The results indicate that MISR offers potential benefits, including shorter hospital stays and fewer complications. Additionally, reduction in respiratory failure and postoperative pneumonia suggests improved hospital course with the minimally invasive approach. Comparable recurrence rates between techniques demonstrate that MISR achieves technical success similar to OSR when appropriately selected, with fewer complications and shorter hospital stays. In conclusion, MISR for TDH resulted in shorter hospital stays with fewer complications and had recurrence rates similar to OSR. However, variability in outcome reporting limits the clinical applicability of these conclusions and calls for further standardized studies.",Valladares C,Internal Medicine,

The aim of this study was to evaluate the relationship between BRCA1 and BRCA2 gene mutations with PCOS and to determine the sociodemographic and clinical risk factors. This study seeks to analyze mutations in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes among women with PCOS in the Vijayapura region. In total, there were 96 individuals included (49 PCOS individuals and 47 healthy controls). Blood samples were collected for genetic analysis, and the anthropometry parameters, menstrual irregularities, and ultrasound findings were recorded. Genomic DNA was extracted to undergo polymerase chain reaction (PCR) followed by automated sequencing. Statistical analysis was performed using IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, Version 20.0 (Released 2011; IBM Corp., Armonk, New York, United States), with a significance level set at p<0.05. Outcomes presented an association between rural residency, educational status, and consanguineous marriage, as well as homemaker and PCOS (p=0.001 for all). Abnormal menstruation and dysmenorrhea (p=0.001) occurred frequently (69.4%) in women with PCOS (89.8% had acne). BRCA1 mutations exhibited a significant association with PCOS (p=0.045), where 8.2% of cases expressed the rs1555600862 (C>G variant, a likely benign missense mutation).  Conclusion: PCOS women often have a hormonal imbalance and ovarian dysfunction. Detecting BRCA gene mutations in women with PCOS is very crucial because these mutations are linked to higher risks of breast and ovarian cancers. Early detection of the BRCA gene mutation status can provide clear, valuable insight in terms of the prevention of complications and treatment options.",,,
40385919,The Role of Artificial Intelligence in the Prediction of Bariatric Surgery Complications: A Systematic Review.,,Cureus,10.7759/cureus.82461,"Obesity is a global health crisis, with bariatric surgery considered a highly effective intervention for sustained weight loss and resolution of associated health conditions. Despite its benefits, some patients experience postoperative complications, emphasizing the importance of accurate risk prediction. Traditional models often lack the capacity to manage complex clinical data. Artificial intelligence (AI) offers transformative potential for improving the prediction of surgical complications. This systematic review synthesizes existing research on AI's role in forecasting complications following bariatric surgery. The review followed PRISMA 2020 guidelines, with searches conducted across PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and IEEE Xplore for studies examining AI applications in this context. Seven retrospective cohort studies were included, and data were extracted on study design, AI algorithms, and outcomes. Risk of bias was assessed using PROBAST, and a narrative synthesis was conducted due to study heterogeneity. The included studies showed variability in AI model performance, with ensemble methods and neural networks generally performing better than traditional logistic regression. Reported area under the curve (AUC) values varied widely, with higher accuracy noted for predicting specific complications such as diabetes and leaks. Key challenges included overfitting, data imbalance, and limited generalizability, especially in deep learning models. Most studies were conducted in Sweden and the United States, utilizing large datasets that may introduce regional biases. Overall, AI shows promise in enhancing complication prediction in bariatric surgery, though methodological limitations highlight the need for prospective, multicenter validation. Future research should focus on addressing data imbalance, refining feature selection, and facilitating the clinical integration of AI through decision-support systems to improve patient care.",,,

Methods An observational, cross-sectional study was conducted over a 12-month period (January to December 2023) in the emergency department of Indira Gandhi Institute of Medical Sciences, Patna. A total of 200 patients aged 18 years and older with AECOPD were enrolled. Clinical, laboratory, radiographic, and electrocardiographic data were collected to calculate the prognostic scores. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality; the secondary outcome was the requirement for mechanical ventilation. Statistical analyses were performed using IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, Version 26.0 (Released 2019; IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA) and included logistic regression, receiver operating characteristic curve analysis, calibration assessment, and evaluation of seasonal variations in score performance. Results Among the five scoring systems, the DECAF score showed the highest predictive accuracy with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.80, followed by BAP65 (0.75), NEWS (0.72), CURB65 (0.70), and qSOFA (0.65). DECAF had the strongest association with hospital mortality (OR: 2.8, 95% CI: 1.7-4.5) and need for mechanical ventilation (OR: 2.3, 95% CI: 1.5-3.6). It also achieved the highest sensitivity (0.85) and specificity (0.75). ANOVA revealed significant differences in AUC values across scores (F = 4.76, p = 0.002). Calibration curves indicated accurate prediction for DECAF and BAP65. Seasonal analysis demonstrated consistent performance for both DECAF and BAP65 throughout the year. Conclusions The DECAF score was the most reliable predictor of hospital mortality and mechanical ventilation needs in AECOPD patients presenting to the emergency department. BAP65 also performed consistently well and may serve as a practical alternative, particularly in resource-limited settings. Condition-specific scores like DECAF should be favored over general severity indices for effective risk stratification in COPD.",,,

This research examined the long-term outcomes of anticoagulation therapy in AF patients, focusing on its benefits for stroke reduction, bleeding hazards, and survival rates. Researchers conducted an extensive literature search that combined PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Google Scholar to retrieve publications from 2015 to 2025. The search focused on keywords related to anticoagulation therapy and its connection to atrial fibrillation, stroke prevention, as well as both long-term outcomes and bleeding risks. The data extraction process was performed by two independent reviewers, while the assessment of study quality relied on the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale and the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool. The evaluation of evidence quality followed the GRADE approach. A total of 12 studies were included in this review after full screening. Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) exhibited either matching or superior stroke prevention performance compared to warfarin while showing lower major bleeding occurrence according to existing research findings. Studies demonstrated that patients receiving DOACs had longer survival rates when examining death rates. The review demonstrated that anticoagulation medication shows strong clinical results as a treatment strategy for prolonged atrial fibrillation cases. Further research must expand with prolonged follow-up examinations to establish data on the safety and effectiveness of DOACs compared to warfarin and to create better guidelines for the long-term anticoagulation treatment of AF patients.",,,

From 2014 to 2020 (pre-pandemic period), publication volume increased significantly by 28.7 studies/year (95% CI: 19.2-38.2, p < 0.001). In contrast, 2021-2023 (post-pandemic period) showed a non-significant decline of 13.0 studies/year (95% CI: -48.6-22.6, p = 0.405). Pre-pandemic trends showed significant growth in reviews, case-control/cohort studies, and surveys, while publication rates declined across most categories after 2020. Our findings illustrate an increase in research productivity among Canadian anesthesiology departments from 2014 to 2020, followed by a plateau in publication volume after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. This stagnation highlights a critical area for future exploration, including examining how pandemic-related factors, such as shifts in clinical priorities, resource allocation, and adoption of telemedicine in pre-operative clinics, have influenced research productivity. As the field of anesthesiology adapts to post-pandemic realities, ongoing bibliometric studies will be essential to monitor these trends and guide the trajectory of Canadian anesthesia research amid emerging clinical challenges and evolving academic priorities.",,,

This study aimed to explore subjective experiences and blood parameter changes of German followers of a carnivore diet. We conducted a statistical survey using a self-designed questionnaire and requesting blood panels. Inclusion criteria were: (i) following a carnivore-type diet for at least one month; (ii) completing the self-designed study questionnaire; and (iii) providing two sets of metabolic blood parameters from the period before and after adopting the carnivore diet. The survey was complemented by qualitative interviews with four subjects on a carnivore diet. Twenty-four individuals participated in the survey. Fifteen participants (62.5%) were male, and the median age was 46 (range 26-62) years. The majority ( Individuals adopting a carnivore diet do this mainly for health-related reasons and commonly experience subjective health improvements. Most blood parameters on the carnivore diet were within the reference ranges, and initially high HbA1c and triglyceride levels were reduced.

40385900,Association Between Dyslipidemia and Lichen Planus: A Cross-Sectional Study in a Tertiary Care Hospital.,,Cureus,10.7759/cureus.82401,"Background Lichen planus (LP) is an immune-mediated inflammatory disorder of the skin, mucous membranes, and nails. Several studies have reported a potential association between lichen planus and dyslipidemia, suggesting a possible link between this chronic inflammatory condition and metabolic disturbances. However, existing evidence has shown variable results across different populations. This study was conducted to further investigate the association between lichen planus and dyslipidemia. Methods A comparative cross-sectional study was conducted at Sri Ramachandra Institute of Higher Education and Research, Chennai, from August 2022 to August 2024. The study included 67 clinically diagnosed LP patients and 67 age- and sex-matched healthy controls. Detailed clinical examinations and fasting lipid profiles were performed. Statistical tools such as descriptive statistics, chi-square tests, and paired t-tests were applied. Results Patients with lichen planus (LP) exhibited statistically significant higher total cholesterol (p=0.001) and low-density lipoproteins (LDL) (p=0.001) levels compared to controls in both males and females. However, significantly elevated triglyceride levels were observed only in male LP patients (p=0.04). The high-density lipoproteins (HDL) (p=0.534) levels were similar between both groups. The prevalence of hypertension, diabetes, hypothyroidism, and cardiovascular disease was also higher in LP patients. Duration of illness was positively correlated with dyslipidemia prevalence. Conclusion LP patients exhibit higher lipid levels and comorbidities, highlighting the need for comprehensive management strategies such as routine lipid profile monitoring, early intervention, and lifestyle modification counselling, to mitigate the risk of dyslipidemia to address cardiovascular risk factors.",,,

It presents significant diagnostic challenges due to overlapping clinical features with SLE flares. This case report presents the diagnostic complexities of MAS in a 19-year-old female with SLE and lupus nephritis. She initially presented with persistent fever, cytopenias, hyperferritinemia, hypertriglyceridemia, and elevated inflammatory markers. Despite comprehensive evaluation, including a bone marrow biopsy that did not reveal hemophagocytosis, MAS was diagnosed based on clinical and laboratory findings. Initial treatment with high-dose intravenous steroids led to temporary improvement, but symptoms recurred upon tapering. Subsequently, the patient was treated with Anakinra, an interleukin-1 receptor antagonist, resulting in rapid clinical recovery and normalization of laboratory values. She remained on Anakinra for six months without experiencing a recurrence of MAS. This case underscores the diagnostic challenges of identifying MAS in patients with SLE and suggests that Anakinra may be an effective treatment option. It highlights the need for further research to refine management strategies for this potentially life-threatening condition.",,,
40385877,Prevalence of Rheumatoid Factor and Anti-citrullinated Protein Antibodies in Patients With Post-treatment Lyme Disease.,,Cureus,10.7759/cureus.82541,"Post-treatment Lyme disease (PTLD) occurs in a portion of patients after initial antibiotic treatment of Lyme disease (LD) and is often characterized by arthralgia without synovitis. Rheumatoid factor (RF) and anti-citrullinated protein antibodies (ACPA) are often used to assess joint pain in this setting; however, their clinical utility remains unknown. Our objective was to define the frequency of these autoantibodies in a large cohort of carefully characterized patients with PTLD meeting a research case definition and to determine the clinical implications of these tests. RF and ACPA were tested as indicated clinically and abstracted by chart review. The prevalence of antibodies and their relationship to symptoms were examined. Of the 167 patients included in the analysis, RF status was documented at least once for 78.4% (131 of 167), and ACPA status was available at least once for 88.0% (147 of 167). RF was positive in 3.8% (five of 131), and ACPA was positive in 4.8% (seven of 147) at least at one time point. A total of 7.2% (12 of 167) patients were found to have a positive RF or ACPA test at least at one time point. There was no difference in the proportion of patients with RF and/or ACPA based on the initial presenting manifestations of their LD, nor the symptoms of PTLD at later evaluation; however, the small sample size may limit our ability to detect these clinical differences. We found a low prevalence of RF and ACPA in this study, similar to the known rates in the general population. This reflects the lack of inflammatory arthritis in this population with clinically defined PTLD and arthralgia only.",,,
40385870,Reflections and Readiness of Medical Students for Self-Directed Learning (SDL): An Observational Cross-Sectional Study.,,Cureus,10.7759/cureus.82358,"Background/introduction Self-directed learning (SDL) is primarily an active learning technique that promotes higher-order cognitive skills and increases the self-efficacy of students. Through SDL, the onus of learning primarily lies with the students. Medical students need to be lifelong learners, as it is crucial to update their knowledge and apply the same in clinical practice. SDL plays a vital role in inculcating the habit of reading and learning in medical graduates. It also helps in developing all the domains of learning, such as cognitive, psychomotor, and affective. Materials and methods In this observational, questionnaire-based, cross-sectional study, a total of 208 first- and third-year medical students (104 students in each batch) were asked to fill out a pre-validated questionnaire form to record the reflections and readiness of the students regarding SDL in medical education. The participants were asked to select from a Likert scale of ""strongly disagree,"" ""disagree,"" ""neutral,"" ""agree,"" and ""strongly agree."" An open-ended questionnaire was used to record the views and reflections of students about the concept of SDL in medical education. Results were tabulated on an Excel sheet (Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, Washington), and descriptive statistical measures such as means and percentages were used for analysis of the data. Results Approximately 90 (86.53%) of third-year professional students responded positively to SDL readiness, whereas it was approximately 80 (76.92%) among first-year professional students. The majority of students, 198 (95.19%), revealed that the biggest challenges for the successful implementation of active learning through SDL are time constraints and the need for extensive planning and research skills. Conclusions Our study concluded that, overall, the third-year professional students showed higher reported readiness for learning the concepts through SDL in all three domains, such as motivation for learning, planning and implementation, and interpersonal communication skills.",,,
40385865,Prevalence and Clinical Correlation of Intron 22 Inversion in Hemophilia A in Northeast India.,,Cureus,10.7759/cureus.82365,"Hemophilia A is an X-linked bleeding disorder caused by mutations in the F8 gene, with intron 22 inversion being the most common genetic alteration in severe cases. This study aimed to determine the prevalence of intron 22 inversion in hemophilia A patients in Assam, Northeast India, and evaluate its correlation with disease severity. This hospital-based observational study included 80 hemophilia A patients at Assam Medical College from March 2023 to February 2024. Clinical history, coagulation tests (activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), prothrombin time (PT), and factor VIII assay), and nested long-distance polymerase chain reaction (NLD-PCR) for intron 22 inversion detection were performed. Statistical analysis was conducted using SPSS v25 (IBM Corp., Armonk, New York, USA). Among the 80 patients, 41 (51.25%) had severe hemophilia A, 22 (27.5%) moderate, and 17 (21.25%) mild. Intron 22 inversion was detected in 24 patients (30%), with a significantly higher prevalence in severe cases 22/41 (53.65%) compared to moderate 2/22 (9.09%) and mild cases (0%) (p < 0.001). APTT was significantly prolonged in severe cases (109.35 ± 15.62 sec) compared to moderate (86.92 ± 9.87 sec) and mild cases (61.71 ± 8.94 sec) (p < 0.001), reinforcing the genetic basis of disease severity. This study confirms a strong correlation between intron 22 inversion and severe hemophilia A, consistent with global and Indian studies. It emphasizes the need for routine genetic screening for early diagnosis and personalized treatment strategies, including genetic counseling.

This case is noteworthy due to its rarity, the diagnostic challenges it presents, and its therapeutic implications for patients undergoing stapled hemorrhoidopexy. Reporting this case aims to raise awareness among clinicians about this uncommon complication and contribute to the understanding of its clinical management. A 60-year-old woman underwent the Longo procedure in 2021 for symptomatic Grade III hemorrhoidal disease and rectocele. The initial surgery was successful, with no immediate postoperative complications. However, four years later, she presented with rectal discomfort but no other significant symptoms. Diagnostic evaluation, including colonoscopy and rectal ultrasonography, revealed a large diverticulum at the site of the previous stapled anastomosis, at five o'clock position. Surgical intervention was planned, involving resection of the diverticulum and primary repair of the rectal wall. Histopathological examination confirmed the presence of a true diverticulum involving all layers of the rectal wall. The patient recovered well postoperatively, with resolution of symptoms and no further complications at follow-up. This case highlights rectal diverticulum as a rare but significant late complication of the Longo procedure. It underscores the importance of considering this entity in patients with persistent or recurrent symptoms after stapled hemorrhoidopexy. Long-term follow-up and a high index of suspicion are essential for timely diagnosis and management.

However, evidence on its efficacy and safety in people without diabetes remains limited. The aim of this review is to analyse the efficacy of liraglutide in non-diabetic obese or overweight adults by systematically reviewing and meta-analyzing clinical trials. A systematic peer review was performed according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) protocol using PubMed/MEDLINE, Scopus, and Web of Science databases. Meta-analysis was performed using a random effects model in Review Manager 5.7.0 (The Cochrane Collaboration, Oxford, UK).

40385820,Artificial Intelligence as a Screening Tool for MRI Evaluation of Normal and Abnormal Medial Meniscus.,,Cureus,10.7759/cureus.82523,"Background The meniscus is a crucial structure in the knee joint, and its abnormalities are best detected using MRI. However, manual interpretation of MRI scans is time-consuming and prone to inter-observer variability. With advancements in artificial intelligence (AI), deep learning models offer a promising approach to automate evaluation, improving diagnostic accuracy and efficiency. Objective This study evaluates the performance of a deep learning-based Mask R-CNN model for the segmentation and classification of the medial meniscus in MRI scans. Unlike prior studies that used bounding box-based segmentation of knee structures, our model utilizes precise polygonal annotations to ensure pixel-wise segmentation limited to the meniscus, allowing accurate abnormality detection. Methods We used a dataset of 3,600 sagittal proton density-weighted fat-suppressed (PD-FS) MRI images. The meniscus was manually annotated using the VGG Image Annotator (VIA) tool, focusing on accurate delineation of the meniscus while excluding adjacent anatomical structures. The Mask R-CNN model, with a ResNet-50 backbone and feature pyramid network (FPN), was trained for 50 epochs using a structured dataset. We evaluated performance using metrics such as area under the curve (AUC), segmentation accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity. Results The model demonstrated high performance in distinguishing normal and abnormal menisci. It achieved an AUC of 0.992 for normal menisci and 0.963 for abnormal menisci. Segmentation results confirmed precise meniscus delineation, validating the exclusion of non-meniscal regions and improving classification accuracy. Training and validation loss trends showed effective learning without overfitting, supporting the model's generalization capability. Conclusion The Mask R-CNN model provides an accurate AI-assisted tool for segmenting and classifying MRI scans. By using pixel-wise segmentation rather than bounding boxes, our approach minimizes the inclusion of surrounding structures, ensuring more refined and clinically relevant abnormality detection. Focusing solely on the meniscus enables targeted abnormality detection while reducing the radiologists' workload. Future work will focus on multi-center dataset validation and expanding the model to sub-classify meniscal abnormalities for enhanced clinical applicability.",,,
40385819,Comparative Effectiveness and Safety of Oral Versus Subcutaneous Semaglutide in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,,Cureus,10.7759/cureus.82497,"Semaglutide, a glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist, has emerged as an important therapeutic option for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), available in both oral and subcutaneous formulations. While subcutaneous semaglutide has been available since 2017, oral semaglutide (approved in 2019) represents the first oral GLP-1 receptor agonist. This meta-analysis compared the efficacy and safety of oral versus subcutaneous semaglutide in patients with T2DM. We conducted a systematic literature search across PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science from inception to March 15, 2025. Four studies (one randomized controlled trial and three retrospective studies) with a total of 559 patients (257 receiving oral and 302 receiving subcutaneous semaglutide) met our inclusion criteria. The included studies were published from 2017 to 2024. All studies had a six-month follow-up duration. Outcomes included changes in HbA1c, body weight, and treatment discontinuation due to adverse effects. Pooled analysis indicated that subcutaneous semaglutide achieved significantly greater reductions in HbA1c compared to oral semaglutide (SMD: 0.21, 95% CI: 0.04 to 0.38) with low heterogeneity (I-square: 22%). For body weight reduction, subcutaneous semaglutide showed greater effectiveness, though the difference was not statistically significant (SMD: 0.12, 95% CI: -0.27 to 0.52) with high heterogeneity (I-square: 81%). Notably, patients receiving oral semaglutide had a significantly higher risk of treatment discontinuation due to side effects (RR: 1.79, 95% CI: 1.13 to 2.83) with no heterogeneity (I-square: 0%). While both formulations demonstrated clinical benefits, subcutaneous semaglutide appears to offer superior glycemic control with fewer treatment-limiting adverse effects. These findings likely reflect the differences in bioavailability and pharmacokinetics between the two formulations. However, the choice between formulations should consider individual patient factors, including treatment adherence, preference for injection versus oral administration, and specific comorbidities. Future studies should investigate whether modified dosing protocols could improve the tolerability of oral semaglutide while maintaining efficacy.",Aqel YH; Wei CR,Research and Development; Medicine,
40385817,Microdebrider-Assisted Turbinoplasty Versus the Coblation Method of Turbinoplasty: A Comparative Study.,,Cureus,10.7759/cureus.82422,"Background Inferior turbinate hypertrophy is a major cause of chronic nasal obstruction, significantly impairing nasal airflow and overall quality of life. Although medical management with antihistamines, decongestants, and corticosteroids is the first line of treatment, a subset of patients remains symptomatic and requires surgical intervention. Various surgical techniques, like mucosal sparing and non-mucosal sparing techniques, have become available recently. Microdebrider-assisted turbinoplasty (MAT) and coblation-assisted turbinoplasty (CAT) are two widely used mucosa-sparing techniques. However, limited comparative studies exist evaluating their efficacy, safety, and long-term outcomes. This study aims to compare the clinical outcomes of MAT and CAT in the surgical management of inferior turbinate hypertrophy. Methods This prospective comparative study included 60 patients diagnosed with symptomatic inferior turbinate hypertrophy unresponsive to medical therapy. Patients were assigned to undergo either MAT (n=30) or CAT (n=30) under general anesthesia using a lottery system. While the CAT group underwent controlled radiofrequency ablation with a coblator wand prior to outfracturing the turbinate, the MAT group underwent submucosal tissue removal and turbinate lateralization using a microdebrider. Postoperative outcomes were assessed using the Nasal Obstruction Symptom Evaluation (NOSE) score and objective airflow measurements at the seventh day, second, and third months following surgery. Additionally evaluated were intraoperative time, bleeding, complications, and postoperative healing. Results Both MAT and CAT showed significant improvements in NOSE scores, with mean scores improving from 72.4 ± 8.6 preoperatively to 18.7 ± 4.2 at three months in the MAT group and from 73.1 ± 7.9 to 19.3 ± 5.1 in the CAT group; however, there is no statistical difference between the two procedures in terms of symptomatic relief (p > 0.05). Peak nasal inspiratory flow (PNIF) improved by 62.3% in the MAT group and 58.7% in the CAT group at three months (p > 0.05). Intraoperative blood loss was slightly lower in the CAT group (21.5 ± 5.2 mL vs. 27.8 ± 6.4 mL in MAT, p < 0.05). Postoperative crusting and healing times were comparable between the two groups, with no significant difference in complication rates or recurrence of turbinate hypertrophy. Conclusion MAT and CAT are both effective and safe surgical options for managing inferior turbinate hypertrophy. While CAT offers a slight advantage in intraoperative hemostasis, both techniques provide comparable symptom relief, nasal airflow improvement, and mucosal preservation, making either a viable choice based on surgeon preference and patient-specific factors.",,,

It is essential to ensure that the contents of the diary are related to the degree of goal attainment and simplify its format prior to clinical application. This foundational study aimed to investigate the relationship between the contents of a goal-setting diary and goal attainment. The participants were 252 healthy occupational therapy students (OTS) aged 18 years or older from three training institutions (a university, a junior college, and a vocational school). Students with diseases that are being treated were excluded. Multiple regression analysis (stepwise method) was performed, with goal attainment as the dependent variable. Quantitative data from the goal-setting diary, including the number of strategies, importance, satisfaction, confidence to continue, difficulty, persistence, self-efficacy, and effort, along with the participant's basic attributes, were used as explanatory variables.

40385789,A Questionnaire Study on Patient Perspectives of Sedation for Ophthalmic Procedures.,,Cureus,10.7759/cureus.82385,"Introduction Ophthalmic procedures, such as cataract and refractive surgery, are prevalent in the United States and are often associated with significant preoperative anxiety among patients, which can impact patient comfort and surgical outcomes. Sedation is used in the vast majority of these procedures to reduce anxiety and improve patient cooperation. However, there is limited information on patient-reported experiences and perspectives. This study thus aimed to explore the opinions of patients on sedation for their eye procedures. Methods We administered an anonymous Qualtrics survey to gather data such as patient anxiety levels before and after sedation, patient satisfaction, potential side effects from sedatives, and perceived need for sedation in future procedures. The survey was posted in ophthalmology surgery clinics and online. Results Analysis of our filtered data found that the preoperative anxiety of patients significantly decreased after receiving sedation, with almost all participants in our survey recommending sedation for ophthalmic procedures to others. Many respondents suggested that resources such as question and answer (Q&A) sessions with ophthalmologists or literature would alleviate concerns about receiving sedation. Although a few mild side effects were self-reported from sedation, a majority of participants did not experience any side effects, and no severe side effects were noted. Conclusion These findings suggest that sedation for ophthalmic procedures is successful in reducing patient preoperative anxiety with minimal side effects. However, further research with larger, more diverse populations is warranted to confirm these results and guide future practices in patient care for ophthalmic surgeries.",Gannon W,Ophthalmology,

Podcasts offer a flexible educational resource for students, allowing students to listen to content on their own time. There has been an increase in the use of podcasts for medical education and evidence that it may boost academic performance, but there are few resources available for teaching the soft skills of medicine, such as time management, adaptability, and problem solving. To address this gap, four faculty members at Edward Via College of Osteopathic Medicine (Virginia Campus) developed a podcast series with four short (10-15 minute) episodes covering non-clinical skills, including time management, clinical rotation tips, test-taking strategies, and the transition to clinical years. Students were invited via email to voluntarily complete anonymous pre- and post-intervention surveys using a Likert scale to assess their confidence and preparedness. Since Likert-scale data is ordinal and non-parametric, and as survey responses were not matched by participant, a Mann-Whitney U test was used to analyze differences between pre- and post-intervention responses. The number of participants ranged from 6 to 12 per episode. Preliminary data showed an overall increase in average scores, rising from 3.12 to 3.67 on a 1-5 scale, with statistically significant improvements in the episodes on the transition to clinical years and time management (p < 0.05). These findings suggest that podcasts may serve as a valuable supplemental tool in medical education, though further research with larger sample sizes is needed.",,,

A hospital-based, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial was conducted from September to December 2022, registered with the Clinical Trial Registry of India (CTRI/2022/09/046070). A total of 94 children with severe pneumonia were randomly assigned to receive either 10 mg of zinc gluconate (2.5 ml) or a placebo twice daily during hospitalization, along with standard therapy. Clinical signs, symptoms, and laboratory parameters were monitored, and baseline characteristics were compared between the groups. The median duration of cough and cold in the Zinc group was significantly shorter compared to the Control group (p = 0.013, p = 0.005, respectively). Among stunted children, those in the Zinc group required about 3.12 fewer days for recovery compared to those in the Control group, and this difference was statistically significant (p = 0.05). However, no statistically significant differences were observed between the groups in the duration of tachypnea, hypoxia, chest indrawing, inability to feed, lethargy, severe illness, or overall hospitalization. While zinc supplementation demonstrated potential benefits such as reduced hospital stay and faster symptom resolution, these differences were not statistically significant. Further research is needed to validate zinc role in improving clinical outcomes in severe pediatric pneumonia.",,,

The lateral intercostal artery perforator (LICAP) flap, a muscle-sparing technique, is a procedure that utilizes excess soft tissue below the armpit to fill the cavity remaining after a lumpectomy for tumors located in the outer quadrant of the breast. We present an exemplary case of a 45-year-old female who underwent O-BCS for multifocal invasive ductal carcinoma, followed by reconstruction with the LICAP flap. The patient exhibited exceptional aesthetic outcomes following the LICAP flap procedure, preserving a natural breast contour while achieving clear surgical margins and eliminating residual cancer tissue. The efficacy and versatility of the LICAP flap technique qualify it as an effective approach that addresses the reconstructive aspects of oncoplastic breast surgery, while also achieving a successful oncological response.",Almarzooqi S,Department of Otolaryngology - Head and Neck Surgery,
40385769,Comprehension of PTEN-Regulated MicroRNA Profiling in Oral Premalignant Lesions: A Critical Link to Early Detection of Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma.,,Cureus,10.7759/cureus.82343,"Oral premalignant lesions represent the most prevalent lesions observed within the oral cavity. These lesions generally remain asymptomatic until they advance to more severe stages, at which point their progression to oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) becomes evident. Addressing this transformation necessitates further investigative efforts. The PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homolog) gene functions as a crucial tumor suppressor, with its expression regulated by a variety of complex mechanisms, including transcriptional, post-transcriptional, and post-translational processes. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are significant modulators of PTEN expression and play an integral role in the transition from oral premalignant lesions to OSCC. This review evaluates the impact of miRNA dysregulation on PTEN and examines the continuum model of tumor suppression. It posits that the loss of PTEN functionality may transpire without alterations to the DNA sequence, particularly through mechanisms associated with miRNA regulation. Furthermore, this discourse elucidates the structural interactions between PTEN and miRNAs, particularly in the context of oral premalignant lesions, which may influence the rate of transformation to OSCC. Such insights are crucial for informing treatment strategies. The review also explores the potential of targeting specific miRNAs to restore PTEN functionality, intending to improve clinical outcomes for patients diagnosed with OSCC. By elucidating these regulatory interactions, this analysis aims to identify pathways conducive to the development of targeted therapeutic strategies.",,,

Romania was also severely affected, with Suceava County being dubbed the ""Romanian Lombardy"" due to its high infection rates. In response, Romanian researchers actively contributed to scientific literature on COVID-19, producing numerous publications addressing epidemiology, public health policies, and medical treatments. This study aims to analyze Romanian scientific contributions related to COVID-19 using bibliometric methods. A bibliometric analysis was conducted using Web of Science, focusing on publications from Romanian universities, hospitals, and medical organizations. Articles were selected based on relevance to medicine, while non-research publications such as editorials and book reviews were excluded. The study employed VOSviewer (available at https://www.vosviewer.com/) for co-authorship and keyword analysis, alongside CiteSpace (available at https://citespace.podia.com/) for citation burst analysis. Between January 2019 and March 2025, 4,720 COVID-19-related articles with at least one Romanian author were indexed in Web of Science. After applying the inclusion criteria, 336 articles remained. The most productive authors were from Dunărea de Jos University, Galați, and the University of Oradea. Most studies were published in MDPI journals, with predominant research areas including internal medicine, pharmacology, and experimental medicine. Keyword analysis highlighted major research themes such as COVID-19 impact, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), and pandemic response. Romanian research significantly influenced public health policies, guiding pandemic management strategies. The crisis accelerated digital healthcare adoption, including telemedicine services. Biomarkers such as C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) were identified as predictors of COVID-19 severity. Additionally, the pandemic had severe psychological and social consequences, particularly among vulnerable populations. This bibliometric analysis underscores the substantial role of Romanian researchers in the global fight against COVID-19 and the lasting impact of their contributions. Understanding Romania's scientific contribution to COVID-19 literature helps assess the country's research impact, identify strengths in key areas, and highlight opportunities for international collaboration in pandemic-related studies.",,,
40385741,"Comparison of the Effects of Left, Right, and Bilateral Carotid Baroreceptor Stimulation on Autonomic and Hemodynamic Responses Using an Indigenously Developed Paired Neck Chamber Device.",,Cureus,10.7759/cureus.82470,"Introduction Baroreflex function plays a critical role in cardiovascular regulation, with carotid baroreceptors exerting a significant influence on autonomic and hemodynamic responses. While prior studies have suggested functional asymmetry between the left and right carotid baroreceptors, the findings remain inconsistent. These inconsistencies stem from several limitations, including small sample sizes, reliance on animal models, and inadequate consideration of confounding factors such as respiratory influence and baseline autonomic tone. A major barrier to conducting well-controlled human studies is the lack of non-invasive methods capable of delivering precise, side-specific baroreceptor stimulation. To address these gaps, we introduce a novel, non-invasive, digitally controlled paired neck chamber device that enables accurate, graded unilateral and bilateral stimulation using both negative and positive pressure, thereby overcoming several limitations of earlier techniques. The objective of this study is to evaluate the autonomic responses (RR interval (RRI) and heart rate) and hemodynamic responses (systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP)) to left, right, and bilateral carotid baroreceptor stimulation using graded negative and positive pressure stimuli. The study also seeks to evaluate baroreflex sensitivity (BRS) and the dose-response relationships under various stimulation conditions. Methods We conducted a prospective interventional study at All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) Nagpur in collaboration with the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Jodhpur, involving 108 healthy young adults (57 males and 51 females). Participants had a neck ultrasound to find the carotid sinus, and then they were exposed to controlled pressure changes (from -100 mmHg to +100 mmHg) on the left, right, or both carotid sinuses. ECG and continuous blood pressure monitoring were used to evaluate autonomic and hemodynamic responses. Repeated measures using ANOVA analyzed variations in autonomic and hemodynamic responses among different stimulation sites. Nonlinear regression was employed to model dose-response relationships, while Friedman and Wilcoxon signed-rank tests were utilized to compare BRS gain. Multiple linear regression analyzed the relationships between BRS and markers of autonomic tone. Results Bilateral stimulation elicited the strongest bradycardic response (RRI up to 0.41 s) and more stable tachycardia under positive pressure compared to unilateral stimulation. Left-sided stimulation had a greater cardiac effect, while right-sided stimulation showed stronger blood pressure modulation (SBP and DBP fall up to 24.35 mmHg and 15.78 mmHg). BRS did not differ significantly across conditions, and the non-additive bilateral response suggests central integration. Conclusions This study provides new insights into carotid baroreceptor asymmetry, demonstrating that bilateral stimulation enhances autonomic modulation, while unilateral stimulation exhibits differential cardiac and blood pressure effects. These findings have clinical implications for baroreflex activation therapy (BAT) in conditions such as hypertension and heart failure. Future research can explore long-term adaptations, neuroplasticity, and central baroreflex processing to refine therapeutic strategies.",,,

This study aims to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of atezolizumab for the treatment of NSCLC from the perspective of payers in both developed and developing countries. A Markov model was developed to simulate treatment scenarios involving atezolizumab or chemotherapy for patients diagnosed with NSCLC. The model estimated the transition probabilities, health care costs, and health utilities base on the risk of disease progression, survival, and toxicity using data from IPSOS clinical trials, relevant literature, and publicly available databases. A price simulation was conducted to guide the pricing strategy at the specified willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold, and sensitivity analyses were performed to assess the model's response to uncertainty. Among patients with NSCLC who are not suitable for treatment with a platinum-containing regimen, the use of atezolizumab led to an incremental gain of 0.35 quality adjusted life years (QALYs) compared to chemotherapy. The ICER for atezolizumab compared to chemotherapy was calculated at $220400.53 per QALY in the US and $101874.61 per QALY in China. The price simulation results indicated that atezolizumab was favored in the US when the price was less than $371.28/60 mg and $474.92/60 mg at the WTP thresholds of $100,000 and $150,000, respectively; it was cost-effective at a WTP threshold of $36023.71when the price was about 40% of the current price in China. Sensitivity analysis revealed that variables such as the price of atezolizumab and utilities influenced the r model's outcomes, although these factors did not significantly alter the overall conclusion. Atezolizumab was not considered cost-effective at the WTP thresholds of $150,000 per QALY in the US and $36,024 per QALY in China for patients with advanced NSCLC who are ineligible for platinum-based chemotherapy.",,,

This study employed Colaizzi's descriptive phenomenological method to explore nursing students' experiences. Semi-structured interviews were conducted, and data collection continued until information saturation was achieved. Data analysis followed Colaizzi's seven-step approach: (1) reading all participants' descriptions to gain a general understanding, (2) extracting significant statements, (3) formulating meanings from these statements, (4) organizing formulated meanings into clusters of themes, (5) developing an exhaustive description, (6) refining the description into a fundamental structure, and (7) validating the findings by returning to participants for feedback. A socialization theory framework was applied to analyze relationships between themes and clarify the mechanisms underlying professional identity development. From March 1 to March 13, 2023, 21 nursing students from seven medical schools in Guangdong Province participated in the research. The findings showed that nursing students' professional identity, initially medium or low before the epidemic, significantly improved afterward. Three key themes related to professional identity improvement were identified based on socialization theory: (1) Social Practice Experience: Activities such as volunteer services and pandemic prevention education promote role affirmation, meaningful engagement, and a strong professional mission. (2) Role Model Observation: Observing frontline healthcare workers enhances professional honor and role expectations. (3) Social Comparison and Evaluation: Positive feedback from media, family, and peers encourages respect and enthusiasm for nursing. The COVID-19 pandemic markedly improved nursing students' professional identity, providing insights for education and career development. To strengthen nursing education, it is advised to emphasize disaster response training, integrate role model examples, and utilize social recognition to foster students' professional identity and commitment.",,,

HI is the most frequent cause of severe, persistent hypoglycemia in newborns and children. Disease management is focused on preventing the neurological consequences associated with hypoglycemic brain injury; however, treatment is complex, often suboptimal, and places a large burden on families and individuals living with HI. Congenital Hyperinsulinism International (CHI) is an international patient organization that received a grant from the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative to establish the CHI Collaborative Research Network (CRN), a collaborative body to accelerate research for HI. Stakeholder groups relevant to HI, including individuals living with HI, families, researchers, clinicians, nurses, and industry partners, were identified to join the CRN and work together to create a prioritized research agenda (PRA) to systematically rank research priorities. CRN members worked across 7 workstream groups through a structured process to brainstorm gaps and corresponding solutions to formalize the HI PRA. A total of 362 gaps were identified across research, infrastructure, knowledge, and funding. All groups identified the need for an HI Natural History Study; therefore, this item was identified as a priority that would automatically be placed on the finalized list. Other top gaps identified in the PRA addressed preventing brain damage and the need to increase awareness and understanding related to the role of early and effective diagnosis in preventing brain damage. The formation of the CRN and the development of the PRA have already led to new collaborations, which are fundamental to progress. The PRA process allowed individuals to come to a consensus on the critical needs and to chart short- and long-term approaches to fill the gaps. CRN members continue to meet regularly in working groups focused on special projects to fill gaps identified as high priority by the PRA.

By aggregating real-world data (RWD), registries provide invaluable insights into real-world evidence (RWE), shaping clinical guidelines, healthcare policies, and regulatory decisions. Their widespread acceptance underscores their scientific validity and their role in driving evidence-based medicine, ultimately improving healthcare outcomes. In cardiology, particularly within the specialized field of congenital heart disease (CHD), national and international registries have emerged as indispensable tools. They enable the systematic collection of data on patient demographics, disease progression, therapeutic interventions, and long-term outcomes. These datasets support a range of purposes, including observational studies, quality improvement initiatives, and regulatory assessments of medical devices or pharmaceuticals. Establishing a high-quality registry requires meticulous planning and adherence to established guidelines. Professional organizations, such as the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) and the American Heart Association (AHA), offer detailed guidance documents for setting up and managing registries. Additionally, various checklists and frameworks exist to evaluate and ensure registry quality, aiding researchers in optimizing data reliability and utility. With advancements in digital health, the potential of electronic health records (EHRs) to complement or replace traditional registries is increasingly explored.

Clinical manifestations vary widely, involving multiple organs. Delays in diagnosis and deficits in primary care are common due to the limited familiarity with this rare disease in primary care providers [PCPs; including general practitioners (GPs), family physicians, and specialists in internal medicine]. This study aims to assess the real-world healthcare situation of FD patients in Germany through a questionnaire-based approach. In this cross-sectional study, 103 FD patients were consecutively recruited from several medical institutions in Germany and Austria between August 2022 and April 2024. The study adhered to ethical guidelines and received approvals from all relevant ethics committees. Inclusion criteria included confirmed FD diagnosis, age 18 years or older, and the ability to provide informed consent. Data were collected using a 32-question survey covering demographics, comorbidities, care structures, information needs, quality of life (QoL), and challenges. Descriptive statistical methods were used for data analysis of the study population. The analysis included 103 completed questionnaires. The average age of the patient cohort was 49.3±16.2 (range, 18-94) years, with a higher proportion of women (61.2%) participating. The most common symptoms reported were hearing loss/tinnitus (45.6%), followed by thermal sensory disturbances and hypohidrosis (43.7%). A majority of PCP (86.4%) were aware of their patients' FD diagnosis. Overall, 61.2% of patients were not primarily treated by their PCP, but in collaboration with Fabry specialists.

This study highlights significant deficiencies in the medical care of FD patients in Germany, including insufficient knowledge of specialized centers and patient organizations, as well as unmet counselling needs. Despite the availability of at least 24 FD competence centers in Germany, many patients remain under the care of GPs who may lack specific knowledge about FD. Since FD is a rare disease, enhanced education for both patients and GPs about FD and about the benefits of specialized care and patient organizations is crucial. Additionally, comprehensive counselling services should be developed to address the various needs of FD patients. Future research should investigate the overall care situations also in other countries to provide a broader understanding and to improve global health care standards for FD patients.",Lagler FB; Regenbogen C,Institut für angeborene Stoffwechselerkrankungen und Universitätskinderklinik; Abteilung für Nephrologie - Nierenheilkunde,
40385227,Organizational readiness for change: A systematic review of the healthcare literature.,,Implementation research and practice,10.1177/26334895251334536,"Organizational readiness for change (ORC), referring to psychological and behavioral preparedness of organizational members for implementation, is often cited in healthcare implementation research. However, evidence about whether and under which conditions ORC is relevant for positive implementation results remains ambiguous, with past studies building on various theories and assessing ORC with different measures. To strengthen the ORC knowledge base, we therefore identified factors investigated in the empirical literature alongside ORC, or as mediators and/or moderators of ORC and implementation. We conducted a systematic review of experimental, observational, and hybrid studies in physical, mental, and public health care that included a quantitative assessment of ORC and at least one other factor (e.g., ORC correlate, predictor, moderator, or mediator). Studies were identified searching five online databases and bibliographies of included studies, employing dual abstract and full text screening. The study synthesis was guided by the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research integrated with the Theory of ORC. Study quality was appraised using the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool. Of 2,907 identified studies, 47 met inclusion criteria, investigating a broad range of factors alongside ORC, particularly contextual factors related to individuals and the innovation. Various ORC measures, both home-grown or theory-informed, were used, confirming a lack of conceptual clarity surrounding ORC. In most studies, ORC was measured only once. This systematic review highlights the broad range of factors investigated in relation to ORC, suggesting that such investigation may enhance interpretation of implementation results. However, the observed diversity in ORC conceptualization and measurement supports previous calls for clearer conceptual definitions of ORC. Future efforts should integrate team-level perspectives, recognizing ORC as both an individual and team attribute. Prioritizing the use of rigorous, repeated ORC measures in longitudinal implementation research is essential for advancing the collective ORC knowledge base.",,,

While systemic (pharmacological) therapy is currently established as the 'standard of care', effective local ulcer management remains crucial for all cases of DUs. This is particularly true for patients who cannot tolerate systemic treatments or in the case of refractory SSc-DUs. On this background, there is a pressing demand for the formulation of evidence-based guidelines to assist clinicians and patients in navigating the local treatment options for DUs. A steering committee of international experts was established by the World Scleorderma Foundation (WSF) Digital Ulcer (DU) ad hoc committee. Two systematic literature reviews on local non-surgical and surgical treatments for the management of SSc-DUs were performed to inform the development of local treatment recommendations for SSc-DUs. Consensus methodology was used to develop the final treatment recommendations. Six overarching treatment principles and eight local treatment recommendations (five non-surgical and three surgical) were agreed upon for the management of SSc-DU. Among topical non-surgical options, botulin toxin can be conditionally recommended for refractory and/or severe DUs. Among surgical treatments, autologous adipose tissue grafting might be recommended for DU healing when combined with background systemic treatments. These recommendations are specifically tailored to guide treatment decisions concerning both local and non-pharmacological approaches to managing SSc-related DUs. Our work has highlighted a notable quality gap in comparison to systemic treatments, underscoring the scarcity of high-quality studies concerning this topic.",Hughes M,Department of Rheumatology,
40384819,Countries with Fewer Procedures for Cardiovascular Disease Management Face Greater Premature Mortality from Noncommunicable Diseases.,,Indian journal of community medicine : official publication of Indian Association of Preventive & Social Medicine,10.4103/ijcm.ijcm_420_23,"The rate at which low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) are transitioning into high-burden states for noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) is currently posing a global health security threat. Not only cardiovascular disease (CVD) occurs earlier in these countries but also it is likely that individuals do not have access to adequate management procedures. The present study was undertaken to find the effect of availability of procedures for CVD management on premature mortality in NCDs and to juxtapose this with the prevalence of two main risk factors, hypertension and diabetes. The World Health Organization's Global Health Observatory data were used, which include health-related data on its 194 member states. The correlation matrix was constructed for risk factors, income classification, availability of CVD management procedures, and premature NCD mortality. Multiple linear regression was done to find the association between availability of management procedures, income classification, and premature NCD mortality. A negative correlation was observed between premature NCD mortality and income group and between premature NCD mortality and availability of CVD management procedures. Countries possessing fewer procedures for CVD management suffered a greater burden of premature NCD mortality, and this was in the form of a strong linear association. Income class and availability of CVD management procedures both independently affected premature NCD mortality. Each unit increase in income class and number of CVD management procedures reduced the premature NCD mortality by 7.9 and 2.8 units, respectively. The impact of both these factors on premature NCD mortality was statistically significant. Countries with higher prevalence of hypertension were seen to be possessing fewer CVD management procedures. Income groups also demonstrated disparities, with high-income countries bearing less burden of hypertension and having more ubiquitous CVD management resources. The present study found that availability of CVD management procedures, such as thrombolysis, coronary bypass/stenting, and acute stroke care and rehabilitation, significantly reduce premature NCD mortality across the world. Countries that face higher burden of premature NCD mortality are not only the ones that are least prepared to manage them but also the ones that bear the greatest prevalence of risk factors like hypertension and diabetes. Making procedures for NCD management available in LMICs must be put on high priority on the global health agenda.",,,

Unfortunately, the termination rate of clinical trials (CTs) testing potential OM interventions remains high. Here, we compared the characteristics of failed trials and matched completed trials to identify common features, which might inform better study design. CTs for the prevention/treatment of OM were identified using  Failed OM CTs were more likely to have academic sponsorship (45.7% vs. 39.1%), nonrandomized design (19.6% vs. 4.3%), and lower mean subject accrual (27.8 subjects vs. 101.4 subjects) compared to completed trials. The leading reason for termination was recruitment/enrollment (37.9%). Recruitment/enrollment and safety/efficacy accounted for failure in 84.6% of phase II trials. Contrary to general CTs where safety/efficacy concerns predominate, our results suggest OM-related trial failures are associated with a broader list of challenges including recruitment/enrollment, funding/sponsorship, and investigator/site issues. OM CTs demand aggressive planning, funding, and careful selection of trial sites and sponsorship to assure timely subject recruitment and reduce the risk for early termination and withdrawal.",,,

Drawing from a thematic analysis of notes and discussions from the Center's community engagement core, we present lessons learned from three examples of language justice: inclusion of bilingual team members, community mini-grants, and centering community in community-academic meetings. Facilitating strategies included preparing and reviewing materials in advance for interpretation/translation, live simultaneous interpretation for bilingual spaces, and in-language documents. Barriers included: time commitment and expenses, slow organizational shifts to collectively practice language justice, and institutional-level administrative hurdles beyond the community engagement core's influence. Strengthening language justice means integrating language justice institutionally and into all research processes; dedicating time and processes to learn about and practice language justice; equitably funding language justice within research budgets; equitably engaging bilingual, bicultural staff and language justice practitioners; and creating processes for language justice in written and oral research and collaborative activities. Language justice is not optional and necessitates buy-in, leadership, and support of community engagement cores, Center leadership, university administrators, and funders.

A Scoping Review.,,World journal of surgery,10.1002/wjs.12626,"Trauma is a major source of morbidity and mortality globally, but low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) are disproportionately affected by higher volumes of trauma and worse health outcomes. Despite this, there are limited data describing how many individuals in these regions need trauma surgery, and how many are able to access it. We performed a scoping review to examine the current available evidence on the need for, and access to, trauma surgery in LMICs in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews guidelines. We included studies published after 2000, across all languages, that reported data on LMICs, as defined by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. We identified 32 articles describing the need for trauma surgery and 24 articles describing the access to trauma surgery, representing 27 LMICs overall. The median rate of trauma need was 7361 individuals per 100,000 per year (IQR 6313-9461), whereas the median rate of trauma surgery was 64.8 procedures per 100,000 per year. Our study suggests that the need for trauma surgery is far greater than the access provided in LMICs. Indeed, the median rate of trauma surgery currently performed in the represented LMICs was 20 times less than the Lancet Commission on Global Surgery's benchmark. This scoping review illustrates the pressing requirement to generate high-quality prospective data to describe trauma care in LMICs.",Reyes LF; Saleh R; Caceres E,Clínica Universidad de la Sabana; Médicins Sans Frontières Medical Unit,

Journal of parenteral and enteral nutrition,10.1002/jpen.2771,"In response to coronavirus disease 19, healthcare organizations made dramatic and immediate shifts from in-person office to telehealth visits to provide care to patients while adhering to social distancing restrictions. The objective of this study was to test the efficacy of virtual visits compared with ""brick and mortar"" (in-person visits) for patients receiving home parenteral nutrition for clinical outcomes of the incidence of catheter complications and 30-day readmissions. A retrospective cohort study was conducted between January 2020 and December 2020 on eligible patients managed by the Cleveland Clinic Home Nutrition Support and the Center Gut Rehabilitation and Transplant teams. Those receiving home parenteral nutrition who were seen in a follow-up clinic appointment were included. Of 189 patients studied, 103 had in-person visits and 86 had virtual visits. A total of 7.9% (n = 15) of patients had catheter complications. Virtual visits demonstrated statistical noninferiority of the incidence of catheter-related complications when compared with in-person visits (90% CI, -0.051 to 0.106; margin <0.1). Readmission incidence for in-person visits was 8.5% (n = 16) and 6.3% (n = 12) for virtual visits. Virtual visits demonstrated statistical noninferiority to in-person visits for incidence of readmissions after the visit (90% CI, -0.094 to 0.106; margin <0.1). Virtual visits demonstrate noninferiority to in-person visits based on the incidence of catheter complications and readmission rates.

A mixed methods study using questionnaires and semi-structured interviews with patients and clinicians at two EDs in the same health service (tertiary ED and urban district ED) between May 2023 and February 2024. Quantitative data are reported descriptively using means and proportions. A qualitative descriptive approach and thematic analysis were used to develop themes from interviews and gather granular insights from participants' first-hand experiences. Clinicians completed 84 questionnaires and nine interviews. Patients completed 63 questionnaires and eight interviews. Quantitative and qualitative data were merged to form four themes: (1) the variable clinical utility of the PV in ED, (2) lack of ED clinician confidence and training, (3) bedside manner as primary influence on patient experience, and (4) the inadequate ED setting for performing intimate exams. The utility of PVs in ED remains ambiguous and it is vital to avoid unnecessary invasive exams. However, urgent PVs will sometimes be needed and participants have made actionable suggestions to improve the clinical care delivered when performing PVs in ED. The four themes can inform future strategies to advance clinicians' training, confidence and skill level when performing PVs. This will lead to overall enhanced patient experience and satisfaction and reduce downstream negative consequences of having an inadequate PV experience in ED.",Walker G,Department of Emergency Medicine,

Over the past decades, various organisational solutions have been proposed, ranging from dedicated Emergency Departments to liaison mechanisms involving mental health nurses within EDs or direct access to acute units. On one hand, there are clinical and organisational needs pushing towards the creation of dedicated pathways; on the other hand, there are concerns that such solutions may be counterproductive and dangerous in terms of health and social inclusion. The aim of this study is to assess the opinions of Mental Health and Emergency professionals on the advantages and disadvantages of clinical and organisational pathways dedicated to patients with psychiatric disorders who visit the general ED. The study was conducted using a qualitative research approach: semi-structured interviews were carried out through purposeful sampling composed of two cohorts: Emergency and Mental Health professionals. The data were analysed using content analysis with the software Atlas.ti. Forty-five interviews were collected, and six main themes/families were identified. A certain distance in opinions between the two cohorts emerged, especially regarding the adoption of dedicated pathways. In both cohorts, but particularly in the mental health cohort, there is a fear of stigmatisation and violation of patients' rights in dedicated pathways. Both groups believe that there is a need for more specific training and greater multidisciplinarity. This study adheres to the COREQ checklist for qualitative studies.",,,

The increasing emergence of FLZ resistance has led to higher morbidity and mortality rates. Streptomyces, a genus of Actinomycetes, produces bioactive molecules with antimicrobial effects. This study investigated the antifungal potential of S. monomycini strain 615 against FLZ-resistant C. albicans clinical isolates in vitro. S. monomycini strain 615 was cultured, and an aqueous crud extract containing its metabolites was prepared. The effects of extract were tested on five FLZ-resistant C. albicans isolates. Key pathogenic factors such as protease activity, biofilm formation, and gene expressions related to virulence (SAP1, SAP2, HWP1, and ERG11) and azole resistance (ERG11) were evaluated. Cytotoxicity of the extract (1.8-0.0008 µg/ml) was assessed on KYSE-30 esophageal epithelial cells using the MTT assay. Strain 615 showed strong antifungal activity with MIC values of 0.0008-0.0035 µg/ml and MFC values of 0.0017-0.0035 µg/ml after 48 hours. The extract significantly reduced ergosterol content by 31.81%, completely inhibited phospholipase and proteinase activities at 0.0035 µg/ml and suppressed biofilm formation at 0.0035-0.0140 µg/ml. Expression of all tested virulence genes decreased except for ERG11, indicating a possible mechanism to overcome azole resistance. The highest extract concentration caused 76.7% cytotoxicity in KYSE-30 cells after 72 hours. S. monomycini strain 615 could serve as an alternative or adjunct therapy for FLZ-resistant OPC in head and neck cancer patients, warranting further research to confirm safety and efficacy.",,,

This study aims to establish a comprehensive normative reference for connected speech measures in Cantonese by analysing a wide array of micro- and macro-structural measures, investigating the impact of age and education on these measures, and examining potential performance differences across various genres of descriptive discourse tasks. The sample included 149 healthy Cantonese-speaking adults who were categorized into three age groups (young, middle-aged, and old) and two education levels (high and low). Speech samples were collected, transcribed, and analysed based on five descriptive discourse tasks in the Cantonese AphasiaBank, including two single-picture descriptions (Flood and Cat rescue), two sequential picture descriptions (Broken window and Refuse umbrella), and one procedural description (Egg and ham sandwich). Normative reference of multiple connected speech measures (such as type, token, noun-verb ratio, Information Content Units [ICU] and Main Concepts [MC]) and lists of standard scoring criteria for the ICU and MC for the five tasks were presented. For age effect, statistical analysis revealed that the old group demonstrated less informativeness and fluency than younger groups across genres. Specifically in procedural description, the middle-aged group showed superior verbal productivity compared to the other groups and informativeness compared to the old group. For education effect, the high-education group outperformed the low-education group in verbal productivity and informativeness across genres. Age-education interaction was found in syntactic complexity measures across genres. These findings contribute to building a comprehensive normative reference for the evaluation of connected speech, providing a complementary tool for systematic and objective assessment. What is already known on this subject In the clinical context of assessment, discourse analysis is a crucial method for assessing language ability in individuals with acquired language impairments such as aphasia. Normative reference of the above-mentioned connected speech measures (both micro-structural and macro-structural) is fundamental to systematic discourse analysis because it provides an anchor for comparison. Apart from discourse tasks from traditional aphasia assessment batteries, a large set of US English norms have also been established for discourse tasks included in the aphasia language databases of AphasiaBank. What this study adds This is one of the very few reports in Cantonese that established a comprehensive and large-scale normative reference for connected speech measures based on spontaneous oral discourse production from a sizeable group of native Cantonese speakers. Normative reference of an extensive array of connected speech measures, which includes multiple micro-structural (linguistically-based) and macro-structural (content-based) measures is provided. What are the clinical implications of this study? Establishment of this linguistically and culturally specific normative reference enables more systematic and objective assessment of connected speech production in diseased populations, such as aphasia. Uncovering the effects of age and educational is crucial for theoretical inference of the impact of ageing and education level on language proficiency, as neglecting these effects can lead to biased comparisons when applying the norm to make clinical inferences.",,,

SSD diagnosis was operationalized as having persistent symptoms and SSD-12 ≥ 16 (≥23 in sensitivity analyses). 15-27% of the sample met criteria for SSD at 6 months post-injury. Participants with SSD reported more pain and post-concussion symptoms, and were more likely to have comorbid Major Depressive Disorder (OR = 9.1, 95% CI = 5.3, 16.2) and at least 1 anxiety disorder (OR = 5.6, 95% CI = 3.6-8.8) compared to those without SSD. Early illness beliefs, specifically that mTBI has serious life consequences (OR = 1.2, 95% CI = 1.1-1.3) and causes distress (OR = 1.1, 95% CI = 1.0-1.2), were associated with later SSD. SSD symptoms contributed to prediction of global functional disability (WHODAS) over and above post-concussion symptom severity (RPQ; ΔDeviance = 0.22, P < .001). SSD after mTBI is associated with an increased burden of symptoms, comorbidity, and disability. Early identification of at-risk patients appears feasible.

This study evaluates a multi-agent system intended to assist clinicians with antibiotic therapy and adherence to current sepsis management guidelines before diagnostic results become available. A multi-agent system incorporating three specialized agents was developed: a sepsis management agent, an antibiotic recommendation agent, and a sepsis guidelines compliance agent. A sepsis case from the MIMIC IV database, organized as a clinical vignette, was used to integrate and test these agents for generating management recommendations. The system leverages retrieval-augmented generation to improve decision-making through the integration of current literature and guidelines. The application produced management recommendations for a sepsis case associated with pneumonia, including early initiation of broad-spectrum antibiotics and close monitoring for clinical deterioration. Two expert intensivists evaluated these recommendations as ""acceptable"" and reported moderate interrater agreement (Cohen's kappa = 0.622, p = 0.003) across various aspects of recommendation usefulness. The multi-agent system shows promise in enhancing decision-making for sepsis management by optimizing antibiotic therapy and ensuring guideline compliance. However, reliance on a single case study limits the generalizability of the findings, highlighting the need for broader validation in diverse clinical settings to improve patient outcomes.",,,

We aimed to assess if adequate information is documented in unstructured clinical notes of a large EHR database to serve as a reference standard for future validation studies of VA/SCA. Twenty potential VA/SCA events were randomly selected from unstructured clinical notes of a large EHR database, TriNetX Dataworks - USA. These notes were reviewed to assess if key clinical elements were documented to confirm the occurrence of VA/SCA and describe their clinical features. These included explicit documentation of an acute event, electrocardiogram (ECG) findings, urgent medical interventions, and other elements. Explicit documentation of an acute event was recorded for 17 patients (85.0%) and ECG findings were documented for 15 patients (75.0%). Generally, unstructured clinical notes also contained information about signs and symptoms, care setting, medical interventions administered, and event resolution. The unstructured clinical notes of a large EHR database contained the information necessary to serve as a reference standard for validation studies of a VA/SCA operational algorithm in EHR data. Ventricular arrhythmia and sudden cardiac arrest (VA/SCA) accounts for up to 50% of all cardiovascular disease-related deaths and is a potential adverse event of certain medications, making it an important public health and drug safety concern. Studies using large electronic databases such as electronic health records (EHR) data are useful for studying VA/SCA because of their large sample size; however, the ability of EHR databases to accurately identify VA/SCA occurrence is unclear. To assess the accuracy of an operational algorithm (i.e. diagnosis, medication, and other codes) to identify VA/SCA in an EHR database, a validation study must be conducted in which the performance of the algorithm is compared to a reference standard. We aimed to assess if adequate information to serve as a reference standard for future validation studies of VA/SCA is documented in clinical notes written by physicians, nurses, and other healthcare providers contributing to an EHR data network of healthcare organizations with inpatient and outpatient care. We randomly selected 20 potential VA/SCA events from the clinical notes of this EHR data source and reviewed the notes to assess if key clinical elements were documented to confirm the occurrence and describe clinical features of VA/SCA. We found that the clinical notes provided adequate information to confirm VA/SCA event occurrence and had detailed information on other features such as signs and symptoms, care setting, and medical interventions.

The Swedish healthcare system is primarily tax-funded, with 86% of total healthcare expenditures from public expenses and < 1% from voluntary health insurance. The gross domestic product (GDP) share of healthcare expenditures, 10.5% in 2022, is above the EU average. The level of unmet needs in the population is low, due to universal coverage and caps on user charges except for dental care. Sweden's healthcare system performs well on care quality and patient satisfaction, but suffers from workforce shortage and care fragmentation. Limitations in care coordination can be attributed to a siloed digital infrastructure and care governance, a low number of hospital beds per capita, and a compensation system that often does not incentivize coordination. Despite these challenges, life expectancy is high and avoidable mortality rates are low in Sweden.",Geijerstam JA; Lindh M; Kaarme J,The Swedish Agency for Health and Care Services Analysis; The Swedish Stomach and Bowel Association; Swedish Association of Local Authorities and Regions,jonasludvigsson@yahoo.com.
40383757,The effect of implementing parenteral nutrition guideline on growth and clinical outcomes in preterm infants: a comparative study.,2025-05-18,BMC pediatrics,10.1186/s12887-025-05735-0,"To improve the nutritional management of premature infants in neonatal intensive care units (NICUs), we developed and implemented a standardized parenteral nutrition (PN) protocol aimed at optimizing early macronutrient delivery. This study evaluated the impact of the new protocol on growth parameters and clinical outcomes in preterm neonates. This prospective, non-randomized interventional cohort study included two groups of preterm infants born before 32 weeks of gestation or with birth weights under 1250 g. The PRE group received individualized PN formulations based on clinician discretion, while the POST group received PN guided by a newly introduced, stepwise algorithmic protocol aiming to optimize early protein and energy intake. Anthropometric data, daily energy and macronutrient intakes during the first 14 days, and weight at day 28 were collected. Clinical outcomes-including the incidence of sepsis, necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) and hospitalization duration-were compared between groups. A total of 139 infants were enrolled (69 PRE, 70 POST). While weight gain in the first 14 days was similar, the POST group showed significantly greater weight and weight velocity by day 28. These improvements paralleled higher mean daily energy and protein intakes during the early postnatal period. The incidence of bacterial sepsis was significantly reduced in the POST cohort, possibly reflecting better nutritional status and improved PN preparation practices. Although other complications did not differ significantly, fewer infants in the POST group required prolonged hospitalization (> 90 days). Implementation of a standardized PN protocol improved early nutritional intake and was associated with better growth and reduced infection rates in premature infants. These findings support the use of structured PN strategies to enhance early neonatal outcomes in NICU settings.

40383729,MoCA and MMSE for the detection of post-stroke cognitive impairment: a comparative diagnostic test accuracy systematic review and meta‑analysis.,2025-05-18,Journal of neurology,10.1007/s00415-025-13146-5,"Post-stroke cognitive impairment (PSCI) is one of the serious complications of stroke, which profoundly influences the quality of life of stroke survivors. The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) and the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) are the two cognitive screening tools most widely used in stroke settings. Previous studies investigated the diagnostic accuracy of MoCA and MMSE but yielded controversial results. We conducted this study to compare the diagnostic accuracy of MoCA with MMSE for PSCI. Embase, PubMed, CINAHL, Web of Science, and The Cochrane Library were searched until August 17, 2024 for diagnostic accuracy studies comparing MoCA and MMSE. Data extraction was performed by two independent researchers. Risk of bias and applicability assessment was evaluated by the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2 tool. Coupled forest plots and hierarchical summary receiver operating characteristic (hsROC) curves were created in R statistical software. 9 studies with 1,135 patients were included in this review. Most studies were at high risk of bias. MoCA displayed a pooled sensitivity of 0.80 (95% CI 0.72 to 0.86) and specificity of 0.79 (95% CI 0.71 to 0.85). MMSE displayed a sensitivity and specificity of 0.76 (95% CI 0.71 to 0.81) and 0.78 (95% CI 0.73 to 0.83), respectively. No difference was shown between these modalities (SEN p = 0.36, SPE p = 0.80). No difference was observed between MoCA and MMSE in the detection of PSCI. We recommend both screeners be considered for the detection of PSCI based on the purpose of the test and by other metrics, such as acceptability and feasibility. Although it should be noted MoCA and MMSE were cognitive screening tools in stroke settings and not a substitute for detailed clinical assessment.",,,914960539@qq.com.

Psychologists are well equipped and uniquely positioned to conduct clinical research given the significant research component of clinical training. Despite this, relatively little is known about how psychologists working in Australian public health rate their own skills and capacity for research at a team and organisational level.MethodsNinety-two psychologists working at Monash Health, Victoria, Australia completed the validated Research Capacity and Culture tool and answered questions relating to perceived barriers and motivators to research engagement in their clinical roles.ResultsWhile psychologists rated their own individual capacity to engage in research as high, they perceived the research skills and success of their clinical teams and the organisation as low to moderate. Inductive content analyses revealed constraints of clinical role, lack of system/infrastructure, and lack of organisational/team visibility as barriers to research engagement, whereas drive for clinical excellence, internal motivation and a positive team culture were highlighted as motivators.ConclusionsWe discuss the potential untapped resource of psychologists in Australian public health who are interested and skilled to engage in research but perceive challenges of a lack of research capacity and culture within their team and organisation.",Lee YC; Miller C; Ure A,,

To assess whether a clinicopathological risk prediction model (Erasmus MC model) can enhance the identification of high-risk metastatic patients within current European and National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines for CSCC. A Dutch nested case-control (NCC) cohort (n=390 derived from N=12,325), was first stratified by guideline-defined risk groups. Each high-risk group was further stratified using thresholds for the risk estimated by the Erasmus MC model. The performance was assessed in an independent English NCC cohort (n=696, derived from N=31,981). The European guideline-defined high-risk group had a 3-year metastatic risk of 3.8% (95% CI 2.4%-5.2%). Within this group, 18.2% of the patients were identified with a higher 3-year risk of 10.1% (95% CI 6.7%-13.5%). For the NCCN-defined very high-risk group, the overall 3-year risk was 7.4% (95% CI 2.0%-9.2%). Of these, 34.5% of the patients had an even greater risk, of 14.0% (95% CI 8.3%-19.6%) LIMITATIONS: Routinely collected healthcare data often lacks detailed clinical information.

A difference-in-differences (DiD) design was used to estimate the effect of the EHR+AI intervention on quality measures among nursing homes with and without the AI intervention. The intervention included a feature that analyzed 150 daily clinical data elements per patient, alerting staff to changes in conditions, acuity, fall risk, and medication monitoring. The analysis included 218 nursing homes, with 94 using EHR+AI and 124 using EHR only. Baseline differences in organizational characteristics, acuity index, neighborhood affluence, and racial or ethnic composition were evaluated. Eighteen quality measures from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) were analyzed over 6 quarters before and 5 quarters after EHR+AI implementation. A DiD approach with linear mixed effects models was used, adjusting for significantly different baseline characteristics. Statistically greater improvements were observed in 16 of 18 quality measures (89%) in EHR+AI sites, with 11 measures (61%) also meeting the parallel trends assumption. Notably, EHR+AI sites demonstrated larger improvements in functional status, including greater reductions in major falls (-9%, 95% CI -17, -1; P = .034) and residents needing help with daily activities (-22%, 95% CI -29, -15; P < .001), and a 5% larger increase in residents who made improvements in function (95% CI 2, 7; P = .001). Higher decline in depressive symptoms and the use of antipsychotic, antianxiety, or hypnotic medications were also noted. These results were observed among sites with higher patient acuity and neighborhood diversity. These findings suggest that an EHR enhanced with AI can improve the quality and efficiency of care in nursing homes through real-time monitoring and response of resident assessment protocol triggers for clinical modification, but further research is needed.",Zhu D; Rainey AJ; Salisbury A,PruittHealth; MatrixCare,vy.vuong@resmed.com.

Report of two cases and literature review.,,International journal of surgery case reports,10.1016/j.ijscr.2025.111444,"Para-anastomotic aneurysms (PAAs) represent a late complication of open surgical repair for occlusive or aneurysmal disease of the abdominal aorta. Due to limited literature and management challenges, we present two cases of PAAs and review existing evidence. CLINICAL DISCUSSION: The FEVAR approach avoids redo laparotomy, reducing risks of blood loss, and splanchnic injury. However, prior open repair requires careful endograft design, considering the graft's configuration, reduced compliance, and altered visceral anatomy. For distal anastomotic aneurysms, open repair was chosen due to fewer challenges from adjacent structures. Based on our experience, FEVAR is effective for juxta-renal PAAs near the proximal anastomosis, while open repair is preferred for PAAs at the distal anastomosis. Further large-scale, long-term studies comparing these treatments are warranted.",,,aa.ahrabi@gmail.com.

However, it remains unknown if patients who received treatment at different times had differential neuropsychiatric outcomes. We examined if patients who received immediate treatment less than one week after a mild concussion had a different risk for subsequent depression or anxiety compared with those who received delayed treatment greater than one week after the event, stratified by age groups. This multicenter retrospective cohort study used the TriNetX Analytics platform to access de-identified electronic health records of over 100 million patients, including both inpatient and outpatient visits, from 60 healthcare organizations across the United States. A total of 9881 patients with a diagnosis of mild concussion either received either immediate treatment, defined as within 1 week (n = 4053), or delayed treatment, defined as 1 week to 6 months (n = 5828) following the diagnosis of mild concussion. Each group was stratified by age:≤25, 26-64, and 65+ years. Patients who received early treatment had significantly lower risk of depression and anxiety compared with propensity-score matched patients who received delayed treatment during a 5-year follow-up after mild TBI diagnosis, with hazard ratios (HRs) of 0.74 (95 % CI, 0.65-0.84) and 0.75 (95 % CI, 0.68-0.84), respectively. These results are consistent across age groups, with strongest reduction in older adults aged 65 years and older. These findings suggest that timely treatment for concussion may mitigate subsequent adverse psychiatric outcomes.",,,rxx@case.edu.

However, interindividual variability in clinical response to aripiprazole, possibly linked to its D2 partial agonism and D2 upregulation due to prior antipsychotics, has been reported. This study assessed whether there would be symptomatic aggravations or adverse events in clinically stable patients with schizophrenia when switching from oral antipsychotics to aripiprazole once-monthly (AOM), considering prior antipsychotics: oral aripiprazole (Group I) or other D2 antagonists (Group II). This was a 20-week, prospective, open-label, multicenter trial. Clinically stable patients with schizophrenia were assigned to two groups based on their oral antipsychotic medication and received AOM every 4 weeks. The primary endpoint was a change from baseline in the total Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) score. Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were monitored. Altogether, 100 patients in Group I and 101 in Group II completed the study. The mean changes (±SD) from baseline in PANSS total score after switching to AOM were - 9.43 ± 9.79 in Group I (p < 0.0001) and - 4.04 ± 8.72 in Group II (p = 0.0102). Compared to Group I, in Group II, more sleep disturbance (p = 0.0243) and psychotic symptoms (p = 0.0042) TEAE emerged after AOM initiation, with both TEAEs resolving during the study. Psychotic symptoms TEAE was associated with faster tapering of the prior oral antipsychotics (p = 0.0269). Initiating AOM did not aggravate symptoms. Furthermore, AOM ameliorated psychotic symptoms without any significant adverse effect, regardless of their prior oral antipsychotics. However, patients previously treated with D2 antagonists may experience transient psychiatric TEAEs that can be minimized with longer cross-titration.",,,kwonjs@snu.ac.kr.

To examine the patterns of SDL engagement among internal medicine residents, their attitudes and behaviors with various resources, and evaluate the relationship between the clinical learning environment (CLE) and the time residents allocate to SDL and types of resources. This cross-sectional study used a systematic questionnaire informed by previous qualitative research on SDL among internal medicine residents. Internal medicine (IM) residents from 10 residency programs across the United States participated, providing a diverse representation of geographical and institutional contexts. Residents were asked to estimate weekly hours spent on SDL during their last clinical rotation, on which resources, and then to rank the usefulness of each resource. The survey also measured several variables, including attitudes and behaviors after using the resource they perceived to be the most useful, and the influence of training level, residency program type, clinical rotation, and number of hours worked clinically per week on reported time spent on SDL and types of resources. The response rate was 69.5% (783/1,126). Residents dedicated a mean of 18.2 (SD 18.6) hours per week (median of 10.5 hours per week) to SDL. Community-based programs reported more hours of SDL. There was no difference in hours spent on SDL based on the last clinical rotation, number of hours worked clinically, or PGY level. Senior residents favored digital resources, like podcasts, and were less likely to use traditional resources, like textbooks than interns. Our findings underscore the substantial time residents devote to SDL. In light of these results, educators and healthcare systems will need to work together to better support residents in optimizing the complex clinical learning environment.",Larsen T,Department of Medicine,

Despite recent evidence and rapid implementation, many questions around safe implementation and wider implications remain unanswered. Developing a logic model and dark logic model aimed to illustrate the recent evidence base with input from key informants and conceptualise the research focus for further work. Triangulation of three workstreams for comprehensiveness and credibility, involved (1) document analysis using publicly available documents, and non-published documents (including grey literature) provided by key stakeholders or virtual ward forums, (2) key informant interviews with a variety of expertise involved in the planning, implementation, or delivery of HaH, and (3) a focus group, to reach consensus on the final refined logic models. These were analysed using content analysis using an inductive and deductive approach to refine the logic models after each workstream. A draft logic model was developed from document analysis describing key components of the logic model and dark logic models. Interviews with 12 participants helped refine the logic models with a subsequent focus group for consensus. The key themes for sustainability were securing clinical 'buy-in', effective communication, potential workforce re-modelling and optimising operational capabilities. Concerns and challenges were raised such as continuous funding, inadequate shared systems and duplication. These logic models provide a clear visual representation of intended (logic) and unintended outcomes (dark logic) of HaH (virtual wards) in England, and factors contributing to them. They can support prioritising future research or program planning and evaluation. Future research should explore strategies to deliver this personalised holistic care safely and effectively whilst maximising potential of resources like digital technology and understanding it's impact on patients and equity.",,,f.yahya2@newcastle.ac.uk.

Yet, existing studies on their global burden are outdated and lack predictive foresight. Public data from the 2021 GBD study were analyzed to assess the global burden and epidemiological trends of vertebral fractures. The annual percentage change (EAPC) was calculated to represent temporal trends from 1990 to 2021. Machine learning was used to predict the global burden of vertebral fractures over the next 30 years. From 1990 to 2021, the global burden of vertebral fractures significantly decreased. The age-standardized incidence rates (ASIR) showed the largest decline in Eastern Sub-Saharan Africa (EAPC: -1.5; 95% CI: -2.0 to -1.0), while North Africa and the Middle East were the only regions to report an increase (EAPC: 0.3; 95% CI: 0.1 to 0.5). For age-standardized prevalence rates (ASPR), High-income Asia Pacific saw the steepest decline (EAPC: -1.4; 95% CI: -1.5 to -1.2), while the Caribbean experienced the largest increase (EAPC: 0.8; 95% CI: 0.4 to 1.3). Similarly, in terms of age-standardized years lived with disability rates (ASYR), the most substantial reduction occurred in High-income Asia Pacific (EAPC: -1.4; 95% CI: -1.5 to -1.3), with the Caribbean again showing the greatest rise (EAPC: 0.8; 95% CI: 0.3 to 1.2). Males generally exhibited higher age-standardized rates (ASRs) than females, although females aged 65-70 years old surpassed males. Predictive models suggest continued declines in global ASIR, ASPR, and ASYR by 2050. Our study shows a steady reduction in the global burden of vertebral fractures from 1990 to 2021.

Understanding the burden of aortic aneurysm is crucial for formulating effective public health intervention policies and allocating resources. The study aims to assess the global, regional, and national burden, trend, and inequalities of aortic aneurysm. Aortic aneurysm-associated mortality, disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs), age-standardized mortality rate (ASMR), age-standardized disability-adjusted life-years (ASDR), and their average annual percentage change (AAPC) were estimated based on a population-based study, the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) 2021. The global, regional, and national burden of aortic aneurysm was analyzed across 204 countries and territories from 1990 to 2021, stratified by sex, sociodemographic index (SDI), and further predicted to 2045. The ASMR decreased from 2.54 per 100,000 population in 1990 to 1.86 per 100,000 population in 2021, with an AAPC of -0.99%. The ASDR declined from 48.79 per 100,000 population in 1990 to 36.54 per 100,000 population in 2021, with an AAPC of -0.90%. The most significant decline in ASDR was observed among males (-1.14% vs. -0.68% per year). ASMR increased considerably, especially in countries with a low-middle SDI (1.29% per year), while it dropped particularly in countries with a high SDI (-1.65% per year). Notably, though the number of mortality and DALYs was predicted to continue rising, the ASMR and ASDR for aortic aneurysm were projected to decrease annually from, with predicted values of 1.92 per 100,000 population and 40.38 per 100,000 population in 2045, respectively. The global relative burden of individuals with aortic aneurysm decreased since 1990, along with a prominent decrease in related ASMR and ASDR.

However, considering the high density of students and the potential for epidemic relapse, our medical morphological teaching team established a novel blended learning mode with mainly offline teaching in the general sections and blend learning in systematic sections. Specifically, this study sought to improve the teaching quality of the two courses of ""Histology and Embryology"" and ""Pathology"", and lay a solid foundation for clinical medical undergraduates to learn medical courses well in the future. In the Spring 2021 semester, two classes from the Class of 2019 and two classes from the Class of 2020 were randomly selected as the intervention groups, to carry out blended learning of ""Histology and Embryology"", and ""Pathology"", respectively. Meanwhile, four parallel classes were randomly selected as control groups to carry out completely traditional offline teaching. The blended learning was based on outcome-based education concepts and used small private online courses from the ""Xuexi Tong"" (Century Superstar Information Technology Development Co., Ltd., Beijing) platform. In the theory class, case-based learning following a self-designed P-C-P-E-S-E (Pre-class-Case-Problem-Expansion-Summary-Expansion) teaching sequence was implemented. In the experimental class, a virtual digital platform with flipped classroom learning was integrated. Both teaching satisfaction and students' scores were found to be significantly greater in the intervention group than in the control group. Furthermore, the intervention group also effectively surpassed the control group in terms of students' comprehensive abilities such as drawing, scientific research, participating in competitions, forensic case analysis, and so on. Our novel blended learning approach strengthened the communication between teachers and students, obviously improved students' self-directed learning abilities, and finally achieved the purpose of improving the comprehensive abilities of students. This mode is suited for the post-epidemic era and future variable environments. It also has substantial promotional instructive modeling value. Not applicable.",,,juliagl@126.com.

An assessment tool can facilitate the development and teaching of non-technical skills. The nurse anesthetist non-technical skills tool includes four categories and fifteen elements and is an adaptation of the existing tools for physician anesthetists and Danish nurse anesthetists. The ratings are on a five-step scale, with an option to select ""Not Relevant"". Since there doesn't exist an assessment tool for Swedish nurse anesthetists' non-technical skills, the aim of the study was to translate and adapt the assessment tool for nurse anesthetists' non-technical skills to a Swedish context and test its psychometric qualities among nurse anesthetists with experience in teaching nurse anesthetist students and junior nurse anesthetists in clinical settings. In this prospective psychometric evaluation study, sixteen nurse anesthetists were recruited. They rated 12 video clips of simulated anesthesia scenarios after participating in a three-hour calibration workshop. Four weeks later, a test-retest was conducted, which included five video clips. Internal consistency, Interrater reliability, and test-retest reliability were examined. Internal consistency showed acceptable results on the element level and Interrater reliability indicated good results. Retest reliability showed poor to moderate reliability. The use of ""Not Relevant"" varied significantly depending on the length of the video clip and the provider being rated. The raters considered the assessment tool suitable but initially challenging to use for rating non-technical skills among nurse anesthetists and articulate non-technical skills in anesthesia nursing. This initial testing of the Swedish nurse anesthetists' non-technical skills tool shows acceptable psychometric qualities and gives a foundation for future research. However, the rating ""Not Relevant"" poses challenges that need to be addressed. Nevertheless, the participants consider the assessment of non-technical skills in Swedish nurse anesthetists to be appropriate.",,,martin.jarl@ki.se.

A pre-post intervention study with a quasi-experimental, 1:1 matched design was used to measure the impact of implementing a technology-enabled care coordination platform on postpartum health care utilization. Deliveries were matched on patient and birth characteristics including age, race and ethnicity, marital status, insurance type, maternal comorbidities, and birth-specific factors. The impact of the Unite Us platform was assessed using conditional logistic regression, and results were stratified by insurance type, delivery method, low birthweight, preterm delivery, marriage status, infection complications, mental health diagnoses, and race/ethnicity. The study consisted of 1,996 deliveries with a live birth, 998 of which were to patients referred for community care through Unite Us from August 27, 2020 to January 31, 2023. These were matched with 998 deliveries with a live birth prior to Unite Us implementation, from January 1, 2019 to August 26, 2020. Matches were predominantly Medicare or Medicaid insured (65.0%), White, Non-Hispanic (56.6%) or Hispanic (28.2%), and never married (62.6%). When stratified by insurance type, patients who were enrolled in Medicaid/Medicare insurance at delivery were 59% less likely (OR: 0.41; 95% CI: 0.17 to 0.99) to be readmitted to the hospital within thirty days of discharge and were 55% less likely (OR: 0.45; 95% CI: 0.21 to 0.99) to have any OB-related inpatient admission within six months of discharge when compared to those who received usual care before Unite Us' implementation. Using the Unite Us platform as a digital tool to advance care coordination, the OB Service line within Sarasota Memorial observed statistically significant reductions in postpartum healthcare utilization in Medicaid/Medicare beneficiaries indicating that addressing non-medical, health-related needs may improve postpartum outcomes and reduce costs. These referral data are also used to facilitate community discussions on ways to build a more supportive network to improve maternal and child health outcomes.",Terry A; Arnold C; White Z; O'Connor M; Feldmeth G; Ahmadi-Montecalvo H,Unite Us; Sarasota Memorial Health Care System,amanda.terry@uniteus.com.
40382576,Perinatal outcomes and predictors of neonatal mortality in preterm premature rupture of membranes: a tertiary center experience.,2025-05-17,BMC pregnancy and childbirth,10.1186/s12884-025-07688-9,"Preterm premature rupture of membranes (PPROM) is a serious obstetric condition associated with increased maternal, fetal, and neonatal morbidity and mortality. It accounts for approximately one-third of all spontaneous preterm births and is associated with complications such as respiratory distress syndrome (RDS), sepsis, pulmonary hypoplasia, and neonatal mortality. Despite significant advances in prenatal care, proper management, particularly in early gestational age, remains unclear. Identifying factors associated with neonatal mortality in PPROM is important to develop therapeutic interventions and improve perinatal outcomes. This retrospective study examined clinical data and neonatal outcomes in 183 pregnant women with PPROM between the gestational ages of 23 and 36 + 6 weeks who were admitted to a tertiary referral hospital. The study population was categorized into four gestational age cohorts: Group I (23-27 + 6 weeks), Group II (28-31 + 6 weeks), Group III (32-33 + 6 weeks), and Group IV (34-36 + 6 weeks). Neonatal outcomes, including admission to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU), the incidence of respiratory distress syndrome, the requirement for oxygen and mechanical ventilation, the necessity for surfactant and inotropic support, sepsis, suspected pulmonary hypoplasia, and early and late neonatal mortality were compared between the groups. Group I had the highest CRP values (18.68 ± 21.34), while Group III had the lowest (6.81 ± 5.16). Significant differences were found between the groups in terms of death at discharge, gestational age at delivery, birth weight, and presence of oligohydramnios. The intubated group had higher CRP levels and lower gestational age and birth weight. Of the 14 neonatal deaths, eight occurred in the early neonatal period, corresponding to a mortality rate of 7.6%. The neonatal mortality rate was 63.2% in Group I. No deaths were recorded in Groups II and III. In Group IV, the mortality rate was 2.2%. Neonatal mortality was associated with low gestational age, low birth weight, and oligohydramnios. The predominant cause of early infant deaths was RDS, whereas late neonatal mortality was primarily attributed to sepsis. Specifically, active management options after 34 weeks of gestational age have demonstrated enhancements in neonatal outcomes, underscoring the significance of tailored clinical approaches in cases of PPROM.",,,tahaagaoglu@hotmail.com.

Promoting PA in the workplace is therefore of major public health interest, but is limited by employees' adherence. A systematic review was therefore carried out to identify factors for adherence to PA promotion program in the workplace (primary outcome); health outcomes were to be regarded as secondary outcomes. Four databases, PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (Cochrane CRCTs) and PsycInfo were searched to find all pertinent articles published from 2000 until June 2024. Only randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and clinical trials were selected. More than 9000 publications were analyzed and 91 were retrieved. Two main types of study were identified: 46 non-supervised PA programs (NSPAPs) supported by socio-cognitive theories, and 45 supervised (tailored) programs (SPAPs). Concerning the primary outcome, the main factors identified for adherence were the levels of baseline PA, health and motivation of the individual; intervention individualization at the interventional level; and work environment quality at the organizational level. This review highlighted significant health benefits in both types of study, with effect sizes ranging from small to large. Assessing these factors for adherence emerges as an essential prerequisite before implementing a PA promotion program in the workplace. According to our results, implementing NSPAPs, supported by socio-cognitive theories, is rather complex, and such programs can be difficult to operationalize in their entirety; consequently, coach-supervised PAPs based on RCT programs tend to be more effective. Our results prove the short and medium-term beneficial effect on health of PAP in the workplace based on rigorous methodology such as RCTs. Management's support through work organization and the follow-up of actions in the long term are an essential factor for adherence to these programs. Finally, we suggest what this literature review contributes for future research or entrepreneurial and/or political projects. In fine, new models of working time will have to be considered.",Rowe F; Fleury-Bahi G,IAE Nantes; UR 4638-LPPL,dominique.tripodi@chu-nantes.fr.

A good team climate, the relational processes of team working, can mitigate pressured work environments, but little is known about it. To explore factors associated with more favourable team climates in general practices and investigate associations between team climate and outcomes for staff and practice performance. All 6475 general practices in England were eligible to take part in an online cross-sectional survey. Clinical and non-clinical staff in practices were invited to participate. Data were gathered using the 14 item version of the Team Climate Inventory; analysis was conducted on 10 items because piloting indicated many participants could not answer four items about practice objectives. Secondary outcomes included single item measures of job satisfaction, intention to remain working in the practice and burnout. Practice performance measures were: attainment in the Quality and Outcomes pay-for-performance system (for clinical effectiveness) and patient experience ratings from the national General Practice Patient Survey. Staff outcomes were analysed, principally by role. Practices in which over 50% of staff participated were included in modelling of practice level outcomes. A total of 9835 individual members of staff from 809 practices participated. Most indicated a favourable team climate in their practice, (mean 3.77, on scale 1-5 best, SD 0.84); 61.3% stated they were mostly or extremely satisfied in their jobs; 26.1% met the criteria for high burnout. General Practitioners, compared to other clinical and non-clinical staff, perceived team climate to be better, and reported less likelihood of leaving, yet lower job satisfaction and higher burnout. In practice-level modelling, team climate improved as practice size decreased. Staff outcomes (job satisfaction, likelihood of remaining in post, less burnout) were associated with a better practice team climate, as were patient experience ratings. Higher GP to patient ratios were associated with improved job satisfaction, less burnout and more favourable patient experience ratings. Policies focussed on improving team climate could improve staff outcomes and contribute to mitigating the workforce crisis in general practice in England. Guidance on fostering good team climates is needed for practices.",Brady P; Chilvers R,Tangerine Bee; Chair of GP Teams Project Service Users Panel,b.e.jones@surrey.ac.uk.

The reversed halo sign (RHS) is a computed tomography (CT) finding that is commonly observed in diseases such as cryptogenic organizing pneumonia, invasive fungal infections, tuberculosis, sarcoidosis, and pulmonary thromboembolism, but has seldom been described in association with psittacosis pneumonia. We report a case in which a 26-year-old man with a history of close contact with pigeons and chicken manure presented with fever and cough for 6 days. A CT examination revealed the RHS in the right lower lobe of the lung. Psittacosis pneumonia was diagnosed by metagenomic next-generation sequencing of the patient's bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. Treatment with omadacycline abolished his symptoms. We also discuss six other cases of psittacosis pneumonia with the RHS identified by literature search. When clinicians encounter patients with atypical pneumonia with the RHS and a history of contact with poultry, psittacosis should be considered.",,,zhouhua1@zju.edu.cn.

However, long-term survivors (≥5 years post-treatment, disease-free) face persistent physical, psychological, and social challenges requiring tailored, evidence-based care. Despite the growing survivor population, no systematic evaluation of Clinical Practice Guidelines (CPGs) for this group has been conducted. This study assesses the quality of CPGs and their evidence-based recommendations. A systematic review was conducted in PubMed, CINAHL, and Cochrane Library (2015-2023), including guidelines from major oncology organisations. The AGREE II instrument evaluated CPG quality across six domains, and recommendations were classified using a Primary Care survivorship framework: prevention, surveillance, care coordination, and long-term effect management. Ten CPGs met inclusion criteria, with 7 classified as high quality. Most recommendations focused on prevention (adjuvant therapy, alcohol) and surveillance (follow-up, mammography), while gaps remained in lifestyle guidance, psychosocial support, and management of complications (lymphedema, osteoporosis, cognitive dysfunction). Care coordination and psychosocial interventions were inconsistently addressed. Current CPGs inadequately cover the complex needs of long-term survivors, particularly in psychosocial care.

Bacteriophage (phage) therapy is one of the most promising alternative strategies that can be implemented to combat multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacterial infections. Herein, an A. baumannii phage VB_AB_Acb75 that exhibited lytic activity against 6 CRAB isolates (21.43%) with stability at up to 70 °C, pH 2-12, and high concentrations of organic solvents was isolated and characterized. The transmission electron microscope (TEM) detected a tailed phage with an icosahedral head and contractile tail (myoviral morphotype). The Oxford nanopore sequencing results showed an A. baumannii phage genome size of 45,487 bp, a G + C content of 38%, and 42 open reading frames (ORFs). The phylogenetic analysis, ORF, and TEM analysis indicated that A. baumannii phage VB_AB_Acb75 belongs to a novel species in the Obolenskvirus genus. Furthermore, the phage-loaded Carbopol 940 hydrogel was preclinically evaluated for wound healing effectiveness in the burn-wound animal model infected with the CRAB isolate. The histology findings showed a marked improvement in wound healing through a thick epidermal layer and the formation of well-organized fibrous connective tissue covered by a scab at the site of injury, as well as the ability to eliminate CRAB infection, as compared to the control group. In conclusion, based on in vitro, physicochemical properties, and preclinical findings, the phage-loaded hydrogel is expected to be a promising candidate for clinical evaluation against CRAB-associated skin infections.",,,aboshanab2012@pharma.asu.edu.eg.

In today's hospitals, care is provided by multidisciplinary and multiprofessional teams. To conduct an effective and efficient ward round, active patient involvement is essential, and the input from all team members must be shared and integrated into the diagnostic and therapeutic plan. The organization and structure of ward rounds, the roles and responsibilities of participants, the preparation before the round, and the communication rules must be clearly defined. Successful ward rounds require a focused, explicitly structured, patient-centered communication, and a balanced interprofessional information exchange. Bedside interprofessional ward rounds preceded by a discussion of the patient's condition and clinical course outside the room appear to optimally support comprehensive, collaborative patient-centered care, while fostering alignment within the interprofessional healthcare team.

Conversely, non-IgM secreting LPL are rare. As part of the 12th International Workshop on WM (IWWM-12), a consensus panel of experts was tasked to develop recommendations for the management and response assessment of non-IgM LPL. The panel considered that in view of available molecular, pathological and clinical data, non-IgM LPL should be considered as a separate sub-entity of LPL. The panel further recommended that the IWWM-2 consensus criteria used for IgM LPL (WM) treatment initiation, should also be used for non-IgM LPL and be independent of IgG or IgA paraprotein level unless symptomatic hyperviscosity is present. The panel agreed that based on current evidence, there is insufficient data to support a different clinical management for non-IgM vs IgM (WM) LPL. Moreover, the panel advised that patients with non-IgM LPL should be treated in a similar manner to patients with IgM LPL independent of MYD88 mutation status until more is known about its impact on treatment outcomes for non-IgM LPL patients. The panel therefore recommends the use of the IWWM-11 IgM LPL (WM) response criteria for cases of non-IgM LPL with a monoclonal IgA or IgG paraprotein component, but creating a specific panel to develop formal response criteria for this LPL subset was also recommended.",Autore F; Seymour JF; Varettoni M,Fondazione Policlinico Universitario A.

This research analyzed stroke epidemiological trends from 1990-2021. The Global Burden of Disease database provided stroke data including incidence, mortality, and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs). Age-standardized rates (ASRs) and Estimated Annual Percent Changes (EAPC) measured incidence and mortality shifts. The sociodemographic index (SDI) was explored alongside stroke burden. Forecasting of stroke trends until 2035 utilized the Bayesian age-period-cohort (BAPC) model. The factors influencing the variability of stroke burden were subjected to decomposition analysis for a more in-depth examination. Additionally, frontier analysis was employed to visually illustrate the opportunities for alleviating burden in each nation or region, taking into account their respective stages of development.This study utilized the slope index of inequality (SII) and the concentration index, as defined by the World Health Organization (WHO), to assess absolute and relative inequalities in disease burden. From 1990-2021, global stroke incidence increased by 15.03%, with an overall decline in age-standardized incidence rate (ASIR). Lower in females than males, the incidence rise was larger in females. Stroke mortality declined by 2.60% overall, with a rise in male mortality and decrease in female mortality. DALYs increased, with a 10.67% decline by rate per 100,000 people. Eastern Europe, Central Asia, and East Asia experienced the highest incidence rates, with the greatest ASIR decline in the high-income Asia Pacific region. The decomposition analysis revealed a notable rise in Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) within the middle Socio-Demographic Index (SDI) quintile region, where factors such as aging and population growth were identified as primary contributing elements. Additionally, the frontier analysis indicated that nations or regions categorized within higher SDI quintiles are likely to exhibit greater potential for improvement. Projections for 2035 anticipate increased stroke cases alongside further ASIR and ASMR declines. Cross-country inequality analysis suggests that both absolute and relative health inequalities associated with the stroke burden have escalated during the period from 1990 to 2021. Despite rising global stroke incidence and DALYs, decreases were seen in ASIR and ASMR since 1990. Incidence rates increased most quickly in females, with regional variation observable. High systolic blood pressure remained a key risk factor. Future efforts should target prevention and treatment to mitigate sex, age, and regional stroke disparities.",,,1216430643@qq.com.

Whether patients with treatment-resistant depression (TRD) or severe depression have an even higher risk is uncertain. Patients 18-75 years old with a depressive episode in specialized psychiatric care were identified using national Swedish registers. Patients with depression were matched with population comparators, patients with TRD with non-TRD comparators, and severe depression with non-severe depression comparators. The primary outcome was MACE, including acute myocardial infarction, stroke, heart failure, and cardiovascular death. Hazard ratios were calculated, adjusting for sociodemographic and clinical covariates. We identified 143,731 patients with depression, including 23,335 with TRD and 45,217 with severe depression. Patients with depression had a higher hazard of MACE vs comparators (aHR 1.50, 95%CI 1.40-1.62). Hazards of MACE were overall similar in patients with TRD vs comparators (aHR 1.06, 95%CI 0.93-1.22) and severe depression vs comparators (aHR 1.04, 95%CI 0.96-1.13). Analyzing separate outcomes, patients with TRD had a higher hazard of cardiovascular death (aHR 1.32, 95 % CI 1.03-1.69). Stratified by age, there was an elevated hazard of MACE among patients 18-29 years old with severe depression (aHR 2.82, 95%CI 1.24-6.41).

Cancer imposes substantial economic and mental challenges on patients and their families and strains healthcare systems. Depression, one of the most prevalent mental health conditions, affects approximately 3.8% of the global population and is a significant global health challenge. Research indicates increasing incidence rates of depression among patients with cancer. Depression also appears to influence cancer development and progression, worsening patient prognosis and quality of life, thereby creating additional challenges for clinical treatment. Correlation of depression and cancer is a complicated yet promising field with fast-paced progression and vital clinical values. Therefore, we discussed in this review the associations between depression and cancer and their potential mechanisms by analyzing the specific role of depression in the development and progression of tumors from the perspective of suppressing tumor immunity, inhibiting tumor cell apoptosis, inducing DNA damage, promoting tumor cell mesenchymal transition, enhancing tumor cell stemness, and promoting tumor angiogenesis. This review also discusses how tumors influence the development of depression via inflammatory factors and the significance of identifying and treating depression to enhance the quality of life and prognosis of patients with cancer. Promising biomarkers and effective treatments are also highlighted. Despite available data, limited research exists on how treating depression affects cancer prognosis, and whether timely treatment can reduce cancer risk remains unclear, which necessitates further investigation. This review summarizes the molecular mechanisms involved in the relationship between cancer and depression to help identify new biomarkers and provide precise medical care for patients with depression.

This qualitative descriptive study explored the perspectives of blood and marrow transplant (BMT) specialist nurses and physicians, and General Practitioners (GPs) regarding the long-term management and follow-up care of BMT survivors. Semi-structured online interviews were conducted with thirteen purposefully selected BMT Physicians (n = 4), Advanced Practice Nurses (APNs) (n = 6) and GPs (n = 3), experienced in providing long-term care to BMT survivors. Data were analysed using thematic analysis. Both specialist and community-based practitioners identified deficiencies in models of care delivery and in the organisation of long-term care for BMT survivors, particularly in relation to communication, transition and personalisation of care. Two themes were identified that explored (1) Efficiency and quality of current care provision for BMT survivors and (2) Characteristics of optimal care. All participants recognised the need for flexible, patient-centred models of shared care that bring together hospital and community-based healthcare professionals in providing optimal care to BMT survivors. The growing population of survivors of BMT requires an urgent re-evaluation of healthcare models to address their complex long-term care needs. This will require a well-trained primary care-based workforce supported by collaborative relationships with specialist centres and easy access to essential information. Current approaches to post-BMT care that limit provision of care to specialist BMT services are unsustainable, inefficient, and do not support the transition of patients from tertiary to community healthcare services.",,,gmcerlean@uow.edu.au.

Artificial intelligence-based software has been developed to reduce the number of missed or misdiagnosed lung nodules on computed tomography images.  To assess the accuracy, clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of using  software with artificial intelligence-derived algorithms to assist in the detection and analysis of lung nodules in computed tomography scans of the chest compared with unassisted reading. Systematic review and de novo cost-effectiveness analysis. Searches were undertaken from 2012 to January 2022. Company submissions were accepted until 31 August 2022. Study quality was assessed using the revised tool for the quality assessment of diagnostic accuracy studies (QUADAS-2), the extension to QUADAS-2 for assessing risk of bias in comparative accuracy studies (QUADAS-C) and the COnsensus-based Standards for the selection of health status Measurement INstruments (COSMIN) checklist. Outcomes were synthesised narratively. Two decision trees were used for cost-effectiveness: (1) a simple decision tree for the detection of actionable nodules and (2) a decision tree reflecting the full clinical pathways for people undergoing chest computed tomography scans. Models estimated incremental cost-effectiveness ratios, cost per correct detection of an actionable nodule, and cost per cancer detected and treated. We undertook scenario and sensitivity analyses. Twenty-seven studies were included. All were rated as being at high risk of bias. Twenty-four of the included studies used retrospective data sets. Seventeen compared readers with and without artificial intelligence software. One reported prospective screening experiences before and after artificial intelligence software implementation. The remaining studies either evaluated stand-alone artificial intelligence or provided only non-comparative evidence. (1) Artificial intelligence assistance generally improved the detection of any nodules compared with unaided reading (three studies; average per-person sensitivity 0.43-0.68 for unaided and 0.79-0.99 for artificial intelligence-assisted reading), with similar or lower specificity (three studies; 0.77-1.00 for unaided and 0.81-0.97 for artificial intelligence-assisted reading). Nodule diameters were similar or significantly larger with semiautomatic measurements than with manual measurements. Intra-reader and inter-reader agreement in nodule size measurement and in risk classification generally improved with artificial intelligence assistance or were comparable to those with unaided reading. However, the effect on measurement accuracy is unclear. (2) Radiologist reading time generally decreased with artificial intelligence assistance in research settings. (3) Artificial intelligence assistance tended to increase allocated risk categories as defined by clinical guidelines. (4) No relevant clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness studies were identified. (5) The de novo cost-effectiveness analysis suggested that for symptomatic and incidental populations, artificial intelligence-assisted computed tomography image analysis dominated the unaided radiologist in cost per correct detection of an actionable nodule. However, when relevant costs and quality-adjusted life-years from the full clinical pathway were included, artificial intelligence-assisted computed tomography reading was dominated by the unaided reader. For screening, artificial intelligence-assisted computed tomography image analysis was cost-effective in the base case and all sensitivity and scenario analyses. Due to the heterogeneity, sparseness, low quality and low applicability of the clinical effectiveness evidence and the major challenges in linking test accuracy evidence to clinical and economic outcomes, the findings presented here are highly uncertain and provide indicators/frameworks for future assessment. Artificial intelligence-assisted analysis of computed tomography scan images may reduce variability of and improve consistency in the measurement and clinical management of lung nodules. Artificial intelligence may increase nodule and cancer detection but may also increase the number of patients undergoing computed tomography surveillance unnecessarily. No direct comparative evidence was found, and nor was any direct evidence found on clinical outcomes and cost-effectiveness. Artificial intelligence-assisted image analysis may be cost-effective in screening for lung cancer but not for symptomatic populations. However, reliable estimates of cost-effectiveness cannot be obtained with current evidence. This study is registered as PROSPERO CRD42021298449. This award was funded by the National Institute for Health and Care Research (NIHR) Evidence Synthesis programme (NIHR award ref: NIHR135325) and is published in full in  Lung cancer is one of the most common types of cancer in the UK. In the early stages, people may not have symptoms and so lung cancer is often diagnosed late. Identifying and monitoring lung nodules using computed tomography scans are the primary means of detecting lung cancer at earlier stages. If a nodule is found, it needs to be measured accurately so that the cancer risk can be assessed. Currently, images from computed tomography scans are interpreted without artificial intelligence software. Artificial intelligence could help to detect and measure nodules more accurately and quickly. This report looks at the evidence on the benefits and harms of artificial intelligence in helping healthcare professionals to find and measure lung nodules. The report also looks at whether artificial intelligence offers value for money. We did not find any studies that directly compared radiologists' performance with and without the help of artificial intelligence in the UK. All of the studies we did find were of low quality. Findings from these studies suggest pros and cons of using artificial intelligence: Artificial intelligence could improve nodule detection, with bigger improvements seen in detecting smaller nodules. However, artificial intelligence might increase the detection of both cancer as well as harmless nodules. With artificial intelligence, measuring nodule size and assessing cancer risk could be more consistent. In up to half of nodules, automatic size measurement needs manual adjustment. Radiologists’ reading time could be reduced with artificial intelligence. It has not yet been established how artificial intelligence would affect radiologists’ performance in United Kingdom practice. Whether artificial intelligence offers good value for money is also uncertain because we lack good evidence. Our early assessment suggests that artificial intelligence software might be cost-effective for lung cancer screening but might not be cost-effective for people who have symptoms or who have a computed tomography scan for other reasons. This is because the balance between the benefit of detecting more cancers and the harm of worrying people with incorrect test results and adding unnecessary regular follow-ups may be different in different populations.",,,

Searches for systematic reviews, randomised controlled trials and cost-utility studies were conducted in May 2023. Sources included MEDLINE, Epistemonikos, EMBASE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, the Cost-effectiveness Analysis Registry and reference checking. Eligible studies included people (≥ 16 years) making initial contact with the health system with symptoms suggestive of acute respiratory infection. Risk of bias in randomised controlled trials was assessed using the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool. The Drummond checklist was used for cost-utility studies. Meta-analyses of clinical outcomes were conducted to estimate summary risk ratios with 95% confidence intervals. Study characteristics and main results were summarised narratively and tabulated. Fourteen randomised controlled trials were included; all had a high risk of bias. Ten randomised controlled trials analysed point-of-care tests for C-reactive protein. Compared with usual care, the effects on hospital admissions and mortality were highly uncertain due to sparse data. Three randomised controlled trials had heterogeneous findings on the resolution of symptoms/time to full recovery. The risk of re-consultations increased in patients receiving C-reactive protein point-of-care tests (pooled risk ratio 1.61, 95% confidence interval 1.07 to 2.41; four studies). There was a reduction in antibiotics initially prescribed (C-reactive protein point-of-care tests vs. usual care: pooled risk ratio 0.75, 95% confidence interval 0.68 to 0.84; nine studies). The effects of procalcitonin point-of-care tests compared with usual care on hospital admission, escalation of care, and duration of symptoms were very uncertain as only one randomised controlled trial was included. The study found a large reduction in antibiotic prescriptions within 7 days. Two studies revealed a large reduction in initial antibiotic prescriptions for Group A streptococcus point-of-care tests versus usual care. Only one study compared an influenza point-of-care test with usual care. The effect of the antibiotics prescribed was very uncertain. No deaths occurred in either treatment group. Six of the 17 included cost-utility studies were judged to be directly applicable to our review, 4 of which focused on the C-reactive protein point-of-care test. The results suggested that the C-reactive protein point-of-care test is potentially cost-effective; these studies were generally limited to capturing only short-term costs and consequences. One study evaluated 14 different point-of-care tests for Group A streptococcus; none were cost-effective compared with usual care. A further study evaluated two rapid tests (Quidel for influenza [Quidel Corp, San Diego, CA, USA], and BinaxNOW [Binax, Inc., Portland, ME, USA]) for the pneumococcal antigen) compared to culture/serology and found that they were not cost-effective. Rapid synthesis methods were used, so relevant studies may have been missed. No evidence was identified for several review questions. C-reactive protein point-of-care test may reduce the number of patients given an antibiotic prescription but could increase the rate of re-consultations. C-reactive protein point-of-care test may potentially be cost-effective but existing estimates were based on very small and uncertain gains in quality-adjusted life-years and only accounted for short-term costs and consequences. There was very limited or an absence of evidence for other point-of-care tests. Research is needed to explore the impact of point-of-care tests on triaging decisions across different clinical settings and to quantify the longer-term health and cost consequences.

This award was funded by the National Institute for Health and Care Research (NIHR) Evidence Synthesis programme (NIHR award ref: NIHR159946) and is published in full in  Acute respiratory infection is a group of common diseases caused by viruses or bacteria. Examples of acute respiratory infections include ‘cold’ and flu. When people consult a doctor (or other healthcare professionals) for suspected acute respiratory infection, it is not always easy for the doctor to identify what is causing the symptoms. The doctor also needs to assess whether the patient’s condition is serious or may become serious. Laboratory tests can provide useful information to help the doctor decide what to do next, but it takes several hours or days to get the test results back. This delay means the doctor cannot use the test results to make a decision while seeing the patient. Rapid tests that can be done and produce results quickly (within 45 minutes) are now available. It is currently unclear whether the use of these rapid tests to assess patients would improve or worsen patient outcomes or increase or decrease costs overall. We conducted a rapid review (i.e. using systematic but streamlined methods to improve efficiency) of the literature to summarise the best available published evidence to help answer these questions. We found that rapid tests for C-reactive protein (a substance that tends to increase in our blood when we have inflammation caused by an infection or other conditions) may reduce the perceived need for doctors to prescribe antibiotics, but the number of patients who come back to see the doctor again may increase. There is still some uncertainty in this evidence. Our review found that the test may represent good value for money, but the studies were limited as they only considered costs and health implications in the short term. Evidence either is very limited to draw conclusions or did not indicate good value for money for the other rapid tests that we evaluated.",Colquitt J; Whiter F; Loveman E,Effective Evidence LLP; Freelance reviewer for Effectiveness Evidence LLP,

Reusable instruments are often packaged in trays, which accumulate instruments over time. This review quantifies the advantages of tray optimization (removing redundant instruments), including reduced environmental impact, costs, operating room and processing time. Following PRISMA guidelines, searches were conducted in PubMed, Embase, Web of Science and The Cochrane Library in August 2024 for studies on optimizing surgical trays in human surgeries. Studies were included if they reported on optimization approaches and outcomes related to environmental, economic or efficiency improvements. Exclusions included studies on disposable instruments, animal or veterinary research and patient-specific trays. Risk of bias was assessed using the ROBINS-I (Risk Of Bias In Non-randomised Studies - of Interventions) tool. The search identified 4511 studies, with 45 meeting the inclusion criteria. Half of the studies showed a serious risk of bias, while the rest had a moderate risk. Three main optimization strategies were identified, with expert analysis being the most common (n = 29), followed by mathematical modelling. Environmental benefits were reported in all three included studies, although limited in number. Studies reported that 19 to 89% of instruments could be removed from trays, with 31 studies unanimously reporting cost reductions. Additionally, 17 studies demonstrated improved operational efficiency. Tray optimization strategies effectively reduce resource use, resulting in environmental and economic benefits. Although no standard method exists, effective strategies such as procedure observation and clinician feedback may eliminate over half of the instruments, offering a significant opportunity to minimize resource consumption in the operating room.",,,

We collaborated with five research networks, representing various data approaches and workflows, to generalize an established data quality checking and report generation tool so it could be implemented more easily by other research consortia. The resulting approach reduced the need for technical expertise at user sites by leveraging the REDCap data collection software to store details about a research group, their data model, and expectations about variables (e.g., plausible numeric range, valid format and codes, date logic). The application then used the REDCap API to retrieve those details and assess a dataset's conformance to the data model, logical consistency, and completeness. Users could download reports that summarized the dataset contents and quality. The generalized Harmonist Data Toolkit was built using the freely available REDCap and R/Shiny platforms, with code available on GitHub.

The WHO endorsed using ivermectin with diethylcarbamazine and albendazole (IDA) for MDA in specific settings devoid of onchocerciasis or loiasis. Still, the utilization of IDA in sub-Saharan Africa is restricted due to the potential of diethylcarbamazine to induce severe adverse ocular events in individuals with onchocerciasis. We aim to investigate all documented combinations of antifilarial drugs available in the literature using a network meta-analysis (NWM) design, focusing specifically on the treatment of Lymphatic Filariasis (LF). A meticulous search was conducted across four electronic databases to identify pertinent studies. Subsequently, a frequentist NWM was executed. Risk ratios (RRs) served as the effect size metric for categorical outcomes, each with a 95% confidence interval (CI). Our study encompassed 45 studies, including 61,369 patients. At six months, multiple doses of diethylcarbamazine plus albendazole (multiple DA) regimens demonstrated superior efficacy in reducing microfilaremia compared to a single intake of DA, diethylcarbamazine, ivermectin, and albendazole with RR and CI as follows: 0.37 [0.19; 0.72], 0.35 [0.17; 0.69], 0.30 [0.14; 0.64], and 0.28 [0.13; 0.57].

By the twelfth month, diethylcarbamazine, followed by albendazole, ranked superior to IDA and DA: 0.12 [0.02; 0.89] and 0.11 [0.01; 0.79], respectively. At 24 months, no significant differences were found among the assessed drugs in reducing microfilaremia. The comparisons revealed no significant differences between the drug combinations we studied regarding safety and adverse events. Multiple doses of the DA regimen showed superior efficacy in reducing microfilaremia compared to combinations involving IA, diethylcarbamazine, ivermectin, and albendazole at six and twelve months.

From January 2020 to December 2022, 158 patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) were admitted to our hospital and chosen as the study subjects. Their clinical data were analyzed retrospectively and organized into a control group (n = 78, received SCRT) and an observation group (n = 80, received CCRT). Lesion sizes measured through CT scans were used to compare the clinical efficacy between the two groups. The study also compared the rates of adverse reactions, radiation pneumonitis, and lung function pre- and post-treatment, including forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), forced vital capacity (FVC), and FEV1/FVC ratio. The comparison of serum tumor marker levels was conducted between two groups, with patients being observed over a 36-month period. Kaplan-Meier survival curves were used to analyze the changes in overall survival rate (OSR), progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS) between two groups of patients. For the observation group, the remission rate was 90.00%, and for the control group, it was 74.36%. The control rates were 96.25% for the observation group and 89.74% for the control group. Significantly higher remission and control rates were observed in the observation group than in the control group (P < 0.05). The hemoglobin reduction grade 0 was 81.2% in the observation group, compared to 58.9% in the control group. In terms of leukopenia reduction (grades 0-III) and hemoglobin reduction (grades 0-II), the observation group outperformed the control group (P < 0.05). In the observation group, 25.00% of patients experienced radiation pneumonitis, a higher rate compared to the 8.97% in the control group (P < 0.05). Overall, the control group experienced more severe radiation-induced lung injury compared to the observation group, with 6.41% of cases reaching grade IV, unlike the 0.00% in the observation group. Grade II accounted for 1.28% in the control group, a figure significantly lower than the 21.25% in the observation group (P < 0.05). Post-treatment, the FEV1, FVC, and FEV1/FVC values rose in both groups, with the observation group displaying significantly greater increases than the control group (P < 0.05). Also, after treatment, there was a decrease in CA125, SCC Ag, and CYFRA21-1 levels in both groups, with the observation group having significantly lower levels than the control group (P < 0.05). According to the Kaplan-Meier survival curve analysis, the observation group achieved an OSR of 90.00%, which exceeded the 83.33% of the control group (P > 0.05). Furthermore, PFS and OS levels were elevated in the observation group relative to the control group (P < 0.05). CCRT could optimize the treatment effect for NSCLC patients by improving lung function, reducing serum tumor marker levels, and prolonging survival without increasing toxicity. Nonetheless, the occurrence of radiation pneumonitis was somewhat above expectations, and the treatment plan should be tailored to the patient's specific circumstances in clinical practice.",,,fengyuncdc@21cn.com.

In the base-case analysis, T-DXd yielded 3.59 QALYs for $261,315, while T-DM1 yielded 1.89 QALYs at $258,039, resulting in an ICER of $1,927 per QALY. This value is below Iran's WTP threshold of $2413/QALY. One-way sensitivity analysis identified the unit price of T-DXd as the most influential parameter. PSA results indicated that T-DXd has a 52% probability of being cost-effective. T-DXd represents a cost-effective alternative to T-DM1 as a second-line treatment for HER2-positive MBC in Iran. Its clinical advantages, combined with an ICER below the local WTP threshold, support its adoption in this patient population.",,,sohrezaei64@gmail.com.

This study explores experiences of caregivers' of persons with DS with the diagnostic odyssey and their perception of its consequences for DS patients. 106 family caregivers connected with the Association for People with Severe Refractory Epilepsy DRAVET.PL completed an anonymised, self-administered, computer-assisted online survey on parents' experiences of the diagnostic journey conducted from March to June 2024. Although 96.2% of DS parents reported that their children experienced initial symptoms in the first year of life, 58.4% indicated that it took more than a year before DS was diagnosed and 72.7% reported that their DS child received at least one misdiagnosis. While 6.6% of patients were diagnosed by the first doctor consulted, 65.1% had to consult between two and four specialists and 22.8% consulted more than five specialists. 19.8% of parents confirmed that they sought diagnosis abroad. 58.4% of DS parents suggested that delayed diagnosis was harmful to their children's health. Many believed that it resulted in taking unnecessary or inappropriate medications (67%), hospitalisations (32.1%), or medical interventions (15.1%). Many parents reported problems with accessing genetic counselling and psychological support. Since DS parents report the multifaceted and protracted diagnostic journey in their children, underscoring the duration of the diagnostic process, numerous misdiagnoses and the number of healthcare professionals involved in achieving the confirmed DS diagnosis, this study highlights the need for widespread access to genetic testing, which usually concludes the diagnostic odyssey and is crucial for managing the proper treatment plan for DS patients. It also shows the need to increase general practitioners' awareness of the developmental and epileptic encephalopathy (DEE) and the creation of more rapid and transparent referral procedures for children with DEE.",,,jandomar@ump.edu.pl.

The 15-method, a three-step opportunistic screening and treatment tool premised on Motivational Interviewing and integrated within the Screening, Brief Intervention and Referral to Treatment framework, offers a structured approach for healthcare professionals to identify and treat alcohol-related problems. The present study aimed to assess healthcare professionals' perceptions of determinants for early-stage implementation of the 15-method in Danish general practice and to classify these determinants using the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR). This qualitative study involved individual interviews and group interviews with general practitioners and nurses (N = 28) from 12 general practices participating in the Identification and Treatment of Alcohol Problems in Primary Care (iTAPP) study, a stepped-wedge cluster randomized controlled trial evaluating the effectiveness of the 15-method in Danish general practice. Interviews were semi-structured, guided by the CFIR framework, and analyzed using directed content analysis. Determinants were rated for their influence on implementation. Key facilitators included the 15-method's adaptability, strong evidence base, relative advantage, and compatibility with existing practices. Barriers included structural characteristics in the practices and local conditions. A central finding revealed a tension between patients' motivation and healthcare professionals' opportunities and capabilities to deliver the 15-method. Mixed determinants highlighted the complexity of implementing the 15-method across diverse practices. Implementing the 15-method in Danish general practice is feasible but requires addressing specific barriers and leveraging facilitators. A multifaceted implementation strategy tailored to individual practices may be necessary to address the variations in contexts and resources across different practices with an emphasis on increasing healthcare professionals' capabilities and opportunities to deliver the intervention.",,,pscholer@health.sdu.dk.

However, there is limited research on this issue in low- and middle-income countries like India. The present study examines the specific stressors associated with the operational demands and organizational structures experienced by police officers in the state of Kerala, India. A survey was conducted among police officials working in randomly selected police stations located in the Thiruvananthapuram district, Kerala. We used the level of occupational and organizational stress using the police stress questionnaire. Both bivariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were employed to determine the factors that were associated with higher stress levels. The findings indicated that 75.5% of participants experienced high operational stress and 65.6% experienced high organizational stress. Age was significantly associated with operational stress, with participants in the higher age group reporting higher levels of stress(odds ratio (OR): 2.20, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.05-4.59). Participants with lower physical activity levelshad a higher likelihood of experiencing operational stress (OR: 7.07; CI: 2.85-17.50) and organizational stress (OR: 2.77, 95% CI: 1.38-5.59) compared to their more active counterparts. The use of alcohol or tobacco was found to be the highest associated factor with operational (OR: 14.58, CI:4.19-50.7) and organizational stress (OR: 27.45, CI:8.01-94.03). Having diabetes or hypertension was also significantly associated with a high level of operational stress (OR: 2.97, CI: 1.32-6.60) and organizational stress (OR: 4.16; CI: 2.02-8.57). The study highlights factors associated with higher stress levels, including physical inactivity, alcohol or tobacco use, and morbidity, that require targeted interventions to enhance the mental and physical health of police officers. Based on the findings of the study, the researchers proposesuitable intervention programs in this population.

A community-based complex intervention was implemented at the health posts of four agrarian regions of Ethiopia from 2017 to 2018 to improve the coverage and utilization of quality child health services. This study aimed to examine the implementation status of child health care quality improvement interventions in program areas of Oromia region, Ethiopia. A case study design using quantitative and qualitative research methods was conducted from September to October 2018. Implementation data were collected using observations, document reviews, and program staff interviews. Program staffs including health extension workers and their supervisors were included in surveys, and purposefully selected key informants from health posts to zonal health office level were included in the qualitative component of the research. The analysis framework was focused on the fidelity of the interventions' content, frequency, duration, and coverage, as well as the potential moderating factors of implementation using the model proposed by Carroll et al. conceptual framework for implementation fidelity. Performance Review Clinical Mentoring was implemented according to the plan (every 6 months) in all of the districts and around nine in ten (88%) of the core contents were implemented. Though mentoring was provided by trained mentors, the duration of mentoring was less than the plan to fully implement all of the core activities. Overall, the mentoring program has reached 88% of health extension workers. Slightly greater than three-fourths of health extension workers have been supervised (76%) according to the plan and 80% of health posts were supplied with required iCCM medicines regularly. Staff turnover, topographical challenges, lack of transportation, competing priorities, weak support and feedback from the District health office, and security problems were frequently mentioned challenges to implementation. Whereas, the existence of continual partner support, the presence of integration and coordination of activities, and changes observed were the facilitators of implementation. The implementation status of the Performance Review Clinical Mentoring Meeting was sufficient, while moderate adherence was observed in supportive supervision and supply of medicines. All of the providers were reached with sick children management training. Therefore, the implementation of community-based interventions should be aware of operational challenges in order to improve and sustain the program's performance.",,,dawit.daka86520@gmail.com.

However, many studies have been limited due to small sample size and inclusion of only one facility. Using a nationwide cohort of hospitalized patients in the Veterans Affairs (VA) Healthcare System, we conducted a retrospective, 1:3 matched case-control study of patients with CDI due to the ribotype 027 strain versus non-027 strains from October 1, 2008, to September 30, 2020. Controls were matched to cases by health care facility and year of diagnosis. Multivariate logistic regression was used to identify risk factors for CDI due to the 027 strain. A total of 3,353 cases were matched to 10,059 controls in 84 VA facilities. CDI due to the ribotype 027 strain was independently associated with prior macrolide or fluoroquinolone exposure, decreased functional capability, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus nasal colonization, age >65 years, white blood cell count >11,000 cells/mm Antimicrobial stewardship interventions focused on fluoroquinolones and macrolides could be beneficial in reducing the risk for infection due to the ribotype 027 C. difficile strain.

The extent of HBV direct impact on liver transcriptome remains controversial. Transcriptional activation in eukaryotic cells is tightly linked with disruption of nucleosome organization at accessible genomic sites of remodeled chromatin. We sought to investigate the impact of HBV on chromatin accessibility and transcription. We used ATAC-seq (Assay for Transposase Accessible Chromatin followed by high throughput sequencing) to detect early changes in chromatin accessibility coupled with RNA-seq in HBV-infected Primary Human Hepatocytes (PHHs). An increasing number of genomic sites change their nucleosome organization over time after HBV infection, with a prevalent, but not exclusive, reduction of chromatin accessibility at specific sites that is partially prevented by inhibiting HBV transcription and replication. ATAC-seq and RNA-seq integration showed that HBV infection impacts on liver fatty acids, bile acids, iron metabolism and liver cancer pathways. The upregulation of iron uptake genes leads to a significant increase of iron content in HBV-infected PHHs whereas iron chelation inhibits cccDNA transcription and viral replication. The chromatin accessibility and transcriptional changes imposed by HBV early after infection persist, as an epigenetic scar, in chronic HBV (CHB) patients and in HBV-related HCCs. These changes are to a large extent independent from viral replication levels and disease activity. Altogether our results show that HBV infection impacts on host cell chromatin landscape and specific transcriptional programs including liver metabolism and liver cancer pathways. Re-wiring of iron metabolism boosts viral replication early after infection. The modulation of genes involved in cancer-related pathways may favor the development or the selection of a pro-neoplastic phenotype and persists in HBV-related HCCs.",Alfano V; Cocca M; Paturel A; de Fromentel CC; Merle P; Rivoire M; Levrero M; Guerrieri F,IHU EVEREST - Institut of Hepatology Lyon; INSERM U1052,massimo.levrero@inserm.fr.

Therefore, considering the critical importance of infectious diseases, the present study aims to identify the educational needs of the infectious diseases course in nursing in Iran. This mixed-method study was conducted in two phases. First, a qualitative study using a conventional content analysis approach was performed to identify educational needs. Subsequently, in the quantitative phase, a panel of 10 nursing faculty members was asked to prioritize these needs using the Delphi technique. The qualitative phase identified three main categories of educational needs: (1) enhancing the theoretical content of infectious diseases, (2) strengthening the practical and clinical components of the course, and (3) optimizing educational strategies. The needs assessment questionnaire, developed in the qualitative phase, was analyzed over two rounds using the modified Delphi method with descriptive statistics.

This study aims to examine the relationships among perceived overqualification, covert narcissism, workplace alienation, and role ambiguity among nurses using path analysis to explore their interactions. A cross-sectional study was conducted with 446 nurses from various Egyptian healthcare settings. Data was collected through structured face-to-face interviews using four validated instruments: the Scale of Perceived Overqualification (assessing subjective overqualification), Hypersensitive Narcissism Scale (measuring covert narcissism), Role Ambiguity Scale (evaluating clarity in job responsibilities), Work Alienation Scale (assessing workplace alienation), Additionally, a researcher-developed Demographic Questionnaire was used to collect participants' background characteristics. Path analysis was conducted using AMOS 26.0 to test direct and indirect relationships among variables, with model fit assessed using standard indices. Direct effects revealed that perceived overqualification significantly predicted workplace alienation (B = 0.401, 95% CI [0.311, 0.490], p <.001), covert narcissism (B = 0.430, 95% CI [0.193, 0.423], p <.001), and role ambiguity (B = 0.603, 95% CI [0.150, 0.463], p <.001). Additionally, workplace alienation showed positive direct associations with role ambiguity (B = 0.268, 95% CI [0.195, 0.443], p <.001) and covert narcissism (B = 0.191, 95% CI [0.293, 0.426], p <.001).

Although various behavioral interventions have emerged to reduce ST, the potential of smartphone (SmPh)-based interventions remains relatively unexplored in workplace settings. This study aimed to explore the development, implementation and acceptability of a SmPh application among Indian desk-based office workers. One hundred thirty-six office workers were randomised to one of three interventions for six months: (1) SmPh-based ST and physical activity (PA) reminders (SMART); (2) traditional education (TRADE) and (3) usual work group (CONT). A threshold of 70% adherence (equivalent to responding to at least 580 out of 828 assigned prompts) was used to classify participants as 'compliant'. Of 44 SMART group participants who were assigned to 24 weeks of intervention, nine participants were purposefully selected based on compliance, Moreover, they were interviewed for potential barriers associated with the SmPh application using semi-deductive approach. The SMART STEP application was developed over eight months, during which three versions were created and pilot tested. The cost of application development was reasonable (≈ $1,860). Of 44 participants who received SmPh application-based reminders, 37 completed the two follow-ups at 3rd and 6th month. Mean prompt engagement rates, defined as 'the percentage of prompts participants actively responded to', during the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, and 6th months were 77% (n = 107), 59% (n = 82), 54% (n = 74), 45% (n = 63), 43% (n = 59), and 31% (n = 43), respectively. Barriers such as workload, lack of movement sensing, and insufficient organizational and peer support were key factors contributing to the decline in long-term engagement among office workers. The SMART-STEP application appears to be an affordable and promising solution for reducing ST and promoting PA among office workers in low-resource settings.

Fingolimod, an Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drug for multiple sclerosis, shows bactericidal activity, particularly against Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and biofilm-related infections. With a well-documented safety profile and strong translational potential, it aligns with World Health Organization's goals for antimicrobial repurposing. However, the action mode and mechanism of Fingolimod against gram-positive bacteria remain elusive. This study utilized clinical Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus), Enterococcus faecalis (E. faecalis), Streptococcus agalactiae (S. agalactiae). And their susceptibility to Fingolimod and other antibiotics was tested via Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) assays. Biofilm inhibition and hemolytic activity were evaluated using crystal violet staining, Confocal Laser Scanning Microscopy (CLSM), and hemolysis assays, respectively, while the effect of phospholipids on Fingolimod efficacy was assessed with checkerboard assays. Membrane permeability and integrity were measured using SYTOX green staining and transmission electron microscopy. Whole-genome sequencing was performed on Fingolimod-resistant S. aureus isolates to identify Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) linked to resistance. Our data indicated that Fingolimod exerted bactericidal activity against a wide spectrum of gram-positive bacteria, including S. aureus, E. faecalis, S. agalactiae. Moreover, Fingolimod could significantly eliminate the persisters, inhibit biofilm formation and eradicate in-vitro mature biofilms of S. aureus. The mechanism by which Fingolimod rapidly eradicated S. aureus involved a pH-dependent disruption of bacterial cell permeability and envelope integrity. Concomitantly, exogenous supplementation of phospholipids in the culture medium resulted in a dose-dependent increase in the MIC of Fingolimod. Specifically, the addition of 64 μg/mL of cardiolipin (CL) and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) completely nullified the bactericidal activity of Fingolimod at a concentration of 4 times the MIC. After four months of Fingolimod exposure, the MIC values of S. aureus showed a slight increase, indicating that it is not prone to developing drug resistance. Fingolimod exhibits bactericidal activity against diverse gram-positive bacteria, with remarkable effects on S. aureus (including MRSA), disrupting bacterial cell structural integrity in a pH-dependent way and eradicating biofilms and persisters of S. aureus.",,,wenzw05@163.com.

Closed System Transfer Devices (CSTD) are widely used for the preparation and administration of hazardous drugs. Recent literature has raised concerns about potential under- or over-dosing when doses are prepared using CSTD due to their high hold-up volume. To ensure dose accuracy, it is essential to follow proper preparation methods when using CSTD. Seven commonly used CSTD were evaluated for product transfer accuracy from vials to IV bags using four methods: no bag spike flushing, flushing bag spikes with the original syringes, flushing bag spikes with new syringes, and circle priming. The data confirmed that under- and over-dosing occurred frequently at transfer volume ≤ 2 mL when not flushing bag spikes or flushing bag spikes with the original syringes as suggested by some manufacturers' instructions. The study also demonstrated that flushing bag spikes with the new syringes or using circle priming is effective in enabling accurate volume transfer from vials to IV bags at transfer volumes ≤ 2 mL. Both methods are feasible for implementation in pharmacies or hospitals to ensure dose preparation accuracy using CSTD. It is recommended that clinical sites flush bag spikes with the new syringes or use circle priming method for low volume transfer to ensure dose preparation accuracy. CSTD manufacturers should consider including these methods in their Instructions for Use (IFU).",Liu Q; Chu KP; Cardenas A; Liu X; Liu D; Shameem M; Hu Q,Formulation Development,qingyan.hu@regeneron.com.

Despite its importance, involving residents as primary surgeons is a complex process, influenced by more than just clinical factors. Mentorship, environment, and perceptions play crucial roles. This study aimed to explore rates of residents' involvement in LA, the factors influencing the decision-making, and how surgeons and residents perceive the process. Methods We analyzed data from the REsiDENT-1 trial, covering 653 LA performed between 2019 and 2023 in 24 hospitals affiliated with the University of Milan. Adults with intraoperative acute appendicitis were included. Univariable analysis and multivariable logistic regression explored factors impacting residents' involvement and clinical outcomes. A survey captured the perspectives of surgeons and residents. Results Residents approached 35.9% of the procedures, with longer operative times 67.14 (± 28.1) vs 71.68 (± 24.44), p = 0.001. Trainees were more involved in academic hospitals and emergency surgery units and less complex cases with lower complication rates. Residents' involvement was hampered by patients' complexity in the multivariable analysis. Surgeons prioritized non-technical factors such as punctuality and reliability, whereas residents highlighted clinical complexity as a key consideration for the decision-making of the operator. Both groups agreed that structured feedback systems could improve the educational and training experiences. Conclusion LA remains a crucial procedure for surgical training, balancing hands-on learning with patient safety. Structured mentorship in academic and emergency settings could allow safe resident involvement. Future improvements should focus on clear feedback processes, better access to simulations, and standardized competency-based training to prepare residents for independent practice.",Borghi A; ,; Department of Surgery,stefanopiero.cioffi@uniroma1.it.

We analyzed outcomes for the full sample and subsamples with elevated symptoms at baseline. Although Calm was perceived favorably, there were no significant between-group differences in the full sample (N = 626); differences in subsample analyses demonstrated that while internalizing, externalizing, and trauma symptoms held steady for the Calm group, control participants' symptoms reduced. We generated potential explanations for these results (e.g., interference with youths' natural coping skills or fear extinction) through a focus group with school staff. Given that we found no evidence that calming skills taught via DMHI are effective for Ukrainian youth, we suggest that researchers test other strategies delivered by DMHI and that calming skills continue to be taught in provider-guided formats.",,,joshuasteinberg@g.harvard.edu.

The causes of AD are aging, environmental toxins, and cardiometabolic factors that induce the degeneration of cholinergic neurons. It has been shown that the metabolic syndrome which is a clustering of dissimilar constituents including insulin resistance (IR), glucose intolerance, visceral obesity, hypertension, and dyslipidemia is implicated in the pathogenesis of AD. Metabolic syndrome disapprovingly affects cognitive function and the development in AD by inducing the development of oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, and brain IR. These changes, together with brain IR, impair cerebrovascular reactivity causing cognitive impairment and dementia. Nevertheless, the fundamental mechanism by which metabolic syndrome persuades AD risk is not entirely explicated. Accordingly, this review aims to discuss the connotation between metabolic syndrome and AD. In conclusion, metabolic syndrome is regarded as a possible risk factor for the initiation of AD neuropathology by diverse signaling pathways such as brain IR, activation of inflammatory signaling pathways, neuroinflammation, defective proteostasis, and dysregulation of lipid mediators.",,,drmariospapadakis@gmail.com.

This review traces the development of nonclinical QT evaluation, highlighting key milestones and innovations that have shaped current practices in cardiac safety assessment. The emergence of regulatory guidelines, including International Council for Harmonization of Technical Requirements for Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH) S7B, established a nonclinical framework for evaluating drug effects on cardiac repolarization, addressing concerns raised by drug withdrawals in the 1990s. Advances in in vitro, in vivo, and in silico models have enhanced the predictive accuracy of nonclinical studies, with the hERG assay and telemetry-based animal models becoming gold standards. Recent initiatives, such as the Comprehensive in vitro Proarrhythmia Assay (CiPA) and the Japan iPS Cardiac Safety Assessment (JiCSA), emphasize integrating mechanistic insights from human-derived cardiomyocyte models and computational approaches to refine risk predictions. The 2020s mark a shift toward integrated nonclinical-clinical risk assessments, as exemplified by the ICH E14/S7B Questions and Answers. These highlight the need of best practices for study design, data analysis, and interpretation to support regulatory decision-making. Furthermore, the adoption of New Approach Methodologies (NAMs) and reinforced adherence to 3Rs principles (Reduce, Refine, Replace) reflect a commitment to ethical and innovative safety science. This review underscores the importance of harmonized and translational approaches in cardiac safety evaluation, providing a foundation for advancing drug development while safeguarding patient safety. Future directions include further integration of advanced methodologies and regulatory harmonization to streamline nonclinical and clinical risk assessments.",Delpy E; Bétat AM; Delaunois A; Drieu la Rochelle C; Martel E; Valentin JP,Non-Clinical Department; Department of Drug Discovery Sciences-General Pharmacology; Early Clinical Development & Translational Science,eric.delpy@biotrial.com.
40379823,Enhanced effective convolutional attention network with squeeze-and-excitation inception module for multi-label clinical document classification.,2025-05-16,Scientific reports,10.1038/s41598-025-98719-0,"Clinical Document Classification (CDC) is crucial in healthcare for organizing and categorizing large volumes of medical information, leading to improved patient care, streamlined research, and enhanced administrative efficiency. With the advancement of artificial intelligence, automatic CDC is now achievable through deep learning techniques. While existing research has shown promising results, more effective and accurate classification of long clinical documents is still desired. To address this, we propose a new model called the Enhanced Effective Convolutional Attention Network (EECAN), which incorporates a Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE) Inception module to improve feature representation by adaptively recalibrating channel-wise feature responses. This architecture introduces an Encoder and Attention-Based Clinical Document Classification (EAB-CDC) strategy, which utilizes sum-pooling and multi-layer attention mechanisms to extract salient features from clinical document representations. This study proposes EECAN (Enhanced Effective Convolutional Attention Network) as the overall model architecture and EAB-CDC (Encoder and Attention-Based Clinical Document Classification) as a core strategy conducted in EECAN. EAB-CDC is not a standalone model but a functional part applied to the architecture for discriminative feature extraction by sum-pooling and multi-layer attention mechanisms. With this integrated design, EECAN can transform multi-label clinical texts' general and label-specific contexts without losing information. Our empirical study, conducted on benchmark datasets such as MIMIC-III and MIMIC-III-50, demonstrates that the proposed EECAN model outperforms several existing deep learning approaches, achieving AUC scores of 99.70% and 99.80% using sum-pooling and multi-layer attention, respectively. These results highlight the model's substantial potential for integration into clinical systems, such as Electronic Health Record (EHR) platforms, for the automated classification of clinical texts and improved healthcare decision-making support.",,,krishnareddy_cse@cbit.ac.in.

While fondaparinux sodium, enoxaparin sodium, and dalteparin sodium are commonly used anticoagulants, their safety profiles require further evaluation. This study analyzes their adverse drug events (ADEs) using data from the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS). A retrospective pharmacovigilance study was conducted using FAERS data from Q1 2004 to Q2 2024. Reports identifying fondaparinux sodium, enoxaparin sodium, or dalteparin sodium as the primary suspect drug were extracted. ADEs were classified using MedDRA 23.0 at the System Organ Class (SOC) and Preferred Term (PT) levels. Disproportionality analysis was performed with Reporting Odds Ratio (ROR), Proportional Reporting Ratio (PRR), Bayesian Confidence Propagation Neural Network (BCPNN), and Multi-item Gamma Poisson Shrinker (MGPS). FAERS contained 470 reports for fondaparinux sodium, 1,375 for enoxaparin sodium, and 344 for dalteparin sodium. Most cases involved patients aged ≥ 60, with a female predominance. Hospitalization was the most frequent outcome. Fondaparinux showed the strongest signals for intra-abdominal haematoma (ROR = 374.14, PRR = 371.14), muscle haemorrhage (ROR = 354.91, PRR = 347.04), and retroperitoneal haematoma (ROR = 214.97, PRR = 213.25). Enoxaparin demonstrated notable signals for heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) (ROR = 149.42, PRR = 147.53) and retroperitoneal haemorrhage (ROR = 287.68, PRR = 284.03). Dalteparin showed notable signals for HIT (ROR = 127.88, PRR = 126.49) and retroperitoneal haemorrhage (ROR = 103.23, PRR = 102.75). Distinct ADE profiles were identified among the three anticoagulants, underscoring the need for individualized risk assessment.

Data on incidence, mortality, and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) from 1990 to 2021 were analyzed for 204 countries and territories. Age-standardized rates for incidence (ASIR), mortality (ASMR), and DALYs (ASDR) were calculated, with temporal trends assessed using Joinpoint regression and future projections estimated using the Bayesian Age-Period-Cohort (BAPC) model. Disparities were evaluated using the Socio-Demographic Index (SDI), a composite measure of income, education, and fertility rates. In 2021, global CNS cancer incidence among AYAs was 57,645 cases, with a prevalence of 271,770. The ASIR was 1.92 per 100,000, the ASMR 0.95 per 100,000, and DALYs totaled 1,744,650. High-SDI regions reported higher ASIR but lower ASMR and ASDR. By 2040, case numbers are projected to rise, while age-standardized rates may stabilize or decline.

Child & adolescent health,10.1016/S2352-4642(25)00102-6,"Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a leading cause of lower respiratory tract infection and hospitalisations in infants worldwide. The primary analyses of HARMONIE showed that nirsevimab reduced infant hospitalisations due to RSV-associated lower respiratory tract infection through the RSV season. This analysis aims to evaluate nirsevimab's efficacy at 180 days after dosing, a period exceeding the typical 5-month RSV season. HARMONIE is an ongoing, open-label, parallel arm, randomised, controlled, phase 3b study conducted in France, Germany, and the UK. Infants aged 12 months or younger, born at a gestational age of at least 29 weeks, were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either a single intramuscular dose of nirsevimab (50 mg for children <5 kg or 100 mg for children ≥5 kg) or standard care (without RSV prophylaxis) before or during their first RSV season. Randomisation was electronically done, stratified by country and age-group. The primary efficacy endpoint for this analysis was the incidence of hospitalisations due to RSV-associated lower respiratory tract infection up to 180 days after nirsevimab administration or randomisation in all randomised participants. Safety up to 365 days following nirsevimab administration was also assessed. This trial is ongoing and registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT05437510. Between Aug 8, 2022, and Feb 28, 2023, 8057 infants were randomly assigned to either the nirsevimab group (n=4038) or the standard care group (n=4019). The median age at randomisation was 4·00 months (IQR 1·0-7·0; range 0·0-12·0, and 4195 (52·1%) were male and 3862 (47·9%) were female. Up to 180 days, 12 (0·3%) of 4038 infants in the nirsevimab group and 68 (1·7%) of 4019 infants in the standard care group had been hospitalised for RSV-associated lower respiratory tract infection, corresponding to a nirsevimab efficacy of 82·7% (95% CI 67·8-91·5; p<0·0001).

Psychiatry,10.1016/S2215-0366(25)00105-1,"Non-remission after psychological therapy for major depressive disorder is common, yet there are no established further-line treatments. In the UK National Health Service (NHS) Talking Therapies programme, about 50% of patients with depression who come to the end of the stepped care pathway do not show remission of symptoms. We aimed to investigate whether mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) can improve clinical outcomes and whether the additional financial cost is worthwhile. We conducted a parallel, randomised, controlled, superiority trial in three sites in the UK (Devon, London, and Sussex). Patients with current major depressive disorder whose symptoms had not reached remission (assessed as Patient Health Questionnaire-9 [PHQ-9] score ≥10) after an adequate dose of NHS Talking Therapies high-intensity therapy (≥12 sessions) were recruited from 20 NHS Talking Therapies services. Participants were allocated through remote random assignment (1:1) to MBCT plus treatment as usual or treatment as usual alone at the UK Clinical Research Collaboration-registered Exeter Clinical Trials Unit with minimisation on depression severity (PHQ-9 score <19 vs ≥19), antidepressant use at baseline (yes vs no), and recruitment site (Devon vs London vs Sussex). MBCT was delivered via videoconference and comprised an individual orientation session and eight weekly group sessions. The primary clinical outcome was reduction in depression symptomatology at 34 weeks after randomisation, using the PHQ-9. Cost-effectiveness was evaluated in terms of costs to primary, secondary, and tertiary health and social care services collected using the Adult Service Use Schedule and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) via health utilities derived from the EQ-5D. Primary outcome analyses were masked in the intention-to-treat population using observed data only. Lived experience experts were integral to all stages of this research. The trial was prospectively registered with ISRCTN, ISRCTN17755571. Between April 20, 2021, and Jan 24, 2023, we enrolled 234 eligible participants, 166 (71%) of whom identified as women, 65 (28%) as men, one (<1%) as other, and two (1%) preferred not to say. The mean age was 42·5 years (SD 13·9). 201 (86%) of 234 participants were White. 118 participants were assigned to MBCT plus treatment as usual and 116 to treatment as usual alone, 101 and 102 of whom completed the final follow-up, respectively. At 34 weeks after randomisation, the MBCT plus treatment as usual group had significantly lower levels of depression symptomatology than the treatment as usual alone group (adjusted between-group difference -2·49, 95% CI -3·89 to -1·09; p=0·0006; Cohen's d -0·41, 95% CI -0·67 to -0·15). Utility scores were higher and costs were lower in the MBCT group (adjusted mean cost difference -£245·23, 95% CI -581·92 to 91·46; p=0·15) over the course of the study. The MBCT plus treatment as usual group had an estimated 99% chance of being cost-effective at the £20 000 per QALY threshold. Bootstrapped mean differences in costs and QALYs indicated a 91% probability of MBCT plus treatment as usual being less costly and more effective than treatment as usual alone for all values a decision maker might be willing to pay for an improvement in QALYs. We observed no trial or treatment-related serious adverse events and no other evidence of harms. Our findings show that mindfulness-based treatment can be beneficial after non-remission from major depressive disorder following psychological, stepped care treatments. Together with evidence from previous studies of non-remission after pharmacological treatment, our findings establish MBCT, an easily scalable group-based intervention, as a further-line treatment. Implementation of MBCT for patients who continue to have major depressive disorder in routine care settings (NHS Talking Therapies and beyond) is warranted.

PPI in health research ensures the research benefits those most impacted by the research and is a well-established necessity of high-quality research. PPI for large programmes of work involving multiple studies frequently relies on a single PPI group that oversees the entire programme. We believe that this 'traditional' approach can negatively contribute to the power imbalance between researchers and PPI members, since PPI members have a very wide remit and are unable to embed themselves fully in all aspects of the research. The study aimed to evaluate a novel PPI approach, the 'Patient Bridge Role', designed to promote a more equal distribution of power between public collaborators and researchers in a large research programme. The Patient Bridge Role involves assigning specific public collaborators to each work package, facilitating deeper engagement and communication. The Patient Bridge Role addresses the limitations of traditional PPI. This approach requires clear role definitions and collaborative development of guidelines to ensure effective communication and shared decision-making. Despite initial challenges related to role clarity and boundaries, the Patient Bridge Roles successfully promoted a more balanced partnership between researchers and public collaborators. Active partnerships between public collaborators and researchers are critical to creating more relevant and higher quality research. Yet, there are many practical and conceptual barriers to this. The Patient Bridge Role offers a promising strategy for enhancing PPI in large research programmes.",von Wagner C,Department of Epidemiology and Public Health,r.l.summers@exeter.ac.uk.

Despite these potential benefits, little is known about the cost-effectiveness of self-guided e-health interventions. The aim of the study was to compare the cost and consequences of 'iSupport', an e-health intervention to reduce mental health issues in dementia carers. A cost-consequence analysis (CCA) of a multi-centre, single-blind randomised controlled trial of iSupport. The CCA was conducted from a public sector (National Health Service, social care and local authority) perspective plus a wider societal perspective. Delivery costs of iSupport were collected using a bottom-up micro-costing approach. 352 participants were recruited from three centres in England, Wales and Scotland. Participants eligible for inclusion were adults over the age of 18 years who self-identified as an unpaid carer with at least 6 months of experience caring for an individual with a diagnosis of dementia. Between 12 November 2021 and 31 March 2023, 2332 carers were invited to take part in the study. 352 participants were randomised: 175 randomised to the iSupport intervention group and 177 to the usual care control group. The mean age of participants in the intervention and control groups was 63 and 62, respectively. The CCA presented the disaggregated costs and health-related quality of life measured using the EuroQol five-dimension. There was no significant difference in generic health-related quality of life measured using the EQ-5D-5L (p=0.67). Both groups reported higher mean costs between baseline and 6 months, but the change in costs was significantly lower in the intervention group. Between baseline and 6 months, the mean change in total resource use costs from the public sector perspective was significantly different between groups (p=0.003, r=-0.161) reporting a mean change per participant of £146 (95% CI: -33 to 342) between the intervention and control groups. From the wider societal perspective, there was no significant difference (p=0.23) in the mean change in total resource use and informal care costs between the two groups from baseline to 6 months. Use of iSupport was associated with reduced health and social care resource use costs for carers compared with care-as-usual.

Enrolled nurses (n=7), critical care registered nurses (n=16), and intensive care physicians (n=8) employed at an intensive care unit were divided into nine focus groups organised according to the profession. The overall theme, Balancing behaviour and knowledge in teamwork, emerged from the two categories of creating a safe atmosphere when working in an unknown environment and counteracting and mitigating destructive team dynamics. The theme captures how well-functioning teamwork must take into account members not acting as team players while also building a secure environment when working in new surroundings outside the intensive care unit. The categories describe how mutual respect, effective teamwork and a safe atmosphere were fostered through support without taking over tasks and countering power structures. Navigating teamwork during critical situations is inherently complex, making it essential to understand team interactions and factors influencing individual behaviour.

Mean TDF domain scores were calculated (mean scores ≤3.5 indicated barriers, ≥5 indicated facilitators). Free-text data were thematically analysed using the TDF. United Kingdom. The survey was completed by 198 respondents: physiotherapists (n=66, 33%), occupational therapists (n=49, 25%), nurses (n=44, 22%), pharmacists (n=39, 20%). Only 47 (24%) of survey respondents had certified fit notes; 66 (37%) had completed training, most pharmacists had done neither. TDF analysis indicated three barriers: 1) 'skills' (being able to certify, review and practice completing fit notes) (mean=3.32, SD=0.75, 95% CI 1.84, 4.80); 2) 'goals' (the level of priority given to fit note completion) (mean=3.22, SD=0.51, 95% CI 2.21, 4.22); 3) 'memory, attention and decision processes' (disagreeing with the statement: 'certifying fit notes is something I do automatically') (mean=2.73, SD=0). Free-text comments suggested that low 'skills' rates may be due to lack of opportunity to do training. The low priority afforded to completing fit notes, which was not done automatically as part of their role, may reflect the lack of organisational policies/guidelines or priorities.The only facilitator identified was 'belief about consequences' (mean=5.74, SD=0.12, 95% CI: 5.50, 5.98). Participants believed that certifying fit notes was useful and worthwhile. Legislation allowing NOPPs to undertake fit note certification does not appear to have been successfully implemented. Further resources are required to provide NOPPs with the necessary skills/confidence (e.g., via training) to certify fit notes, supporting more patients to return to and remain in work.",Radford K; Pahl N,NIHR Nottingham Biomedical Research Centre; Society of Occupational Medicine,Jade.Kettlewell@nottingham.ac.uk.

Within the multicentre study Patient Safety in Paediatric Oncology, a trigger tool was created to address the unique needs of paediatric oncology. Although trigger tools are highly valued for detecting adverse events, concerns about their usability and reliability persist. Understanding the perspectives of medical record reviewers using these tools may provide valuable insights for improving their usability and reliability. This study aimed to explore the experiences of medical record reviewers involved in the development and use of a Paediatric Oncology Trigger Tool. A descriptive qualitative case study was conducted to investigate the experiences of medical record reviewers participating in the development and use of the Paediatric Oncology Trigger Tool. Data were collected through a semi-structured focus group interview conducted via Zoom, involving six reviewers with varying levels of experience in paediatric oncology and trigger tool methodology. The interview was audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim. The written text was analysed in its entirety using reflexive thematic analysis. The analysis revealed an overarching theme of  This study offers a comprehensive examination and clarity regarding the development and use of a patient safety instrument, a process marked by both challenges and facilitators from the perspective of medical record reviewers.

This study investigated ICRM implementation from clinic workers' and patients' experiences in the Gauteng province. A mixed-methods cross-sectional survey was conducted across 45 Gauteng PHCs. Anonymous semistructured interviews with 335 clinic staff explored their knowledge and experiences with the ICRM programme. Facility assessments captured structural factors impacting ICRM implementation. Log-binomial regression was used to assess factors related to confidence in ICRM implementation and improvements in ICRM certification, and thematic analysis examined patient and staff experiences. While 86.9% of clinical/management staff (95% CI 75.1 to 93.6) reported understanding ICRM, only 41.9% (95% CI 32.6 to 53.0) could cite specific guidelines. Enablers included guideline training (reported by 47.9% of staff, 95% CI 39.6 to 56.3) and support from district teams (44.6%, 95% CI 36.6 to 52.8). Barriers included facility size (32.9%, 95% CI 25.7 to 40.9) and infrastructure challenges (28.4%, 95% CI 21.6 to 36.2). Staff confidence in ICRM implementation was moderate (63.1%, 95% CI 56.1 to 69.6), higher when ICRM champions were present (relative risk ratio (RRR) 2.3 vs not present, 95% CI 1.0 to 5.2), guidelines were clear to staff (RRR 2.3, 95% CI 1.1 to 5.0) and sufficient training was perceived (RRR 2.7, 95% CI 1.4 to 5.3). From 2018 to 2021, 60.3% of facilities (95% CI 43.8 to 74.8) improved in ICRM classification. Compared with facilities with no status change, staff from clinics with downgraded stats were less likely to report clear guidelines (RRR 0.5, 95% CI 0.2 to 1.0) to identify an ICRM champion (RRR 0.3, 95% CI 0.1 to 0.7) or have a knowledgeable manager (RRR 0.01, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.3). Challenges in ICRM implementation persist.

Currently, innovative IP/Ds may be undertaken with local National Health Service (NHS) organisation approval via new procedure committees (NPCs) or approval from the Health Research Authority (HRA). The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence Interventional Procedures Advisory Committee (NICE IPAC) provides guidance for appropriate approvals. Outcome monitoring is performed to inform decisions about continuing with the new IP/D or abandoning/pausing if safety data show signals of harm; this is the responsibility of local hospitals. Hospital policies for this process have hitherto not been investigated. To explore local hospital NPC processes for monitoring clinical and safety outcomes and decision-making regarding the delivery of new IP/Ds. NHS organisation policies for the introduction of new IP/Ds from England and Wales were systematically examined using a standardised extraction form developed a priori. All policies and associated documents were analysed using the principles of content analysis, and information extracted included (1) the collection of safety and outcome data for approved IP/Ds; (2) requirements to adhere to NICE guidance and (3) how committees decide to abandon/pause the use of new IP/Ds. All policies (n=113) included information about monitoring outcomes of new IP/Ds. Substantial variation between hospitals in monitoring requirements was observed. Just 66 provided details of safety reporting oversight methods. Only 72 policies explicitly recommended following NICE IPAC guidance for the IP. Information about how decisions were made to abandon/pause new IP/Ds was included in 25 policies. There is a disparity among hospitals in how outcome and safety data of new IP/Ds are monitored. This has implications for patient safety. Our findings support the IMMDS report recommendations for the need for better oversight and governance of innovative IP/Ds, including collecting and sharing robust outcome data to inform decision-making.",,,lucy.wallis@bristol.ac.uk.
40379279,Implementing a Rapid Improvement Event with anonymised individual performance reporting on benign hysterectomy care: a retrospective comparative analysis.,2025-05-16,BMJ open quality,10.1136/bmjoq-2024-003172,"Value-Based Healthcare (VBHC) aims to enhance patient outcomes while managing costs. Building on VBHC principles, the Ministry of Health Singapore introduced the Value-Driven Care programme, including initiatives like Enhanced Recovery After Surgery and Patient Blood Management. However, clinical quality remained suboptimal despite these measures due to limited clinician performance transparency. To address this, the Office of Value-Based Healthcare led a Rapid Improvement Event that implemented Individual Clinical Reports (ICRs) to provide clinicians with performance feedback. This study hypothesises that an active feedback loop using ICRs, combined with regular departmental dashboard reviews, would improve clinical quality, measured by the Clinical Quality Index (CQI). A quasi-experimental design compared pre-ICR and post-ICR implementation data, analysing improvements using Fisher's exact tests and logistic regression. Adjustments were made for multiple variables such as comorbidities, surgery type and American Society of Anesthesiologists classification. ICR implementation significantly improved CQI performance (p=0.013) and reduced blood transfusion (p=0.046). Secondary outcomes, including length of stay, complications and readmission rates, also showed improvements with trends towards significance. An active feedback loop consisting of ICRs and multidisciplinary team discussions enhanced CQI for hysterectomy patients at a tertiary hospital in Singapore. They represent a valuable feedback tool with the potential to improve care quality in other standardised surgeries.",,,hairil.rizal.abdullah@singhealth.com.sg.

40378861,Effects of Janus kinase inhibitors in adults admitted to hospital due to COVID-19: a systematic review and individual participant data meta-analysis of randomised clinical trials.,,The Lancet. Respiratory medicine,10.1016/S2213-2600(25)00055-4,"Evidence from randomised clinical trials (RCTs) of Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors-compared with usual care or placebo-in adults treated in hospital for COVID-19 is conflicting. We aimed to evaluate the benefits and harms of JAK inhibitors compared with placebo or usual care and whether treatment effects differed between prespecified participant subgroups. For this systematic review and individual participant data meta-analysis (IPDMA), we searched Medline via Ovid, Embase via Elsevier, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, the Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register, and the COVID-19 L·OVE Platform, including backward and forward citation searching (last search Nov 28, 2024), for RCTs (unpublished or published in any format and any language) that randomly assigned adults (aged ≥16 years) admitted to a hospital due to COVID-19 to receive either a JAK inhibitor (any type) or no JAK inhibitor (ie, received site-specific standard of care with or without placebo), and requested individual participant data (IPD) from the original trial teams. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality at day 28 after random assignment. We used two-stage meta-analyses adjusting for age and respiratory support, and pooled estimates using random-effects models. The assessment of individual-level effect modifiers was based solely on within-trial information and continuous modifiers were investigated as both linear and non-linear interactions. We used the Instrument for Assessing the Credibility of Effect Modification Analyses to appraise the subgroup analyses and the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation approach to adjudicate the certainty of evidence. Grade 3 or 4 adverse events and serious adverse events by day 28, and adverse events of special interest within 28 days, were assessed among secondary outcomes. This study was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42023431817). We identified 16 eligible trials. IPD were obtained from 12 trials, corresponding to 12 902 adults admitted to hospital between May, 2020, and March, 2022. These trials represented 12 902 [96·1%] of 13 423 participants from all eligible trials worldwide. Seven trials evaluated baricitinib, three evaluated tofacitinib, and two evaluated ruxolitinib. Overall, 755 (11·7%) of 6465 participants in the JAK inhibitor group died by day 28 compared with 805 (13·2%) of 6108 participants in the no JAK inhibitor group (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 0·67 [95% CI 0·55-0·82]; high-certainty evidence; 39 fewer per 1000 [95% CI 55 fewer to 21 fewer]). JAK inhibitors decreased the need for new mechanical ventilation or other respiratory support and allowed for faster discharge from hospital by about 1 day. We observed fewer grade 3 and 4 adverse events and serious adverse events in the JAK inhibitor group (14 fewer per 1000 [95% CI 24 fewer to 4 fewer]; moderate-certainty evidence). The rates of adverse events of special interest were similar across both groups. No credible subgroup effect on mortality at day 28 was found for ventilation status, type of JAK inhibitor, presence of comorbidities, timing of treatment initiation after symptom onset, C-reactive protein concentration, or concomitant use of dexamethasone or tocilizumab. We found a moderately credible effect modification by age, with younger participants showing larger relative treatment effects than older participants, but similar absolute treatment effects due to higher baseline risk for older participants. This IPDMA of RCTs in adults admitted to hospital due to COVID-19 found that JAK inhibitors reduced mortality across all levels of respiratory support, independent of dexamethasone or tocilizumab, and probably decreased serious and severe adverse events compared with no JAK inhibitors.

In this study, we leveraged the detailed insights provided by human intracortical recordings to elucidate how somatosensory responses to simple tactile stimuli vary across different stimulus intensities and reporting conditions. Among the various spatiotemporal components of somatosensory processing, we observed tonic responses in posterior perisylvian regions that exhibited all the key characteristics of somatosensory NCCs. These responses remained invariant regardless of reporting, displayed an all-or-nothing pattern at the verge of the sensory threshold, and showed the most pronounced divergence between perceived and non-perceived stimuli. Overall, our findings indicate that conscious perception of simple tactile stimuli depends on higher-order somatosensory regions and that sustained neural dynamics in these areas may serve as an organizational principle of somatosensory awareness.",Sartori I,Department of Neuroscience,davide.albertini@unipr.it.

We sought to obtain insights regarding how ICU clinicians use metaphors regarding patients' disease and treatment trajectory. We identified clinicians' metaphor use in N=101 audio-recorded neonatal, pediatric, and adult ICU family conversations about life-sustaining treatments. Using qualitative content analyses, each metaphor's semantic domain, disease phase, and dialogical function were coded. Overarching themes and patterns were analyzed. Journey metaphors (N = 140 in N = 54 conversations) most frequently referred to the semantic domains boundary, path and bridge. Although most functioned to convey clinical information (72 %), metaphors were mainly presented in an emotionally charged way, serving to manage families' perceptions. As patients' conditions deteriorated, metaphors more often functioned to prepare families for medical limits. Metaphors were sometimes potentially unclear. Others suggested high patient agency, starkly contrasting with patients' unconscious state. Metaphors related to ICU patients' disease and treatment trajectory are common. They may clarify information or strengthen clinicians' arguments but can also cause confusion and thereby hinder decision-making. Enhancing clinicians' awareness about their metaphor use may promote more effective information exchange and decision-making.",,,M.A.Hillen@amsterdamumc.nl.

Clinical,10.1016/j.nicl.2025.103796,"Multimodal lifestyle interventions might help to maintain healthy cognition in older age and to delay onset of dementia. Here, we studied the effects of a multi-modal lifestyle-based intervention, based on the FINGER trial, on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) markers of hippocampal-limbic atrophy and cerebral small vessel disease in older adults at increased risk for dementia in Germany. Leipzig participants of the multicenter AgeWell.de randomized controlled trial underwent neuroimaging before and after a two year intervention at 3 Tesla MRI. We extracted hippocampal volume and entorhinal cortex thickness (ECT), free water fraction (FW), peak width of skeletonized mean diffusivity (PSMD), white matter hyperintensity volume and mean gray matter cerebral blood flow and assessed the effect of the intervention on these imaging markers using linear mixed models. We also tested the effect of the intervention on the hippocampus-dependent Mnemonic Similarity Test and fixel-based white matter microstructure. 56 individuals (mean (sd) age: 68.8 (4.2) years, 26 females, 24/32 intervention/control group) were included at baseline and 41 returned after an average of 28 months for the second assessment. ECT and FW exhibited stronger decline in the intervention compared to the control group in preregistered models but not when adjusted for baseline differences. All other markers progressed similarly across groups, however sample size was smaller than expected. In exploratory analyses, cerebral blood flow increased more in the intervention group and this change was associated with decreases in systolic blood pressure. In this group of older adults at risk for dementia, we find no conclusive evidence whether a multi-modal lifestyle intervention improves brain imaging markers of neurodegeneration and small vessel disease. Preliminary evidence suggested an association of the intervention, increased cerebral blood flow and systolic blood pressure reductions.

However, little evidence is available regarding their impact on response to treatment in the neoadjuvant setting. The aim of the study was to describe the comorbid conditions and concomitant medications in a population of BC patients and to assess whether the use of concomitant medications modifies the pathological complete response (pCR) rates to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) in a causal manner. Patients with invasive stage I-III BC from the French multicenter longitudinal prospective cohort CANcer TOxicities (CANTO) (NCT01993498) were included. Chronic concomitant medication intakes during NAC were binary-categorized at level 2 of the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) classification system. The average causal effect of concomitant medication on pCR was estimated using a doubly robust estimator (targeted maximum likelihood estimation) after adjustment on clinical and pathological factors, including notably chronic comorbid conditions. Out of 1420 patients with BC treated by NAC included in the study, 662 patients (46.6%) had at least one chronic comorbid condition and 355 patients (25.0%) declared at least one chronic concomitant medication. After causal analyses, several drug classes were significantly associated with pCR: drugs used in diabetes and lipid-modifying agents were significantly associated with increased response to NAC [odds ratio (OR) 1.86, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.03-3.27, P < 0.001 and OR 1.58, 95% CI 1.16-2.13, P < 0.001, respectively], while the use of cardiac therapy and diuretics was significantly associated with decreased response to NAC (OR 0.55, 95% CI 0.35-0.84, P < 0.001 and OR 0.43, 95% CI 0.21-0.85, P < 0.001, respectively).

Next, 66 teeth of 3 dogs were allocated into 3 groups (each including 22 teeth) according to post-operative follow-up period: group I: 2 weeks, group II: 4 weeks, and group III: 8 weeks. Each group was further subdivided according to pulpotomy filling material into two subgroups, with subgroup 1 (alginate/BMBGNPs (20 wt. %) loaded hydrogel) and subgroup 2 mineral trioxide aggregate (MTA). Pulp chambers were mechanically exposed through class V cavities. A complete pulpotomy was executed. The tested materials were positioned on the radicular pulp and finally covered with resin composite restorations. One dog was sacrificed after 2, 4, and 8 weeks. Teeth were prepared for histological evaluation assessing inflammatory cell response, pulp tissue organisation, and dentin bridge formation. The Mann-Whitney U test was employed to evaluate the scores of histological parameters between tested materials (P ≤ .05). Alginate/BMBG NPs (20 wt. %) loaded hydrogel showed normal pulp configuration at 2 and 4 weeks, which was enhanced after 8 weeks (P ≤ .05). Moderate inflammatory reaction was noted at 2 weeks, which was improved after 4 and 8 weeks (P ≤ .05). MTA group demonstrated less favourable pulpal response and inflammatory reaction with a statistically significant difference across all observational periods (P ≤ .05). After 8 weeks all teeth in group 1 exhibited the thickest dentin bridge (P ≤ .05).

This distress is associated with postoperative maladaptive behaviors. Virtual reality (VR) is an innovative tool for reducing anxiety and pain during various medical procedures. Previous randomized controlled trials have demonstrated its efficacy in reducing children's anxiety in the preoperative waiting room or during induction. The primary aim of this study was to examine the feasibility of VR distraction throughout the perioperative period, from the waiting room until the induction of general anesthesia (GA). Secondary aims were to assess its clinical utility, tolerability, and initial clinical efficacy. A mixed methods, concurrent triangulation feasibility trial was piloted at the Shriners Hospitals for Children-Canada. Participants played an interactive VR game throughout the perioperative period, starting from the waiting room until induction. Feasibility was examined with the duration of the VR intervention, recording the number of interruptions, and taking field notes. Clinical utility was assessed using a perception questionnaire. Tolerability was evaluated by the Child Simulator Sickness Questionnaire (CSSQ). Initial clinical efficacy was assessed by the Faces Pain Scale-Revised, Faces Anxiety Scale, Graphic Rating Scale for multidimensional pain, the Induction Compliance Checklist, and the Pediatric Anesthesia Emergence Delirium scale. Quantitative data were supported with field notes and semistructured interviews with patients and parents. Quantitative and qualitative themes were compared via the triangulation protocol to produce final themes. A total of 39 patients, with a mean age of 11.9 (SD 2.8) years, undergoing elective surgery under GA participated in the study. Stakeholders, including patients, parents, and health care providers, were receptive and willing to adapt to VR. Of the 39 patients, 19 (49%) continued to use VR during transportation and 6 (15%) were induced with VR. Barriers to feasibility included (1) interruptions to VR in 92% (36/39) of patients by health care professionals, (2) unpredictable surgery delays prolonging the duration of the VR intervention (mean 23.1, SD 24.4 minutes; range 5-150 minutes), and (3) discontinuation of VR before induction due to mask seal (n=3) and discomfort with supine positioning (n=2). Patients were generally satisfied with VR, deemed it acceptable and easy to use, and would recommend it to others. VR was tolerable with no self-reported simulator sickness (CSSQ: mean 0.01, SD 0.1). The mean Faces Anxiety Score was 1.5 (SD 1.1) at baseline and 0.7 (SD 0.9) during VR. While VR demonstrated good clinical utility and was well tolerated in the broad perioperative setting, this study highlighted important feasibility barriers in the waiting room and especially during induction of anesthesia, both at the organizational and technical levels. This study highlights several considerations that should be carefully addressed for the successful implementation of perioperative VR.",,,

However, performing this monitoring can be challenging for financial and logistical reasons in low resource settings. This proof-of-concept study aimed to compare the accuracy of a low cost external tocodynamometer we developed to that of a commercially available external tocodynamometer. In total, 60 patients with anticipated vaginal deliveries at a hospital in Blantyre, Malawi were enrolled. Both the research device and the commercial device were secured to the patients, and traces were recorded simultaneously from each device. Trace pairs were split into 10 minute segments, and contraction locations were independently annotated on a selection of 75 contemporaneous trace pairs from 38 out of 60 patients by two expert clinicians. In total, 484 contractions were marked on the research device, and 465 contractions were marked on the commercially available device, 312 of which were marked consistently on both devices. The average consistency of marked contractions on the same device between the two observers was 0.89 for the research device compared with 0.84 for the commercially available device. The average consistency between the two devices using a 10-patient rolling average increased from 0.50 at the beginning of the study to 0.64 at the end. The annotated traces from the two devices suggested the same clinical management 72% of the time. The research device displayed reasonable agreement with the commercially available tocodynamometer in detecting contractions. The increase in the measured consistency over the course of the study suggests that improving usability of the device to ensure better positioning on the patient could result in improved performance. Further studies assessing the accuracy and usability of the device are needed.",,,

Findings were organized into 9 sub-themes and 3 themes: positive experiences with EIMDs (usability and easy acceptance, enhanced self-management); stresses and challenges of using these devices (negative emotional stress, device trust issues, social difficulties, economic burdens, and technical challenges); and patient expectations from these devices (expectations related to device construction and function and external support). Patients have positive experiences using electronic monitoring devices for inhalation devices but also face various social, psychological, and technical challenges. Health care workers should consider patient experiences with EIMDs to tailor these devices to patient needs, ultimately enhancing device acceptance and adherence. Further research should focus on increasing EIMDs convenience and usability for patients with COPD and asthma.",,,

Ensuring EHR alignment across sites facilitates seamless information exchange. We developed a pipeline for EHR flowsheet alignment between health-care organizations. The pipeline is augmented by mapping flowsheet data fields to concepts in the Clinical Care Classification (CCC) nursing terminology. Flowsheet templates and measures from 2 study sites were transformed into template-measure (T-M) pairs. They were aligned through exact, lexical, or semantic matching. Lexical matches were assessed using Jaccard similarity and fuzzy matching methods. Semantic alignment was determined using cosine similarity between large language model-generated embeddings of T-M pairs and CCC concepts to rank and recommend the top n concepts in CCC. Concept mappings were evaluated based on whether concepts were mapped consistently within the CCC hierarchy. We totally aligned 31 255 unique T-M pairs in acute care units and 27 012 T-M pairs in intensive care units from 2 study sites. When restricted to the top-ranked CCC concept (n = 1), we achieved a 63% flowsheet alignment rate with a 53% concept mapping rate. Expanding to the top 3 concepts (n = 3) improved alignment to 96.5% and concept mapping to 96%. Electronic health record data field alignment with concept mapping offers opportunities to standardize data elements presented in flowsheets across health-care sites. We demonstrated the feasibility of leveraging a semi-automated pipeline to streamline the EHR flowsheet alignment and accelerate the manual concept mapping process.",,,
40378121,What is the lifetime cost of alcohol consumption? an estimation of economic burden in Thailand.,2025-05-16,PloS one,10.1371/journal.pone.0322944,"This study aimed to estimate the lifetime cost of alcohol consumption per individual drinker in Thailand to support policy formulation. Using an incidence-based cost-of-illness (COI) approach, a hybrid model combining a decision tree and a Markov model, incorporating six major alcohol-related diseases and conditions (i.e., hypertension, hemorrhagic stroke, liver cirrhosis, liver cancer, alcohol use disorders, and road injuries), was employed to analyze both direct costs (i.e., direct medical, direct nonmedical, property damage) and indirect costs (i.e., absenteeism, premature mortality). All costs were reported in Thai baht 2022 (35.06 THB = 1US$). From a societal perspective, the lifetime costs for individual male and female drinker were estimated at 721,344 THB (95% CI: 687,910-754,779) and 263,812 THB (95% CI: 249,250-278,374), respectively. Quitting earlier reduced costs significantly, with average quitting ages resulting in the cost of 568,932 THB for males and 115,167 THB for females. On average, each Thai drinker incurs a cost of 498,196 THB. These findings highlight the substantial economic burden of alcohol consumption in Thailand, underscoring the critical need for effective interventions and policies, along with more rigorous enforcement of current regulations aimed at encouraging early cessation and preventing the initiation of drinking, such as through advertising bans, sales restrictions, improving access to counseling and treatment.",Praditsitthikorn N,Department of Disease Control,
40378096,From blueprint to biobank: Leveraging expert recommendations for implementing change (ERIC) to pediatric cancer biobanking in Pakistan.,2025-05-16,PloS one,10.1371/journal.pone.0321316,"In low- and middle-income countries, limited infrastructure and resources hinder biobank establishment, affecting specimen diversity. Addressing this gap is crucial for equitable health outcomes, as current databases are skewed towards Northern-European populations. In Pakistan, pediatric cancer biobanks are non-existent. Indus Hospital & Health Network (IHHN) in Karachi, with its large pediatric cancer unit, aims to establish a biobank to address region-specific pediatric cancer research needs. This manuscript describes the biobank implementation process using implementation science frameworks. The pediatric cancer biobank at IHHN collects FFPE specimens for solid tumors, and isolated mononuclear cells from peripheral blood and bone marrow of suspected acute leukemia. Implementation planning workgroups included clinicians, EMR, IT, management, senior leadership, IRB, and external support from UNC and St. Jude Children's Cancer Hospital. The selection of applicable ERIC (Expert Recommendations for Implementing Change) strategies through stakeholder workgroups considered scope, budget, and feasibility, and context. Standard protocols from ISBER and BCNet guided alignment with best practices. IHHN's past experiences and tacit knowledge gained through rapid, successful implementation also facilitated strategy selection. The EPIS framework (exploration, preparation, implementation, sustainment) was used to map and organize the selected intervention strategies. Biobank implementation at IHHN, organized by EPIS stages, has been described through a set of 41 implementation strategies. Of these, 34 were selected out of 73 originally published ERIC strategies, while 7 were added based on contextually based workgroup consensus. 599 acute leukemia and 1137 solid tumor specimens have been banked since inception of the biobank operations 2 years earlier. The implementation activities and challenges described include infrastructure, swift specimen collection, prior to treatment, and informed consent. The ancillary processes including training and quality control have also been described and related data presented. The implementation of Pakistan's first acute leukemia biobank using ERIC and EPIS frameworks offers a structured approach beneficial for settings with limited biobanking experience. This intervention aligns with recognized implementation science frameworks, while addressing aspects pertinent in low- and middle-income countries.",,,
40377972,Quality and Misinformation About Health Conditions in Online Peer Support Groups: Scoping Review.,2025-05-16,Journal of medical Internet research,10.2196/71140,"The use of health-related online peer support groups to support self-management of health issues has become increasingly popular. The quality of information and advice may have important implications for public health and for the utility of such groups. There is some evidence of variable quality of web-based health information, but the extent to which misinformation is a problem in online peer support groups is unclear. We aimed to gain insight into the quality of information and advice about health conditions in online peer support groups and to review the tools available for assessing the quality of such information. A scoping review was undertaken following the Joanna Briggs Institute scoping review methodology. We searched electronic databases (MEDLINE [Ovid], CINAHL, Web of Science, ASSIA, ProQuest Dissertation and Theses, and Google Scholar) for literature published before November 2023, as well as citations of included articles. Primary research studies, reviews, and gray literature that explored the quality of information and advice in online peer support groups were included. Title and abstracts were independently screened by 2 reviewers. Data were extracted and tabulated, and key findings were summarized narratively. A total of 14 (0.45%) relevant articles, from 3136 articles identified, were included. Of these, 10 (71%) were primary research articles comprising diverse quality appraisal methodologies, and 4 (29%) were review articles. All articles had been published between 2014 and 2023. Across the literature, there was more evidence of poor quality information and misinformation than of good quality information and advice, particularly around long-term and life-threatening conditions. There were varying degrees of misinformation about non-life-threatening conditions and about mental health conditions. Misinformation about noncommunicable diseases was reported as particularly prevalent on Facebook. Fellow online peer support group users often played an active role in correcting misinformation by replying to false claims or providing correct information in subsequent posts. Quality appraisal tools were reported as being used by researchers and health care professionals in appraising the quality of information and advice, including established tools for the appraisal of health-related information (eg, DISCERN, HONcode criteria, and Journal of the American Medical Association benchmark criteria). No tools reported were specifically designed to appraise online peer support group content. While there is good quality information and advice exchanged between users in online peer support groups, our findings show that misinformation is a problem, which is a matter of public health concern. Confidence in the quality of information shared may determine the utility of online peer support groups for patients and health care professionals. Our review suggests that clinical and academic experts in health conditions could play a valuable role in ensuring the quality of content. Several quality appraisal tools are available to support such an initiative.",,,

Most neonatal deaths are considered preventable through high-quality clinical care, which includes adherence to clinical care guidelines. To assess adherence to World Health Organization clinical care guidelines for management of perinatal asphyxia and neonatal sepsis and to identify patient-level factors in adherence among neonates who died from these conditions. This cross-sectional study obtained data from December 2015 through October 2023 from the Child Health and Mortality Prevention Surveillance (CHAMPS) catchment areas in 7 low- and middle-income countries in sub-Saharan Africa (Ethiopia, Kenya, Mali, Mozambique, Sierra Leone, and South Africa) and South Asia (Bangladesh). Participants were neonates who were born alive and were aged 0 to 28 days at the time of death and had either perinatal asphyxia or neonatal sepsis. Medical records of neonates who died from perinatal asphyxia or neonatal sepsis determined by postmortem diagnostics. The main outcome was the proportion of deceased neonates who received guideline-adherent treatments before they died. Mixed-effect multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to identify factors associated with administration of at least bag-valve-mask (BVM) ventilation for perinatal asphyxia. Of the 1194 neonates (median [IQR] age at the time of death, 2 [1-6] days; 692 males [58.0%]) who died and were enrolled in CHAMPS with available clinical data, 476 (39.9%) died from perinatal asphyxia, 562 (47.0%) died from neonatal sepsis, and 156 (13.1%) from both conditions. These neonates had a median (IQR) birth weight of 2130 (1266-2988) g. For cases with perinatal asphyxia, guideline adherence ranged from 12.2% (n = 77) for adrenaline administration to 85.4% (540) for supplemental oxygen administration. Only 4.4% of neonates (28) with perinatal asphyxia received all recommended treatments. Among cases with neonatal sepsis, antibiotics were administered to 86.8% (623), although the recommended treatment was administered to only 61.0% (438). In multivariable analyses, neonates in whom clinicians accurately identified perinatal asphyxia were more likely to receive BVM ventilation than those who had received discordant antemortem and postmortem diagnoses (adjusted odds ratio, 2.00; 95% CI, 1.29-3.12). In this cross-sectional study, clinical care guideline adherence was suboptimal among neonates who died from perinatal asphyxia or neonatal sepsis.

40377830,Recurrent and Novel Pathogenic Variants in Genes Involved with Hearing Loss in the Pakistani Population.,,Molecular diagnosis & therapy,10.1007/s40291-025-00782-w,"Molecular diagnostic rates for hereditary hearing loss vary by genetic ancestry, highlighting the importance of population-specific studies. In Pakistan, where consanguineous marriages are prevalent, genetic research has identified many autosomal recessive genes, advancing understanding of rare and novel hearing loss mechanisms. This study aimed to identify pathogenic genetic variants in 31 families from Azad Kashmir, Pakistan, presenting non-syndromic hearing loss. We conducted exome sequencing and bioinformatics analysis, and targeted gene sequencing on 31 Pakistani families with hearing loss. We identified ten pathogenic, three likely pathogenic variants, and one variant of uncertain significance, comprising six nonsense, four missense, three frameshift, and one deep intronic variant, across ten hearing loss-associated genes (MYO15A, GJB2, SLC26A4, TMC1, HGF, TMIE, SLC19A2, KCNE1, ILDR, PCDH15 and MYO6) in 25 families. The overall diagnostic rate, including families with pathogenic and likely pathogenic variants, was 77.4%. GJB2 was the most frequently affected gene, identified in seven families. Thirteen out of 14 identified variants were homozygous. Notably, we identified two novel variants: MYO15A (NM_016239.4, DFNB3) c.870C>G, p.(Tyr290*) and MYO6 (NM_016239.4, DFNB37) c.3465del, p.(Pro1156Leufs*9). Additionally, we identified c.10475dupA, p.(Leu3493Alafs*25) in MYO15A (NM_016239.4, DFNB3) and c.617T>A, p.(Leu206*) in SLC26A4 (NM_000441.2, DFNB4), previously documented in ClinVar but unpublished. We also propose SLC19A2 as a candidate gene presenting as non-syndromic hearing loss, despite its association with thiamine-responsive megaloblastic anemia syndrome. Our work expands the genotypic and phenotypic spectrum of hearing loss by emphasizing the importance of investigating under-represented groups to identify unique genetic variants and clinical characteristics. Such efforts deepen understanding of genetic diversity in under-represented populations to improve diagnosis and treatment strategies.",,,madiha.shadab@hotmail.com.

As a result, robotic-assisted surgery has become the standard of care for complex procedures, such as radical prostatectomy, with demonstrated benefits in reducing complications and improving clinical outcomes. Despite the rapid evolution of this field, no comprehensive bibliometric analysis has systematically evaluated its scientific trajectory, research trends, and international collaboration. A cross-sectional bibliometric study was conducted using Scopus as the primary data source. A semi-structured search strategy incorporating MeSH terms and synonyms was applied to identify publications related to robotic surgery in urogenital diseases. Data were exported, standardized, and analyzed using Bibliometrix (R 4.3.1) for bibliometric and network analyses. A total of 3506 publications (1993-2024) were included, with 79.2% original articles and 11.6% reviews. The United States (n = 1388) led the scientific production, followed by Italy (n = 389) and Japan (n = 285).

Although it is well appreciated that the niche plays a critical role in gastric epithelium cell differentiation, the relevant molecular factors and the underlying regulatory mechanisms remain poorly understood. In this study, by combining the knowledge of the niche cells obtained from single-cell RNA sequencing and manipulation of signaling pathways, we achieved effective differentiation of various gastric epithelial cell types in mouse and human gastric organoids. These in vitro differentiated cells showed a similar gene expression profile to those in gastric tissues. Specifically, BMP4 signaling stimulates pit cell and parietal cell differentiation. Furthermore, BMP4 and EGF signaling cooperate to enhance pit cell differentiation, whereas inhibition of TGF-β and BMP4 signaling promotes chief cell differentiation. We demonstrated that Zbtb7b is a novel regulator controlling pit cell differentiation. In addition, BMP4, together with the small molecule Isoxazole 9, promotes parietal and enteroendocrine cell differentiation. Our data also revealed the different requirements of parietal and chief cell differentiation between mouse and human. Together, our findings provide a mechanistic insight into gastric epithelial cell differentiation and uncover its similarities and differences between mouse and human, laying a foundation for future investigation and potential clinical use of gastric organoids.",,,ygchen@tsinghua.edu.cn.

This study reports and analyzes the impact of the peer review rounds of a modern radiotherapy department during the first 4 years. Prospectively documented data for 183 peer review sessions consisting of 3725 patients from June 2017 to May 2021 were obtained. The proportion of cases that required major (unacceptable and requires an immediate correction before delivery) and minor plan changes (not ideal, but still allowable for delivery) were analyzed on a site-specific basis. Pareto charts were plotted for each site to demonstrate the reasons for plan changes. Among the cases reviewed, 197 plans (5.29%) required any plan modifications; among these, 111 (2.98%) were major changes, while 86 (2.31%) cases required minor changes. The major changes suggested had decreased from 5.84% to 1.58% over time. The reasons for plan changes were site dependent. Frequent reasons for major plan change were modification in clinical target volume (63.06%), followed by a change in dose or fractionation (24.32%). Minor plan changes were mainly due to changes in normal tissue contour or dose (32.56%), followed by field port or MLCs (23.26%). Adherence to peer review practices since the establishment of the department has led to a considerable reduction in plan modifications with time as a result of consistent improvement in the radiotherapy processes.",Rajendran GR,Department of Physics,

However, it may occasionally fail to meet these specifications due to the nature of patient-derived cells with variable properties as starting material and the complex manufacturing process. The final product that does not meet at least one of the commercial release specifications is referred to as ""out-of-specification"" (OOS). However, the benefit-risk profile of OOS tisagenlecleucel has not yet been fully elucidated. To evaluate the safety and efficacy of OOS tisagenlecleucel in Japanese patients with relapsed or refractory (r/r) diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL). This is a single-arm, open-label, multicenter phase 3b study (NCT04094311). Patients consistent with label indication were enrolled and followed-up for 3 months. Of the 29 patients enrolled between December 2019 and May 2022 across 13 qualified sites in Japan, 28 received tisagenlecleucel, and of these, 23 had r/r DLBCL and 5 had r/r B-ALL. The primary reasons for OOS were low cell viability (15 of 24 batches) and low dose (8 of 23 batches) tisagenlecleucel in the r/r DLBCL group, and high dose (4 of 5 batches) in the r/r B-ALL group. In patients with r/r DLBCL, the grade 3 or 4 cytokine release syndrome and immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome occurred in 3 and 1 patients, respectively. Response assessments were performed for 15 of 23 patients with r/r DLBCL: 6 achieved a complete response, and 1 achieved a partial response as the best response within 3 months.

Scoping literature review. A search of the electronic databases MEDLINE, PubMed, CINAHL, Web of Science, and Scopus that spanned the years 1990 to April 2024 was conducted. The initial search resulted in 13 094 records. Removal of duplicates, title and abstract searches, and final selection of elements that were read in full yielded 30 records, along with 2 records identified from reference lists of critical articles. Twelve validated instruments measuring PROMs assessing HRQoL were identified; 6 were generic and 6 were specific to chronic wounds. The most frequently used generic instruments were the Short Form 36 Health Survey Questionnaire and the EuroQol-five Dimensions-Five levels; they were used in 6 (18.8%) and 3 (9.4%) studies, respectively. The Cardiff Wound Impact Schedule and the Wound-Qol were the most frequently wound-specific instruments; both were applied in 5 (15.6%) studies each. Both condition-specific and generic instruments measure 1 or more conceptual domains that cover the multidimensionality of HRQoL. Generic instruments allow comparison of persons with chronic wounds to populations with other chronic conditions and the general population; however, generic instruments may underestimate changes in QoL in populations with chronic wounds. Condition-specific instruments provide additional information about HRQoL and they are more likely to be responsive to the effects of specific interventions. Research related to instruments that measure PROMs for HRQoL for patients with chronic wounds is limited. Additional research such as longitudinal and randomized studies are needed to strengthen the evidence regarding the applicability and dissemination of PROMS to assess HRQoL in this population.",,,

ART, though effective, may lead to neurotoxic adverse drug reactions, impacting patient adherence and clinical outcomes. Innovative approaches are warranted to balance ART efficacy with minimized neurological risk. This paper investigates how artificial intelligence (AI) may improve telemedicine for individualized ART management to reduce neurotoxicity and raise patient adherence to medication regimes. A comprehensive literature review was conducted using PubMed/MEDLINE, and Google Scholar, among other electronic search databases, with keywords comprising ""Artificial Intelligence,"" ""Telemedicine,"" ""HIV,"" and ""Neurological Comorbidities."" Studies were selected based on relevance to AI applications in personalized HIV care. Inclusion criteria included peer-reviewed articles, systematic reviews, and clinical trials on AI in HIV care. Exclusion criteria omitted non-peer-reviewed articles and studies lacking direct AI relevance. Titles and abstracts were screened before full-text review. There is potential for individualized ART management with AI-integrated telemedicine. By anticipating clinical concerns pertaining to ART-associated neurotoxicity, machine learning systems allow for preemptive therapeutic modifications. Wearable technology and AI-powered mHealth apps enable real-time adherence and symptom monitoring, facilitating the prompt adjustments to therapy if necessitated whilst lowering neurotoxic adverse drug reactions.

40377260,"A randomized, placebo-controlled phase III trial of an autologous, formalin-fixed tumor vaccine for newly diagnosed glioblastoma: trial protocol.",,Japanese journal of clinical oncology,10.1093/jjco/hyaf078,"This multi-institutional, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled phase III trial was designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Cellm-001, an autologous formalin-fixed brain tumor immunostimulant, for newly diagnosed glioblastoma with gross total resection to prolong overall survival (OS) and prevent recurrence after surgery. One hundred twelve patients are to be randomized 1:1 to either Cellm-001 with standard chemoradiotherapy (CRT) or saline solution with standard CRT. Randomization is based on the following stratified randomization criteria: age, Karnofsky Performance Status, and the presence or absence of photodynamic therapy (PDT). The primary endpoint is OS and secondary outcomes are progression-free survival (PFS), OS and PFS with and without radiographically residual lesions as subgroups, OS and PFS with and without PDT, p53-negative OS and PFS, high Cluster of Differentiation-8 score OS and PFS, OS associated with death in primary disease, and 24-month OS and PFS rates. All institutions received ethical committee approval and patient enrollment began in 2021. Given the growing interest in immunotherapy (IMT), we developed an autologous formalin-fixed tumor vaccine (AFTV) manufactured from the patient's own glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) tissue in paraffin-embedded blocks made from the resected tumor and a double-blind, randomized phase IIB trial of AFTV with temozolomide in newly diagnosed GBM was conducted. The 3-year progression-free survival (PFS) rate for patients with gross total resection (GTR) on imaging tended toward improvement: 81% in the AFTV group versus 46% in the placebo group (P = .067). Based on these IIB results, the feasibility of conducting a phase III trial was confirmed for IIB-eligible patients with total resection. We here plan to conduct the world's first double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled phase III trial using Cellm-001 to demonstrate autologous tumor immunostimulant efficacy. This IMT, in combination with sub-analyses (GTR, P53 status, CD8 score, and other factors) to be validated, is expected to be a breakthrough in effective standards of care for the treatment of GBM.

Although international guidelines exist, regional adaptations are necessary to address specific healthcare settings. In 2024, the Qazaq College of Rheumatology (QCR) developed comprehensive national recommendations for the diagnosis and management of SjS in Kazakhstan. A panel of national experts reviewed and synthesized international guidelines (EULAR, ACR, and BSR) alongside local clinical data to create tailored diagnostic and therapeutic algorithms. Special emphasis was placed on the management of severe systemic manifestations and accessibility of therapies within Kazakhstan's healthcare system. The QCR recommendations propose a structured diagnostic approach combining clinical features, serological markers, and minor salivary gland biopsy. Treatment strategies emphasize non-pharmacological measures, symptomatic therapies, and immunomodulatory agents for systemic disease. Rituximab is prioritized as the first-line biologic for refractory severe extraglandular manifestations. A national registry for SjS is proposed to monitor implementation and outcomes. These guidelines aim to standardize the diagnosis and management of Sjögren's syndrome across Kazakhstan, improve patient outcomes, and support further research initiatives.",Aubakirova B,Chief Rheumatologist of Astana; Rheumatologist,

There was never any doubt that the topic of my lecture would be premature ovarian insufficiency (POI). POI is a condition which has been neglected for far too long given its greater global prevalence than originally estimated and its implications to the sufferers, both in terms of quality of life and long-term well-being. The hope is that we are now entering a new era of awareness given the recent update of the European Society of Human Reproduction (ESHRE) POI guideline, achieved through a partnership of the ESHRE, American Society for Reproductive Medicine (ASRM), Centre for Research Excellence in Women's Health in Reproductive Life (CRE WHiRL) at Monash University and IMS with support from numerous global stakeholder organizations. Whilst as a minimum the update of the guideline is expected to improve clinical management of this condition, the process has also identified key areas of much-needed research, where currently only practical guidance can be given due to the lack of data. The aim of my Pieter Van Keep lecture, and therefore this article, was not to replicate the extensive work already conducted to systematically review the literature for the guideline. The aim was to provide a state-of-the-art commentary highlighting the key controversial topics regarding this distressing condition, and how these are being addressed, or should be addressed in the future, for the sake of sufferers and their families.",,,

The growth and culture of cardioids is either conducted in suspension culture or heavily relies on Matrigel encapsulation. Despite the significant advancements in cardioid technology, reproducibility remains a major challenge, limiting their widespread use in both basic research and translational applications. Here, for the first time, we employed synthetic, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-degradable polyethylene glycol (PEG)-based hydrogels to define the effect of mechanical and biochemical cues on cardioid development. Successful cardiac differentiation is demonstrated in all the hydrogel conditions, while cardioid cultured in optimized PEG hydrogel (3 wt.% PEG-2mM RGD) underwent similar morphological development and comparable tissue functions to those cultured in Matrigel. Matrix stiffness and cell adhesion motif play a critical role in cardioid development, nascent chamber formation, contractile physiology, and endothelial cell gene enrichment. More importantly, synthetic hydrogel improved the reproducibility in cardioid properties compared to traditional suspension culture and Matrigel encapsulation. Therefore, PEG-based hydrogel has the potential to be used as an alternative to Matrigel for human cardioid culture in a variety of clinical applications including cell therapy and tissue engineering.",,,
40376847,Structural covariance analysis for neurodegenerative and neuroinflammatory brain disorders.,,Brain : a journal of neurology,10.1093/brain/awaf151,"Structural MRI can robustly assess brain tissue alterations related to neurological diseases and ageing. Traditional morphological MRI metrics, such as cortical volume and thickness, only partially relate to functional impairment and disease trajectories at the individual level. Emerging research has increasingly focused on reconstructing interregional meso- and macro-structural relationships in the brain by analysing covarying morphometric patterns. These patterns suggest that structural variations in specific brain regions tend to covary with deviations in other regions across individuals, a phenomenon termed structural covariance. This concept reflects the idea that physiological and pathological processes follow an anatomically defined spreading pattern. Advanced computational strategies, particularly those within the graph-theoretical framework, yield quantifiable properties at both the whole-brain and regional levels, which correlate more closely with the clinical state or cognitive performance than classical atrophy patterns. This review highlights cutting-edge methods for evaluating morphometric covariance networks on an individual basis, with a focus on their utility in characterizing ageing, central nervous system inflammation and neurodegeneration. Specifically, these methods hold significant potential for quantifying structural alterations in patients with Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, frontotemporal dementia, and multiple sclerosis. By capturing the distinctive morphometric organization of each individual's brain, structural covariance network analyses allow for the tracking and prediction of pathology progression and clinically outcomes, information that can be integrated into clinical decision-making and used as variables in clinical trials. Furthermore, by investigating distinct and cross-diagnostic patterns of structural covariance, these approaches offer insights into shared mechanistic processes that are critical to the understanding of severe neurological disorders and their therapeutic implications. Such advancements pave the way for more precise diagnostic tools and targeted therapeutic strategies.",,,
40376822,Transition to Plain Language Overhead Emergency Announcements: An Experiential Account.,,Military medicine,10.1093/milmed/usaf171,"Established practice in many hospitals, health care settings, and other public environments is to alert people through use of overhead announcements when emergency response is required. These announcements historically used a corresponding color to inform which personnel were to respond. As the number and type of incidents have increased, so have the numbers of colors used to designate events. This has resulted in inconsistent use of colors across organizations and communities to designate the same type of event. For example, Code Green may signify combative person at one location but may signify mass casualty or bomb threat at another. This disparity may lead to preventable risk to patients, staff, and facilities because of misunderstanding. Plain language is communication an audience can understand the first time they read or hear it. This article aims to outline the journey of a federal agency to improve safe care delivery through transitioning from overhead emergency alerts using color codes to plain language. Subject matter experts across disciplines were solicited to define the scope and scale of issues and determine courses of action (COAs). The Delphi method was employed with votes in the group tallied after each round of questions. This same pattern was repeated over several weeks as the team continued debate. The optimal course of action was deduced through their clinical and leadership expertise and research. Implementation plans were developed and supported by a logic model to guide implementation. Ten pilot sites were identified in the National Capitol Region with 3 returning feedback. Products and actions to support implementation were designed and additional team members in specialized areas were solicited to support development. The dissemination plan included a ""begin implementation"" date as opposed to a fixed date to avoid conflicts at facilities that could inhibit adoption at a pre-defined date. Four COAs ranging from standardizing color codes, several variations of a mix of color and plain language, and plain language were determined. Pilot testing was conducted at 10 facilities. Feedback from the initial products was received from 3 facilities. This information was evaluated and used to inform modifications to the products before greater distribution. Deliverables included script cards for announcements, posters, badge buddies, a 6-minute computer-based training course, frequently asked questions, talking points, and an implementation guide. Significant findings were the wide variance of color codes used to signify various events across facilities and challenges faced when considering change to long-established practice. This work demonstrates the strength of collaboration with experts across disciplines to generate workable solutions to meet requirements and improve safety. The gap in this work was length of time to overcome mindsets that color codes were the only solution and time intervals required to obtain approvals. Overall impact of the work is enterprise adoption of standard plain language emergency alerts so personnel, regardless of the facility or location, will recognize and respond to respective threats. Areas for future study include retrospective project evaluation and feedback from external partners about effects and impacts.",Gray PJ; McKiernan SP; Aiken MT; Creedon CKJ; DelVecchio CSP,DiLorenzo Pentagon Health Clinic; Medical Affairs; J3/Operations,
40376378,An Exploration of the Views of Teachers in a Dental College on the Current Performance Appraisal Framework and Promotion Policy.,,Cureus,10.7759/cureus.82270,"Purpose The current description of performance appraisal and advancement in the academic setting in India is nebulous, leading to confusion and a lack of preparation for promotions. The current system of promotions was introduced a few decades ago to meet the demand of a rapidly growing dental education sector. There was a shortage of teachers and having a time-based eligibility for promotion ensured that these vacancies were rapidly filled. This study was conducted to investigate the perceptions of teachers in dental colleges in India regarding the performance appraisal framework. Methods The sample comprised teachers who are currently or were previously employed as faculty in a dental college. We used a purposive sampling and snowballing method for recruiting participants. Teachers working in both public and private dental colleges throughout India were invited to participate in this survey. The self-designed questionnaire was validated and disseminated using Google Forms and WhatsApp. The results were analyzed using descriptive statistics and answers to open-ended questions were noted. Results There were 97 respondents to the questionnaire. All of them were engaged in multiple duties such as academic, administrative and clinical. All the respondents had a good number of publications. Around 45 (46.3%) teachers in the study sample got their first promotion on time. Sixteen (16.4%) of the respondents had applied for promotion through the Career Advancement Scheme (CAS), out of whom only 5% had been promoted. A majority of them (n=51; 52.5%) had up to five research papers where they were the first author whereas 23 (23.7%) of them had up to 10 papers as the first author during their academic careers. Eighty-six (88.6%) of the respondents shared that they fulfilled the eligibility criteria for a promotion. Twenty-seven (27.8%) teachers felt the current academic advancement framework was adequate for promotion. Fifty-five (56.7%) respondents felt the current promotion guidelines were not aligned with the goals and mission of dental education and academia, whereas 33 (34%) of them said the current promotion criteria were not congruent to the roles they were fulfilling in academia. Conclusions We feel that the current atmosphere in dental academia is one of general discontent towards performance appraisal and promotion policy as evidenced from the survey responses. Promotions are awarded to individual faculty members based on their accomplishments in research, teaching, and administrative responsibilities. Successful candidates must demonstrate that their accomplishments merit promotion. If we want to develop institutions as centers of excellence, we need to take a step back and reflect on where we are heading with the current framework for academic advancements, and then create a new one to achieve excellence.",,,
40376375,Breast Cancer Brain Metastases: A Neurosurgical Point of View From a Single-Center Experience.,,Cureus,10.7759/cureus.82306,"Brain metastases represent an important factor in breast cancer morbidity and mortality. Although various therapeutic options improved these patients' outcomes, the incidence of this disease is still rising. Several molecular subtypes of breast cancer have been studied, and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) positive and triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) are more frequently associated with brain metastases. Therefore, anti-HER2 agents have been developed and studied, and they have shown promising results. Nevertheless, in patients with breast cancer brain metastases and acute neurological aggravation, neurosurgery is the primary option and the only one that can immediately reverse the symptoms. In the long run, a multimodal approach involving neurosurgical intervention can positively impact the prognosis. Patients with a confirmed diagnosis of brain metastases from breast cancer (BMBC) between January 2013 and December 2023 were retrospectively reviewed. All patients were newly diagnosed and treated in the 3rd Neurosurgical Department at the Clinical Emergency Hospital, ""Bagdasar-Arseni"" in Bucharest, Romania. Statistical analyses were carried out and interpreted accordingly. The study analyzed 62 patients with BMBC. The median age at diagnosis was 57.19 years, and the most frequently encountered symptoms were represented by headaches, raised intracranial pressure syndrome, and motor deficits. More than 80% of the patients had a Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) between 80 and 100, and the most associated comorbidities were cardiovascular and type 2 diabetes mellitus. A total of 88.70% of the patients had a single brain metastasis, and the most common localizations were the posterior fossa/cerebellum and frontal lobe. Gross-total resection was possible in 79.03% of the cases, while complications were recorded in 8.06%. Better survival rates were registered in patients of younger ages, with higher KPS, single BM, and smaller tumoral volumes, treated by gross-total resection and by a multimodal approach. Notwithstanding significant advancements in the field of breast cancer, the prognosis of patients with brain metastases remains poor. However, a multimodal approach can prolong survival rates and improve outcomes, while in patients with acute clinical manifestations, neurosurgery remains the only immediate option to reverse the symptoms.",,,
40376372,Safety of Laparoscopic Hernia Surgery in Patients With Preoperative Antiplatelet Continuation Therapy.,,Cureus,10.7759/cureus.82287,"Introduction The optimal perioperative antithrombotic management of patients receiving antithrombotic therapy (ATT) remains controversial. In this study, we investigated the safety and feasibility of laparoscopic hernia surgery in patients taking ATT, especially those with a preoperative continuation of single antiplatelet therapy (APT). Methods Three hundred ninety-six (396) patients who underwent laparoscopic hernia surgery between April 2014 and March 2023 in our institution were retrospectively reviewed. The patients were divided into two groups: patients who continued single aspirin monotherapy preoperatively (continued single aspirin therapy (cAPT) group; n = 118) and patients who did not receive APT preoperatively (non-APT group; n = 278). Our perioperative antithrombotic management included preoperative continuation of single aspirin therapy for patients with APT or interruption of oral anticoagulation therapy (ACT), bridging anticoagulation with unfractionated heparin or direct-acting oral anticoagulants (DOAC) replacement for patients with ACT. The primary outcome was postoperative bleeding complications (BC). Results There were four postoperative BCs (Clavien-Dindo classification ≧ Ⅱ) (1.0%) in the whole cohort, one (0.9%) in the cAPT group, and three (1.1%) in the non-APT group, which were not significantly differentiated (p = 0.8330). Multivariable analysis showed heparin or DOAC replacement was an independently and significantly risk factor for postoperative bleeding (p = 0.0029, odds ratio (OR) = 32.6). Continuation of preoperative aspirin was not a risk factor for postoperative BCs. No thromboembolic complications occurred in the whole cohort. Conclusion We can safely and feasibly perform laparoscopic hernia surgery under preoperative antithrombotic management, including the preoperative continuation of single aspirin therapy, without any increase in bleeding events. However, careful consideration is required for the patient who received heparin bridging or DOAC replacement.",,,
40376363,Henoch-Schönlein Purpura Without Proven Immunoglobin A Deposition: A Diagnostic Distinction.,,Cureus,10.7759/cureus.82312,"Henoch-Schönlein purpura (HSP), or immunoglobulin A (IgA) vasculitis (IgAV), is a small vessel vasculitis that is most commonly seen in children; it is classically characterized by IgA deposition within the renal mesangium, resulting in a wide range of symptoms: palpable purpura, arthralgia, gastrointestinal symptoms, renal involvement, and, in severe cases, pulmonary complications or intussusception. Diagnosis relies upon clinical symptoms, histopathology, and direct immunofluorescence (DIF) testing to differentiate HSP from other vasculitides. DIF typically reveals IgA deposits; however, negative DIF findings do not rule out the diagnosis, which indicates the need for an adaptable diagnostic approach. Groups such as the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) and the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) categorize positive IgA as supportive data for an HSP diagnosis but not as a necessity. We present the case of a 14-year-old male with progressive ascending palpable purpura, significant abdominal pain, and lower extremity edema. Histopathological analysis of the skin biopsy confirmed leukocytoclastic vasculitis (LCV); however, his DIF was negative for IgG, IgA, IgM, C3, and fibrinogen deposits. At the time of biopsy, his workup was significant for an isolated elevated alanine aminotransferase (ALT), but urinalysis and renal function testing were unremarkable. Despite a negative DIF, the patient's findings were clinically consistent with HSP, and hence, a diagnosis was made. He was started on a prednisone taper and supportive care for management. After initial improvement, he experienced a flare warranting an additional course of steroids, which improved his symptoms. This report underscores the diagnostic challenges associated with HSP, particularly with negative DIF. While DIF serves as a useful tool in the classification of certain vasculitides, its sensitivity is influenced by the biopsy site, lesion age, and degradation of immune complexes. Providers should maintain a high index of suspicion and carefully consider histopathologic findings and laboratory data when diagnosing HSP. Further research is needed to refine the diagnostic applicability of DIF and its association with disease severity and systemic involvement.",Froberg PW,Research,
40376354,Atrial Fibrillation in Geriatric Patients: A Cross-Sectional Analysis of Risk Factors and Disease Patterns.,,Cureus,10.7759/cureus.82285,"Background Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common type of heart rhythm disorder worldwide, and it disproportionately affects elderly populations, contributing to elevated risks of stroke, heart failure, and cardiovascular mortality. Despite its clinical significance, there remains an underrepresentation of age-specific prevalence trends and modifiable risk factors among elderly cohorts in tertiary care settings. This observational study aimed to quantify AF prevalence, identify age-stratified patterns, and evaluate associations with comorbidities in elderly patients. Methods A cross-sectional study was carried out in a tertiary care hospital, involving 500 patients aged 60 years and older, who were enrolled consecutively upon admission. AF diagnosis was confirmed via a 60-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) or documented medical history. Demographic variables (age and gender) and comorbidities - hypertension, diabetes mellitus (DM), coronary artery disease (CAD), chronic kidney disease (CKD), obesity (body mass index, or BMI ≥30 kg/m²), and prior stroke - were systematically recorded. Risk factor prevalence was compared between AF and non-AF groups using descriptive statistics, without adjustment for potential confounders. Results The cohort had a mean age of 72.5 years (range: 60-89), with a male predominance (n = 300, or 60%). AF was identified in 60 participants, yielding a prevalence of 12%. Age stratification revealed a peak in AF prevalence among those aged 70-79 years: 15 (25%) cases were observed in the 60-69 age group, 30 (50%) in the 70-79 group, and 15 (25%) in the 80-89 group. A Chi-square test for trend confirmed that this variation across age strata was statistically significant (p = 0.03), supporting a true mid-elderly peak in AF occurrence. Hypertension was the most prevalent comorbidity in the overall cohort (n = 360, or 72%), and it was present in 45 (75%) of AF patients. DM was seen in 35 of the 60 AF patients (58.3%), compared to 200 out of 500 overall (40%). Obesity was also disproportionately higher among AF patients (n = 30, or 50%) than in the total cohort (n = 140, or 28%). Similarly, CAD was more frequent in AF patients (n = 25, or 41.7%) compared to the overall population (n = 125, or 25%). CKD was present in 20 (33.3%) AF patients versus 90 (18%) in the full cohort, and a prior history of stroke was noted in 15 (25%) AF patients, compared to 75 (15%) in the overall group. Although the gender distribution in AF cases (n = 36 males, or 60%) mirrored the overall cohort, a Chi-square test showed no statistically significant difference in AF prevalence between males and females (p = 0.99), indicating that gender was not a significant determinant in this study. Conclusion This study reports a 12% prevalence of AF among elderly inpatients, with a statistically significant peak in the 70-79 age group. Key modifiable risk factors - hypertension, diabetes, obesity, and CAD - were more common in patients with AF, highlighting the interplay of metabolic and cardiovascular contributors in its pathogenesis. While routine ECG screening in high-risk subgroups appears feasible in tertiary care settings, the cross-sectional design and potential selection bias limit broader applicability. These findings underscore the need for longitudinal, community-based studies to confirm age-specific trends and develop scalable AF screening strategies for elderly populations.",,,

With its ability to produce realistic and confidential patient data, generative artificial intelligence (AI) offers a promising avenue that could revolutionize patient-centric healthcare. This systematic review aims to assess the role of generative AI in personalized medicine. Following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, we searched PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, CINAHL, and Google Scholar, identifying 549 studies. After removing duplicates and applying eligibility criteria, 27 studies were found relevant and were included in this systematic review. Generative adversarial networks (GANs) were the most commonly used models (16 studies), followed by variational autoencoders (VAEs; seven studies). These models were primarily applied to drug response prediction, treatment effect estimation, biomarker discovery, and patient stratification. Generative AI models have shown significant promise in revolutionizing personalized medicine by enabling precise treatment predictions and patient-specific therapeutic insights.

Here, we present a case of a 26-year-old woman with persistent left wrist pain refractory to conservative treatment. Physical examination revealed tenderness over the lunate with diminished sensation in the ulnar and median nerve distribution. However, nerve conduction studies showed normal nerve function, ruling out carpal tunnel syndrome. Various imaging modalities revealed lunate sclerosis, edema, and ulnar negative variance, strongly indicative of KD. In this case, the patient decided to undergo a left distal radius shortening osteotomy to alleviate lunate compression and restore vascular perfusion. This case report highlights the multifactorial nature of KD, including anatomical, vascular, occupational, and genetic risk factors. Additionally, this case emphasizes the importance of tailoring treatment modalities based on disease severity as outlined by the Lichtman classification system. Given the limited literature on KD and the absence of standardized treatment guidelines, further research is necessary to optimize treatment strategies and improve clinical outcomes.",,,

This retrospective study aimed to investigate demographic characteristics, mechanisms of injury, management strategies, and outcomes in bladder trauma patients, with a focus on comparing the differences between blunt and penetrating trauma cases.  Data were collected from trauma patients presenting to Arrowhead Regional Medical Center between February 17, 2013, and October 30, 2022. Patients aged 18 years and older diagnosed with bladder rupture were included in the final analysis. Patient demographics, mechanisms of injury, and treatment modalities were analyzed to compare the differences in outcomes. Statistical analyses were conducted using the Statistical Analysis System software for Windows version 9.4 (SAS Inc., Cary, NC).  A total of 88 patients were included in the analysis. The majority of patients were men (n = 65, 73.9%), and blunt trauma accounted for 75% (n = 66) of cases. While there was a significantly higher proportion of men in penetrating trauma cases, differences in mortality, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, pulse, respiratory rate, oxygen saturation, Glasgow Coma Scale, injury severity score, and units of blood given were not statistically different between blunt and penetrating trauma cases.  There is no statistical difference in regard to outcomes between blunt and penetrating bladder trauma.

However, the literature has not comprehensively reported these applications, and the outcomes of conventional surgeries have not been compared with robot-assisted surgeries to determine efficacy. Therefore, this literature review aimed to find and compare outcomes. According to existing literature, robot-assisted surgery has brought significant changes to various aspects of general surgical practice. The research outcomes have shown that robotic surgery minimizes surgical invasiveness by enabling smaller incisions, reducing blood loss, and accelerating patient recovery. The da Vinci Surgical System has shown enhanced surgical accuracy due to better control when operating in complex cases such as colorectal resections, pancreaticoduodenectomy, and hernia repairs. The use of robotic systems enables surgeons to remain comfortable while performing complex procedures because the system allows them to maintain ergonomic body positions.

This study aims to evaluate clinical and demographic factors associated with survival outcomes in elderly burn patients within an Appalachian cohort. Methods A retrospective analysis was conducted on 198 patients aged ≥65 years admitted to a tertiary care center in Appalachia. Patient demographics, comorbidities, burn characteristics, and outcomes were analyzed. Bivariate analyses, including chi-square tests, t-tests, and Mann-Whitney U tests, were used to identify factors associated with discharge status (alive vs. deceased). Results The mean age of the cohort was 72.6 ± 6.1 years, with 65.2% male participants. The overall survival rate was 85.9%. Key findings included a statistically significant association between age and survival (p = 0.031), with older patients more likely to experience mortality. Inhalation injuries were strongly associated with increased mortality (p < 0.001). Patients who died had a higher median total burn surface area (TBSA) of 30.0% (interquartile range (IQR): 10.0-50.0) compared to 5.0% (IQR: 1.0-10.0) in survivors (p < 0.001). Other variables, including comorbidities, BMI, and burn source, did not demonstrate statistically significant associations with mortality. Conclusions Age, inhalation injury, and TBS were significant predictors of mortality in elderly burn patients. These findings underscore the importance of targeted interventions and resource allocation for high-risk patients, particularly in underserved regions like Appalachia.

40376279,Linguistic Markers of Autism Spectrum Disorder in Narrative Production: Evidence From the Monkey Cartoon Storytelling Task of the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule.,,Autism & developmental language impairments,10.1177/23969415251331045,"The Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS-2) is considered a ""gold standard"" diagnostic instrument in the assessment of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The Monkey Cartoon task is an optional pictured storytelling task in ADOS-2, which has been designed to assess gestural and verbal communication in autistic children while telling a story. It is well established that storytelling is challenging for autistic children, particularly for the content and coherent organization of the story, also known as narrative macrostructure. Existing evidence on the efficacy of the Monkey Cartoon task to pinpoint differences between autistic and neurotypical individuals in narrative macrostructure is scant. In this study, we used a version of the Monkey Cartoon task with modified scoring to analyze the narrative macrostructural skills of two groups of children with and without ASD. We also investigated the relations between narrative macrostructure and language ability in each group. A group of 16 Greek-speaking autistic children and 16 age- and IQ-matched neurotypical children were administered the Monkey Cartoon storytelling task. Children's vocabulary and syntactic skills were also measured. Narratives were analyzed in terms of macrostructural features, including story completeness and story grammar, as well as units denoting the setting, internal responses and added details. The autistic children had lower scores in communicating the story content rather than story grammar. Moreover, the autistic group tended to include less information on the story's setting and more off-topic utterances than their neurotypical peers. Regarding the relations between narrative macrostructure and language ability, the two groups dissociated since the autistic children tended to rely on vocabulary at the expense of including irrelevant information in their narratives, while neurotypical children relied on both lexical and syntactic skills, especially when instantiating references to the story characters' mental states and the setting of the story, respectively. The Monkey Cartoon storytelling task seems to be efficient at revealing pragmatic weaknesses mainly at the thematic content level in autistic children. Also, the frequent use of semantically- and pragmatically-irrelevant information in storytelling differentiated autistic from neurotypical children, and may thus be treated as a distinguishing feature of ASD in narrative production. The findings demonstrate the viability of the Monkey Cartoon task in highlighting language markers of ASD in narrative macrostructure, with clinical implications for enhancing clinical practice in countries like Greece that face a shortage of narrative assessment tools for autistic children.",Drakoulaki K; Boznou A; Nerantzini M,,

Imaging methods and practice,10.1093/ehjimp/qyaf047,"Perivascular adipose tissue attenuation (PVAT) has emerged as a novel coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA)-based biomarker predicting cardiovascular events by capturing inflammation around the coronary arteries. We assessed whether PVAT adds incremental prognostic value in patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI). A total of 510 patients underwent CCTA imaging prior to TAVI between November 2015 and June 2020 at the Medical University of Vienna. PVAT was obtained from CCTA images and was measured around the right coronary artery [PVAT(RCA)] and the aortic valve [PVAT(valve)]. Following application of exclusion criteria, 372 patients [mean age 80.6 ± 6.8 years; 169 (45%) women] were analysed. Over a median follow-up of 3.0 (IQR 2.5-3.6) years, 52 (14%) individuals experienced a major adverse cardiovascular event (MACE, a composite of non-fatal stroke or myocardial infarction, cardiac death, or vascular intervention). Individuals exhibiting elevated PVAT[valve] displayed a heightened surgical risk according to European System for Cardiac Operative Risk Evaluation II, a lower body mass index, reduced left ventricular ejection fraction, prolonged hospitalization following TAVI, and elevated levels of circulating inflammatory markers compared with those in the low PVAT[valve] group ( Measuring PVAT around either the right coronary artery or the aortic valve does not provide additional prognostic value beyond established risk factors for the prediction of MACE in patients undergoing TAVI.",,,

Y.)",10.1002/trc2.70095,"Meaningful benefit is a much-debated concept in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Research to date has primarily focused on change thresholds that are anchored in clinicians' or care partners' impressions; however, these thresholds are not inherently meaningful to people living with AD (PLWAD) and may not take their perspectives into account. By overlaying the lived experience of AD through the eyes of individual PLWAD and their care partners with clinical outcomes, we offer an important framework in which to consider meaningful benefit in terms of symptoms, functioning, and outcomes. The PLWAD and care partner interviews and surveys of the What Matters Most (WMM) research program have identified treatment-related needs, preferences, and priorities of people at risk of or living with AD and their care partners across the AD continuum. A WMM conceptual model of disease-created and refined through interviews with PLWAD and care partners across the AD severity spectrum-includes 50 concepts across six domains (social life/activities, thought processing, communication, daily activities, mood/emotion, and general independence) considered important to all PLWAD and care partners. From the PLWAD and care partner perspectives, an increase in time to the onset, development, or worsening of the symptoms in any of these meaningful concepts was considered a meaningful benefit. No single commonly used clinical outcome assessment captures all concepts of importance, nor the importance of time in AD; considering the lived experience and priorities of individuals affected by AD is crucial to put the ""meaning"" in ""meaningful.""",Paulsen R; Romano CD; Frangiosa T; Mordin M; Dardis GJ; DiBenedetti D; Petersen RC,Department of Neurology Mayo Clinic Rochester Minnesota USA.; Faegre Drinker Consulting Washington District of Columbia USA.; UsAgainstAlzheimer's Washington District of Columbia USA.; RTI Health Solutions Durham North Carolina USA.,

Amid historic federal disinvestment in research and persistent cultural resistance to industry collaboration, the traditional academic compact, based on grants, publications, and tenure, is no longer sustainable. Drawing on firsthand experience as a medical school dean, faculty, and biotech executive, this editorial argues that academic institutions must urgently reform how they value and support entrepreneurial scholarship. With fewer than 1% of university patents leading to licensed products, the prevailing model of late-stage, passive tech transfer has failed to translate innovation into impact. Meanwhile, global models from the Israel Innovation Authority to Singapore's Biopolis demonstrate the power of early, structured academia-industry partnerships. This piece proposes a new framework for evaluating faculty achievement, one that elevates patents, startups, regulatory wins, clinical product launches, and translational teaching as core academic contributions. It calls for institutional reforms to faculty appointment and promotion criteria, dedicated innovation offices, and policy incentives to reward real-world impact. The innovation imperative is clear: if academic medicine is to remain relevant, it must become an engine not only of knowledge, but of change.",Lakhan SE,Medical Office,

Consequently, ensuring medicinal plants' quality, efficacy, and safety has become a critical concern for developed and developing nations. The emergence of multidrug-resistant microorganisms poses a serious global health threat, particularly in low-income regions, despite significant advancements in antimicrobial drugs and medical research over the past century. The rapid spread of these multidrug-resistant infections is primarily attributed to improper prescriptions, overuse, and unregulated access to antibiotics. Addressing these challenges, the standardization of plant-derived pharmaceuticals could pave the way for a transformative era in healthcare. Preserving and leveraging the historical knowledge of medicinal plants is essential before such valuable information is lost. Recently, there has been growing interest among natural and pharmaceutical scientists in exploring medicinal plants as potential sources of antimicrobial agents.

The aim of this study was to assess and compare the status of implementation and performance of the regulatory functions for registration and marketing authorization as well as the system for approval of blood, blood components and plasma for fractionation or processes. We did this by conducting assisted self-benchmarking in 12 African countries using the GBT plus Blood (registration and marketing authorization function, 34 sub-indicators and approval of blood, blood components, and plasma for fractionation or processes function, 24 sub-indicators). Comparative assessments of WHO-designated maturity level 3 (ML3) NRAs for medicines and vaccines against non-designated NRAs were made. The percentage of implemented sub-indicators was higher for the registration and marketing authorization function with an average implementation score of 73% (range: 51%-92%) compared to the approval of blood, blood components, and plasma for fractionation or processes function which had an average implementation score of 45% (range: 6%-65%). The comparison of group averages for the ML3-designated NRAs against the non-designated NRAs revealed a higher score 91% (range: 71%-100%) for ML3-designated NRAs as opposed to a lower score of 71% (range: 49%-100%) for the non-designated NRAs for the registration and marketing authorization function. This pattern, however, was not observed for the comparison of group averages for the approval of blood, blood components, and plasma for fractionation or processes function where the ML3-designated NRAs scored 47% (range 19%-72%) against 46% (range 23%-88%) for the non-ML3-designated NRAs. Most of the NRAs excelled in implementing sub-indicators for the registration and marketing authorization (of plasma-derived medicines) function. All NRAs exhibited notable flaws in regulating blood, blood components, plasma for fraction, and approval of processes, indicating nascent regulatory frameworks.

A web-based survey of professional organizations affiliated with the Inter-Society Coordinating Committee for Practitioner Education in Genomics (ISCC-PEG), a U.S.-based initiative coordinated by the National Human Genome Research Institute, targeted representatives who could reflect their organization's educational stance. Of the 34 unique responses analyzed, most organizations provided general and genomic education (94.1% and 82.4%, respectively), and 70.6% offered PGx-specific education. Most (61.8%) indicated they either needed major additions to the education they provide or had no PGx education resources. Key barriers included a lack of PGx focus within organizations (78.1%) and challenges in maintaining an up-to-date curriculum (75.0%). Preferred educational formats were live webinars (84.4%), hybrid courses (78.1%), and self-study modules (78.1%). Our study identifies gaps in PGx education across professional organizations and underscores the need for resources to advance clinician competence in PGx. While some PGx education is available, many organizations require additional resources and support. Enhancing PGx education through targeted initiatives by organizations like ISCC-PEG may improve clinician competence and the integration of PGx into clinical practice. Pharmacogenomics (PGx) is the study of how a person’s genes affect their response to medications. PGx testing may help make treatments safer and more effective. However, many healthcare professionals do not feel confident using PGx in their practice, mostly due to limited education and training. To understand what education is currently available, this study surveyed professional healthcare organizations that are part of the Inter-Society Coordinating Committee for Practitioner Education in Genomics (ISCC-PEG), a group focused on improving genomics education in the U.S. This study collected information on what PGx education organizations offer, what barriers they face, and what kind of resources they need. Most organizations indicated they offer some education, but many felt they need more PGx training materials. They also indicated it can be hard to keep up with new information and that PGx is not always a focus within their organization. When asked what type of education would help the most, organizations said they prefer live webinars, self-paced online courses, and hybrid learning options. This study shows that more PGx education is needed from the professional societies to help healthcare providers stay up to date in their training and to help them feel confident using genetic information to guide medication decisions. Groups like ISCC-PEG can help by working with professional organizations to create and share up-to-date educational tools.",,,

This study aimed to evaluate the worldwide changes in the burden of NDs attributable to air pollution from 1990 to 2021. The 2021 Global Burden of Disease Study (GBD) reported neonatal deaths attributable to air pollution and the associated age-standardized rates and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs). To assess the global burden of NDs and the subtypes, age-standardized DALY rates (ASDARs) and age-standardized death rates (ASDRs) were employed. The estimated annual percentage change (EAPC) was used to track global and regional temporal trends from 1990 to 2021. Spearman's rank correlation coefficients were applied to evaluate the relationship between the sociodemographic index (SDI), ASDARs, and ASDRs for NDs. The slope inequality index and concentration index were derived from health inequality analyses to measure international disparities. Finally, frontier analysis were employed to determine optimal burden for NDs at corresponding SDI levels. In 2021, the air pollution-related NDs resulted in 496,966 deaths and 44,737,311 DALYs worldwide. The burden for NDs showed a decreasing trend globally in past three decades. Neonatal preterm birth was the most severe subtype of NDs in 2021. With the global and regional increase in the SDI, the ASDR and ASDAR for five NDs subtypes have decreased. Significant absolute and relative income disparities in the burden of DALYs and mortality due to NDs were observed worldwide. Frontier analysis indicated inverse correlations between the ASDR/ASDAR and SDI, with the Solomon Islands, a low SDI country, showing the smallest overall differences. Although the burden of air pollution-induced NDs has decreased, it remains a significant public health concern, with regional disparities. More nuanced policies and preventive measures are needed to reduce the burden of NDs.",,,yquan646908@gmail.com.

These centres operate at the intersection of clinical care and academic innovation, combining personalised diagnostics and therapy with the evaluation and integration of emerging technologies. As the demand for sleep-related healthcare continues to grow, sleep centres must evolve to accommodate both increasing patient loads and rapid technological advancements. Outpatient departments serve as critical entry points for patients, enabling structured assessments through consultations, questionnaires and objective tools such as actigraphy and home polygraphy. These are increasingly complemented by digital solutions, including telemedicine, automated sleep diaries and remote prescription management. Such tools improve accessibility, streamline workflows and enhance continuity of care. Despite technological progress, sleep laboratories remain indispensable for diagnosing complex disorders like sleep apnea and hypersomnias, where in-lab polysomnography and real-time therapy adjustments are essential. However, advances in portable and wearable devices are creating viable home-based alternatives for selected cases, contributing to reduced lab wait times and broader patient reach. Research and education are foundational to advancing the field. Ongoing updates to sleep medicine curricula, alongside rigorous clinical studies on novel diagnostics and AI tools, ensure that care remains evidence-based and future-ready. Sleep centres, as multidisciplinary hubs, will continue to merge clinical practice, innovation and training-shaping a future where sleep healthcare is more personalised, data-driven and accessible without compromising quality or equity.

SDB, which comprises obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA), more rarely central sleep apnoea (CSA), and nocturnal alveolar hypoventilation (NH), may present at any age in patients with achondroplasia. Untreated SDB is associated with neurocognitive dysfunction, cardiovascular, and metabolic complications in children and adults. There continues to be debate on the optimal assessment and management of SDB in achondroplasia. To help address this, the European Achondroplasia Forum (EAF), a network of clinicians and patient advocates representative of the achondroplasia clinical community, organised a virtual workshop in October 2023 to scrutinise, vote and agree upon five guiding principles for managing SDB in achondroplasia. This workshop was attended by 40 healthcare professionals, including clinical geneticists, general practitioners and consultants, orthodontic and orthopaedic surgeons, paediatricians, paediatric endocrinologists and pulmonologists, sleep researchers and specialists, and two patient advocacy group representatives. The five guiding principles focus on lifelong assessment and proactive management, incorporating individualised sleep studies, screening, and a stepwise approach to therapeutic management. The EAF was in favour of all guiding principles, with all achieving 100% consensus with high levels of agreement (range 8.9-9.7/10).

Nurse-to-nurse clinical handover is frequently implemented at inpatient and emergency units, with an increased risk of information loss. Ineffective clinical handover is responsible for about 80% of the causes of serious, preventable adverse health events. However, the evidence is unknown in Ethiopia, particularly in the study setting. Therefore, this study aimed to explore the lived experience of clinical handover among nurses working in the Jimma Medical Center in South Western Ethiopia in 2022. This study employed a descriptive phenomenological approach to explore the lived experiences of nurses in medical, surgical, and emergency outpatient departments. Data collection occurred between July 1st and August 31st, 2022. Nine nurses, purposively selected for their diverse experiences, participated in individual, semi-structured, in-depth interviews. To provide additional context, five key informants were also interviewed. Additionally, twenty non-participatory observations were conducted. Interview recordings and field notes were transcribed verbatim and analyzed using Colaizzi's seven-step method, facilitated by Atlas.ti 8 software. Rigor was ensured through adherence to Lincoln and Guba's criteria for trustworthiness. Findings are presented through thematic narratives supported by direct participant quotations.

This study evaluates and compares the clinical outcomes and cost-effectiveness of Korean and Western medicine collaborative treatment (CT) with usual care (UC) for patients with facial palsy (FP). A two-arm comparative, multicenter, prospective, observational study was conducted at 11 nationwide hospitals participating in the fourth phase of the national pilot project for CT. A total of 130 FP patients were enrolled at baseline, with follow-up assessments at 4 weeks and 12 weeks post-baseline. Clinical outcomes were evaluated using the House-Brackmann Grading Scale (HBGS), Numeric Rating Scale (NRS), EuroQol-5 Dimensions (EQ-5D-5L), and EuroQol-Visual Analogue Scale (EQ-VAS) at all three time points of the study. The cost-effectiveness evaluation was assessed using Cost per QALYs (Quality-Adjusted Life Years), Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratio (ICER), and Net Monetary Benefit (NMB). The mean HBGS, NRS and EQ-VAS scores significantly improved in both groups over time (each, p < 0.05). Compared to UC, CT demonstrated significantly higher EQ-5D-5L scores (0.94 ± 0.11 vs. 0.91 ± 0.13), and this effect remained significant even after adjusting for age, sex, duration, and income level (β = 0.06, p < 0.05). From a limited societal perspective, the total cost difference between the two groups was not statistically significant; however, the QALYs gained were significantly higher in patients who received CT than those who received UC (0.010 QALYs vs. 0.008 QALYs). The ICER for CT was estimated at 28.1 million Korean Won (KRW) per QALY. The probability that CT would be more cost-effective than UC exceeded 50% at a WTP threshold of 30.5 million KRW per QALY. Our study highlights that CT enhances a better quality of life and is more cost-effective for FP treatment, suggesting it is a valuable alternative to usual care.

How ostracism influences nurses' willingness to suggest new ideas or adopt innovative practices is not fully understood. Therefore, this study aimed to determine the level and predictors of quality of nursing care and evaluate its correlation with workplace ostracism and innovative work behavior. A cross-sectional correlational descriptive study involving 266 conveniently sampled nurses was conducted in three public hospitals in Hail City, Saudi Arabia. This study followed the STROBE Checklist. Data were collected using a questionnaire that included three tools: Workplace Ostracism Scale, Innovative Work Behavior Scale, and Quality of Nursing Care Scale. Pearson's correlation coefficient was used to determine the relationships between study variables. Furthermore, multiple linear regression analysis was conducted using innovative work behavior and gender as independent variables. Statistical significance was set at a p-value of < 0.05. The ostracism level was high among the nurses (50.38%), half of them had a negative IWB (51.10%), and (41.40%) had a mild level of quality of care. Ostracism was negatively and significantly correlated with the quality of care (rs=-0.159, p = 0.009) and IWB (rs=-0.146, p = 0.017). Furthermore, IWB among nurses was positively correlated with the quality of care (rs = 0.376, p < 0.001). Multiple linear regression revealed that the IWB was considered a significant factor in the quality of care (B = 0.187) at p-value < 0.001. This study found a negative relationship between workplace ostracism and innovative work behavior, which shows that nursing may seek innovation as a way of dealing with stressful exclusion circumstances. It was set up that the ""idea sustainability"" dimension of innovative work behavior is the most dominant predictor of the sustainability of nursing care's quality, which underlines the need to build on innovative ideas for improvement in nursing quality of care. To improve nurses' performance, health organizations must focus on strategies that block workplace ostracism and integrate innovative work behaviors in their nurses.

40375176,CuddleCard: Protocol for a randomized controlled trial evaluating the effect of providing financial support to low-income mothers of preterm infants on parental caregiving in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU).,2025-05-16,BMC pediatrics,10.1186/s12887-025-05621-9,"Preterm birth is a leading cause of childhood mortality and developmental disabilities, with persistent socioeconomic disparities in incidence and outcomes. Maternal presence during prolonged neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) hospitalization is critical for preterm infant health, enabling mothers to provide breast milk, directly breastfeed, and engage in skin-to-skin care-all of which promote infant physiological stability and neurodevelopment. Low-income mothers face significant barriers to visiting the NICU and participating in caregiving due to financial burdens and the psychological impact of financial stress. This randomized controlled trial aims to evaluate the effectiveness of financial transfers in promoting maternal caregiving behaviors that directly impact preterm infant health outcomes during NICU hospitalization. We will conduct a two-arm, single-blinded randomized controlled trial with 420 Medicaid-eligible mothers of infants born between 24 weeks 0 days to 34 weeks 1 day gestation across four Level 3 NICUs in Georgia and Massachusetts. Mothers in the intervention arm will receive standard of care enhanced with weekly financial transfers and will be informed that these funds are intended to help them spend more time with their infants in the NICU. All participants will be provided with a hospital-grade breast pump and educational materials on the benefits of breast milk and skin-to-skin care. Participants will complete surveys during their infant's hospitalization and following discharge, capturing outcomes related to maternal mental and physical health, caregiving behaviors, cognitive function, financial and socioeconomic factors, infant health and growth, and perceptions of NICU care quality. Primary outcomes are the provision of breast milk and engagement in skin-to-skin care. Secondary outcomes include infant growth and health outcomes, NICU visitation, financial and socioeconomic hardship, maternal physical and mental health measures, cognitive function, and perception of NICU care quality. This study will provide evidence of the impact of financial transfers on maternal caregiving behaviors in the NICU, addressing critical gaps in our understanding of how financial stress affects low-income mothers. Findings may inform health policy, particularly regarding Medicaid coverage of non-medical services, and contribute to understanding how to address disparities in preterm infant care.

In this study, we aim to provide global, regional, and national estimates of the mental disorders burden from 1990 to 2021, including during the COVID-19. We collected data from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2021 (GBD 2021) on the incidence, disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), age-standardized incidence rate (ASIR), and age-standardized DALY rate (ASR) of 12 mental disorders from 204 countries and regions. The socio-demographic index (SDI) was used to evaluate the correlation between mental disorders burden and different regions. We utilized joinpoint regression analysis to estimate the average annual percentage change (AAPC). In 2021, there were 444,397,716 incident cases and 155,418,119 DALYs globally from mental disorders. From 1990 to 2021, there was an upward trend in both ASIR [15.23% (12.97-17.60%)] and ASR [17.28% (15.06-19.44%)]. In 2021, the highest ASIR was observed in Central Sub-Saharan Africa (8706.11), while the lowest was in East Asia (3340.99). Australia (2787.87) had the highest ASR. Nationally, Greenland, Greece, the United States, and Australia had the highest ASRs. During the COVID-19 pandemic, aside from East Asia, both the ASIR showed an upward trend in the five SDI and other GBD regions. In 2021, the ASR for females was higher than that for males. Among the 12 subtypes, major depressive disorder (557.87) and anxiety disorders (524.33) had the highest ASR. Major depressive disorder ranked first in ASR in 13 of the 21 regions worldwide. Despite the overall upward trend in DALYs for mental disorders [AAPC: 5.96; 95%CI: (4.99, 6.92)], the ASR exhibited varying trends among different subtypes, with anxiety disorders experiencing the most significant increase. GBD 2021 showed that the burden of mental disorders has increased over the past three decades, with notable regional disparities. High SDI regions and females should be paid more attention. To alleviate future burdens, providing comprehensive mental health support, establishing effective mental health knowledge dissemination and tailored interventions are in great need.

Nevertheless, parasite detection in snails is hampered by challenges in snail sampling and low infection rates, mainly in moderate and low-endemic areas, as well as requiring specialized personnel and being time-consuming. Thus, there is a need to improve tools to assist schistosomiasis surveillance and an environmental DNA (eDNA) approach may help to overcome these limitations. Here, we standardized and used an eDNA-based approach to monitor Schistosoma mansoni occurrence in two schistosomiasis endemic areas from Minas Gerais, Brazil. The eDNA approach was standardized for local conditions by evaluating the specificity of the qPCR assay in detecting the parasite DNA. Water from snail breeding tanks containing Biomphalaria glabrata, either infected or not with S. mansoni, was used to standardize the eDNA filtration and extraction protocols. Three molecular techniques- Low-Stringency PCR (LS-PCR), Loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP), and quantitative PCR (qPCR)- were applied to investigate samples from snail tanks and two field surveys. Additionally, malacological surveys and measurements of water physicochemical and microbiological parameters were conducted at the same locations to know the species of mollusks present and the ideal environmental conditions to identify hotspots. The qPCR assay was specifically amplified Schistosoma sp. DNA without amplifying other trematodes presents in Brazil, ensuring accurate detection without cross-amplification. All three molecular assays efficiently detected S. mansoni DNA only from eDNA samples from tanks with infected snails. The eDNA approach, associated with LAMP and qPCR assays, successfully identified S. mansoni DNA at the same collection points where snails releasing cercariae were found and at one additional site, that was missed by traditional methods, underscoring its sensitivity. This study illustrates the potential of employing eDNA sampling combined with molecular techniques as an effective strategy for monitoring and identifying potential schistosomiasis transmission foci in endemic areas. This approach aligns with the WHO's roadmap for schistosomiasis elimination by 2030 and has implications for public health interventions and control measures.",Gava SG; de Carvalho IR; Fava NMN; Parreiras PM; de Oliveira AA; Teixeira SSF; Lourenço AJ; Carvalho ODS; Montresor LC; Mourão MM; Caldeira RL,Instituto René Rachou- Fiocruz Minas; Grupo de Pesquisa em Helmintologia e Malacologia Médica; Grupo de Pesquisa em Diagnóstico e Terapia de Doenças Infecciosas e Câncer; Grupo de Pesquisa em Políticas Públicas e Direitos Humanos; Moluscário Lobato Paraense,sandra.grossi@fiocruz.br.

This study aims to investigate the relationship between attachment, perceived rejection, and psychological security with BPD. This cross-sectional correlational study was conducted on 89 BPD patients. The BPD patients was selected using a convenience sampling method. The instruments used in this study included the demographic characteristics form, the Rejection Sensitivity Perception Scale (RSPS), the Revised Adult Attachment Scale (RAAS), the Maslow's Psychological Security scale and the Borderline Personality Inventory (BPI). Data were analyzed using SPSS version 22, employing Pearson correlation and regression analysis methods. The mean scores of BPI were 25.59 ± 5.19. The mean scores for perceived rejection and attachment were 7.71 ± 3.52 and 35.76 ± 6.64, respectively. We found a positive significant correlation between perceived rejection (r = 0.35, p = 0.001), attachment (r = 0.25, p = 0.017) and psychological and social security (r = 0.55, p < 0.001) with BPI. The results of multivariate linear regression indicated that psychological and social security, perceived rejection, and gender predicted 40% of the variance in BPD (R² = 40%) (p < 0.05). In the present study, attachment, rejection, and sense of security were found to be associated with BPD. To prevent BPD, it is essential to consider factors such as attachment, rejection, and security. Therefore, mental health care providers are advised to plan and implement appropriate interventions to identify and improve these variables, thereby enhancing related health outcomes.",,,rezamohammadmehr@gmail.com.

This has a potentially high impact in the WHO African Region. However, there is a need for a viable strategy to leverage vaccines in addressing AMR in the region. We conducted a scoping review to map existing evidence on the role of vaccines in combating AMR in the WHO African Region, identify critical knowledge gaps, and propose priority areas for research and policy interventions. We systematically reviewed the literature to identify studies that have been published in this area, with no date or study design restriction. The search results were screened for eligibility, and data from eligible studies were extracted and synthesised following the PRISMA Extension for Scoping Reviews. A total of 10 studies were included in this review. Seven studies either focused on Africa as a whole or were multi-regional studies that included Africa, with country-specific studies mostly from South Africa and Ethiopia. Four studies focused on pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCV), while others examined influenza, rotavirus, respiratory syncytial virus, tuberculosis, and Klebsiella pneumoniae vaccines. Five studies estimated the potential impact of vaccines on AMR, focusing on outcomes such as reductions in AMR burden, disease incidence, deaths due to resistant pathogens, and antibiotic consumption. The remaining studies examined economic value and potential role in antimicrobial stewardship programmes. Three studies addressed policy-related issues, including potential barriers and collaboration between AMR and vaccination programmes. This review underscores the need for more country-level studies to build evidence on vaccine impact on AMR, including cost-effectiveness studies. Research priorities should include clinical trials with AMR-related endpoints and evaluation of vaccine impact during new vaccine introductions. Strengthening AMR surveillance systems and enhancing collaboration between AMR and vaccination programmes are crucial.

Several supervised machine learning models involve hyper-parameters, whose values must be judiciously specified to ensure adequate predictive performance. To compare several (nine) hyper-parameter optimization (HPO) methods, for tuning the hyper-parameters of an extreme gradient boosting model, with application to predicting high-need high-cost health care users. Extreme gradient boosting models were estimated using a randomly sampled training dataset. Models were separately trained using nine different HPO methods: 1) random sampling, 2) simulated annealing, 3) quasi-Monte Carlo sampling, 4-5) two variations of Bayesian hyper-parameter optimization via tree-Parzen estimation, 6-7) two implementations of Bayesian hyper-parameter optimization via Gaussian processes, 8) Bayesian hyper-parameter optimization via random forests, and 9) the covariance matrix adaptation evolutionary strategy. For each HPO method, we estimated 100 extreme gradient boosting models at different hyper-parameter configurations; and evaluated model performance using an AUC metric on a randomly sampled validation dataset. Using the best model identified by each HPO method, we evaluated generalization performance in terms of discrimination and calibration metrics on a randomly sampled held-out test dataset (internal validation) and a temporally independent dataset (external validation). The extreme gradient boosting model estimated using default hyper-parameter settings had reasonable discrimination (AUC=0.82) but was not well calibrated. Hyper-parameter tuning using any HPO algorithm/sampler improved model discrimination (AUC=0.84), resulted in models with near perfect calibration, and consistently identified features predictive of high-need high-cost health care users. In our study, all HPO algorithms resulted in similar gains in model performance relative to baseline models. This finding likely relates to our study dataset having a large sample size, a relatively small number of features, and a strong signal to noise ratio; and would likely apply to other datasets with similar characteristics.",Wang X; Guan J; Stukel TA,ICES,christopher.meaney@utoronto.ca.

Cross sectional study using data from the 2022 National Health and Wellness Survey, an online survey of Spanish residents aged 18 or older. Respondents diagnosed with migraine by a physician and who reported at least one migraine in the past year were considered active migraine cases. The study included 7,002 respondents, 930 of whom had physician-diagnosed active migraine. The estimated one-year prevalence of migraine in Spain was 13.1% (95% confidence interval [CI] 12.8-13.4%), with higher rates in females (17.7%, 95% CI 17.2-18.3%) than in males (8.2%, 95% CI 7.8-8.6%). Migraine prevalence varied across Spain's regions, ranging from 8.1% (95% CI 5.2-11.0%) in Navarre to 19.1% in Cantabria (95% CI 15.6-22.6%). Prevalence was the highest among individuals earning below the median income (14.7%, 95% CI 14.1-15.4%). In the preceding month, 75.3% of patients experienced < 4 migraine days, 15.3% 4-9 migraine days, 4.1% 10-14 migraine days, and 5.3% ≥15 migraine days. Severe disability from migraine was reported by 20.4% of respondents. One in ten people reported using a preventive treatment for migraine. The mean SF-12 scores for mental and physical health were 37.8 and 42.1, respectively, both below the general population norm of 50. The mean EQ-5D summary score was 0.8, indicating reduced quality of life and the PHQ-9 detected severe depressive symptoms in 8.8% of individuals.

One reason for this difference is related to the challenges in learning and integrating the needs and preferences of PLWD into clinical care. We aimed to obtain a range of perspectives on the challenges in supporting PLWD in hospital and explore opportunities for improvement. Using an exploratory qualitative study design, we conducted interviews with nine people supporting PLWD (current / ex-spouses or children of PLWD) and 11 nursing, medical and allied health staff members at a single Australian hospital. Data were thematically analysed using a framework approach. Participants described how best practice in supporting PLWD included understanding and integrating patient needs and highlighted the importance of family and the multidisciplinary team working in partnership. A number of factors inhibiting quality care provision were described, including uncertainty around responsibility for communicating with families to understand needs of PLWD; unsuitable tools; lack of opportunities for families to communicate with staff; and, resource and environmental constraints. Participants discussed potential for improvement, emphasising the need for a pre-emptive, rather than reactive solution. They expressed support for the idea of a 'hospital admission kit', containing both information about PLWD and their familiar items. Implementation considerations were also noted, with various perspectives on the timing of initiation, updating, responsible person(s), format, content and how it should be incorporated into clinical workflows. We found that hospital staff and those supporting PLWD felt that integrating the needs and preferences of PLWD into hospital care was important. The concept of a pre-prepared 'toolkit' that was ready in the case of a need to attend hospital was felt to be valid and potentially helpful. More work is required to design aspects such as format, content and the workflows needed to generate accountability and reliability in creating, updating and incorporating it into hospital care.

Younger patients often face diagnostic delays and receive care pathways designed for older populations. These gaps highlight the need for tailored approaches to diagnosis, treatment, and support. This study aimed to explore the lived experiences and challenges of eoCRC patients across seven European countries to inform public health strategies and improve patient-centered care. We conducted qualitative focus groups with 47 eoCRC patients and survivors from France, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Romania, Spain, and the United Kingdom. Discussions were analyzed using a thematic approach, focusing on three stages of the patient journey: pre-diagnosis, diagnosis, and post-diagnosis. Participants highlighted several key challenges, including low awareness of CRC symptoms among younger populations, diagnostic delays linked to age and gender biases, and limited access to age-appropriate support services. Many participants reported significant quality-of-life (QoL) impacts related to disrupted careers, intimacy issues, and challenges managing family responsibilities during treatment. Psychological support, physiotherapy, and nutritional counseling were inconsistently available, with significant disparities across public and private healthcare systems. The findings underscore the urgent need for targeted public health campaigns to raise awareness of eoCRC, improved training for healthcare providers to reduce diagnostic delays, and expanded access to tailored support services.

Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), with its over two millennia of clinical practice in China, has gained attention as a potential adjunctive approach for sepsis. Here, we evaluated TCM applications in sepsis management, highlighting both potential benefits and methodological limitations of existing clinical evidence. Although various TCM preparations have been evaluated for sepsis treatment, the vast majority lack robust clinical evidence. Xuebijing Injection represents a rare example that has demonstrated efficacy in a large-scale, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. In contrast, the evidence supporting other preparations such as Shenfu and Shenmai Injections comes primarily from smaller, single-center studies with significant methodological limitations. There is a clear need for more high-quality, multicenter randomized controlled trials to rigorously evaluate these potentially beneficial but currently insufficiently validated TCM preparations. The pharmacological effects and underlying mechanisms of some bioactive compounds derived from TCM medications have been elucidated, shedding light on the potential of TCM-based anti-sepsis drug discovery. We underscore the importance of continued research to better integrate TCM with modern sepsis management, paving the way for the development of evidence-based TCM treatments for this challenging condition.",,,yunji@zju.edu.cn.

In this study, we compared the ARC-HBR and J-HBR criteria for predicting post-discharge bleeding and associated events in patients with ACS. We retrospectively analyzed data from 889 patients with ACS discharged alive at two tertiary hospitals in Japan between August 2009 and July 2018. We identified patients with HBR using both sets of criteria. We compared the incidence of major bleeding/all-cause death within 2 years following discharge and performance metrics between each set of criteria, and explored the efficacy of combining both sets of criteria to stratify risk levels for the prediction of clinical events. Eighty patients experienced major bleeding/all-cause death. In the ARC-HBR and J-HBR criteria, 51% and 65% of patients were categorized as HBR, respectively. Both sets of criteria effectively identified patients at a high risk of major bleeding/all-cause death. The ARC-HBR demonstrated a significantly higher area under the curve (AUC) for major bleeding and all-cause death combined (AUC [95% confidence interval]: 0.67 [0.64-0.69]) than that of the J-HBR (0.63 [0.60-0.66], P = 0.015). In each component, while the AUC for major bleeding was comparable between the two sets of criteria (0.61 [0.57-0.64] vs. 0.61 [0.57-0.63], P = 0.95), the ARC-HBR criteria showed a significantly higher AUC for all-cause death than the J-HBR criteria (0.67 [0.64-0.70] vs. 0.61 [0.59-0.64], P < 0.001). The combined use of both sets of criteria effectively stratified the risk for major bleeding/all-cause death (hazard ratio [95% confident interval]: 5.81 [2.79-12.07] in those positive for both sets of criteria, compared to those negative in both sets of criteria).

Shigella infections are becoming increasing difficult to treat due to antimicrobial resistance (AMR), leading to an urgent need for new antimicrobial agents with novel modes of action. Shigella pathogenesis is largely intracellular and antibacterial chemicals that preferentially work inside cells may be desirable to limit collateral AMR and block key components of the Shigella infection cycle. Aiming to facilitate the process of identifying antibacterial chemicals that kill intracellular Shigella, we developed a high-throughput screening (HTS) cell-based chemical screening assay. The three-dimensional (3-D) assay, incorporating Shigella invasion into Caco-2 cells on Cytodex 3 beads, was scaled into a 384-well platform for screening chemical compound libraries. Using this assay, we evaluated >500,000 compounds, identifying 12 chemical hits that inhibit Shigella replication inside cells.

Although selection on heterozygotes is well-established in autosomal-dominant disorders, convincing evidence for selection in carriers of pathogenic variants associated with recessive conditions is limited. Here, we studied heterozygous pathogenic variants in 1,929 genes, which cause recessive diseases when bi-allelic, in n = 378,751 unrelated European individuals from the UK Biobank. We find evidence suggesting fitness effects in heterozygous carriers for recessive genes, especially for variants in constrained genes across a broad range of diseases. Our data suggest reproductive effects at the population level, and hence natural selection, for autosomal-recessive disease variants. Further, variants in genes that underlie intellectual disability are associated with lower educational attainment in carriers, and we observe an altered genetic landscape, characterized by a threefold reduction in the calculated frequency of bi-allelic intellectual disability in the population relative to other recessive disorders.",,,Christian.Gilissen@radboudumc.nl.

Systematic reviews published between January, 2012, and September, 2024, were identified through searches across nine databases (Ovid Embase, Ovid MEDLINE, ProQuest PsycINFO, Epistemonikos, Cochrane, Health Evidence, DoPHER, PROSPERO, and CINAHL via EBSCO), and the results were imported into Covidence software. Inclusion criteria included systematic reviews of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) involving patients of all ages with Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis, using DHT for diagnostics, treatment support, monitoring, self-management, or increasing participation in research studies, compared with standard care or alternative interventions. Outcomes included the efficacy and effectiveness of digital interventions, as reported in the studies. The primary outcome was clinical efficacy reported as one or more of the following: clinical response or remission, disease activity, flare-ups or relapses, and quality of life. Secondary outcomes included medication adherence, number of health-care visits, patient engagement (satisfaction and adherence or compliance with interventions), attendance for all terms of engagement, rate of interactions, knowledge improvement, psychological outcomes, and cost or cost-time effectiveness. The review protocol was registered in PROSPERO (registration number: CRD42023417525). AMSTAR-2 was used for methodological quality assessment. Nine relevant reviews were included, including five with meta-analyses comprising 13-19 RCTs in each review; four reviews were rated as high quality and five as critically low quality. DHT was not directly beneficial in achieving or maintaining clinical remission in IBD. In four trials, DHT use was associated with a reduced number of hospital attendances and increased treatment adherence, supporting its role as an adjuvant to standard clinical practice in IBD. Although current evidence from several RCTs and systematic reviews does not indicate better clinical outcomes with DHT in maintaining IBD remission and reducing relapse rates, DHT could be used as an adjuvant resource contributing towards treatment adherence and reducing hospital visits.",Narula P,Department of Paediatric Gastroenterology,naila.arebi@imperial.ac.uk.

We conducted a single center retrospective cohort study of 186 patients with cardiac amyloidosis, of which 62 had ATTRwt-CA, diagnosed at our institution between 2/2010 and 4/2023. We compared clinical, laboratory, electrocardiographic, and echocardiographic characteristics between Black and non-Black ATTRwt-CA patients. Our primary outcome of interest was all cause mortality. Of the 62 patients with ATTRwt-CA, 19 patients self-identified as Black. Black ATTRwt-CA patients had higher rates of chronic kidney disease (63.2 % vs 23.3 %; p = 0.002), lower glomerular filtration rate (50.8 ± 18.0 vs 63.3 ± 18.4; p = 0.019), and lower rates of carpal tunnel syndrome (36.8 % vs 67.4 %; p = 0.024). There were no significant differences in disease stage (p = 0.058), frequency of NYHA III or IV symptoms (35.3 % vs 35.5 %; p = 0.990), or LVEF (41.2 ± 17.1 vs 49.1 ± 13.2; p = 0.074) at the time of CA diagnosis. Black ATTRwt-CA patients demonstrated higher rates of mortality on both univariate (HR: 5.52; CI 2.05-14.81; p = 0.001) and multivariate (HR: 4.85; CI 1.53-15.41; p = 0.007) Cox regression analysis. Black patients with ATTRwt-CA demonstrate phenotypic differences and worse survival compared to non-Black patients.

40374426,Advances in the treatment of cystic fibrosis: CFTR modulators.,,Anales de pediatria,10.1016/j.anpede.2025.503857,"Cystic fibrosis is a severe genetic disease caused by variants in the CFTR gene. Although it is a multisystem disease, respiratory involvement is the main cause of morbidity and mortality. Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator modulator (CFTRm) therapies have advanced the treatment of this disease by improving function of this protein. Ivacaftor, the first CFTRm, has been found to significantly improve lung function and quality of life in patients with certain gating variants. However, only a small percentage of patients in Spain are eligible for this treatment. Combinations of correctors and potentiators, such as lumacaftor-ivacaftor or tezacaftor-ivacaftor, have been developed for treatment of patients with the most frequent variant (F508del), although with limited benefits. Triple therapy with elexacaftor-tezacaftor-ivacaftor has been found to significantly improve respiratory, gastrointestinal and nutritional outcomes as well as quality of life, thus changing the management of CF in eligible patients. The impact of triple therapy is also reflected in an increase in life expectancy and a decrease in mortality and lung transplantation. As regards hepatic and pancreatic involvement, while CFTR modulators have exhibited promising effects, further research is required. The use of CFTR modulators has also shifted nutritional status trends in patients with CF, reducing the risk of undernutrition but increasing the risk of obesity. The use of these drugs for treatment of less frequent variants and for potential antenatal treatment is currently being investigated. Despite these advances, there is still a subset of patients who are ineligible for treatment with modulators or highly effective therapy.",,,mariadolores.pastorvivero@osakidetza.eus.

TCM diagnosis, underpinned by unique theoretical frameworks and methodologies, continues to play a significant role in contemporary healthcare. The four fundamental diagnostic methods, inspection, auscultation-olfaction, inquiry and palpation, are inherently subjective, relying on practitioner experience. Despite its unique advantages and practical value, TCM must still take advantage of modern advancements to enhance its effectiveness and accessibility. With the rapid development of computer technology, intelligent TCM diagnosis has emerged as a promising frontier. Integrating artificial intelligence (AI), particularly through large language models (LLMs), offers new avenues for enhancing TCM diagnostic practices. However, the systematic review and analysis of these technologies remains limited. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of the development and recent advancements in TCM diagnostic technologies, focusing on the applications of ML across various data modalities, and including images, text, and waveforms. Additionally, it explores the latest applications of LLMs within the TCM diagnostic field. Furthermore, the review discusses the prospects and challenges associated with AI-based TCM diagnosis. By systematically summarizing the latest research achievements and technological advancements, this study aims to provide directional guidance and decision support for future research and practical applications in the intersection of AI and TCM. Ultimately, this review seeks to foster the continued development and integration of intelligent TCM diagnosis into modern healthcare.",,,

This was further highlighted during the COVID-19 pandemic when hospitals worldwide were overwhelmed by infected patients requiring acute hospital care. To address these challenges, a hospital-at-home (HaH) programme offers an alternative to conventional in-hospital admission. Furthermore, HaH has the potential to improve patient outcomes, reduce costs and increase patient satisfaction. However, few studies have evaluated HaH in a Scandinavian setting, and this article describes the protocol for a randomised controlled trial (RCT) comparing an HaH model with continued conventional in-hospital admission. The main aim of the trial is to evaluate physical activity level and mental wellbeing in patients admitted at home compared with conventionally admitted patients. 110 clinically stable patients from two internal medical wards at Nordsjaellands Hospital in Denmark will be included and randomised in a ratio of 1:1 to either continued conventional in-hospital admission (control group) or virtual HaH model (intervention group). The control group will receive standard hospital treatment, and the intervention group will be transferred home for continued treatment (eg, intravenous antibiotics or oxygen treatment). The primary outcome measures are physical activity assessed using daily step count (during the first 24 hours after inclusion, as an intermediary indicator of the risk of adverse events) and treatment satisfaction (assessed using a patient satisfaction survey). Secondary outcome measures are adverse events of special interest, escalation of care, readmission rate postdischarge (30 days and 90 days), mortality (associated and 7 days, 30 days and 90 days postdischarge), process data (eg, the number of teleconsultations) and a health economic evaluation. The study was approved by the Danish Research Ethics Committees (no. 2303051) and the Danish Medicines Agency (CIV-23-03-042542) and will be monitored by the Copenhagen University Hospital Good Clinical Practice unit. Results will be published in peer-reviewed journals and presented at relevant national and international conferences.

This practice may increase the risk of out-of-specification (OOS) medicines being dispensed, potentially contributing to treatment failure and antibiotic resistance. To address this concern, we assessed the quality of antibiotics purchased without a prescription at private drug retail outlets (PDROs) in Indonesia. We conducted a cross-sectional study in Tabalong and Bekasi, Indonesia, using standardised patients (SPs) who purchased antibiotics without a prescription for three clinical scenarios: upper respiratory tract infection (URTI), tuberculosis (TB) and child diarrhoea. The pharmacies and drug stores were randomly selected from each subdistrict based on the probability proportional method. We measured the active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) content of the antibiotic samples using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The quality of 183 antibiotics including amoxicillin tablets (148/183, 80.9%, 95% CI 74.7% to 86.1%), amoxicillin dry syrup (12/183, 6.6%, 95% CI 3.6% to 10.8%), ampicillin tablets (5/183, 2.7%, 95% CI 1.1% to 5.9%) and ciprofloxacin tablets (18/183, 9.8%, 95% CI 6.2% to 14.8%) obtained from 117/166 (70.5%, 95% CI 62.8 to 77.2) PDROs were tested. Descriptive statistics were used to describe the characteristics of the purchased antibiotics, and the API content of each antibiotic was compared against the United States Pharmacopeia 43-National Formulary 38 (USP 43-NF 38) standards in absolute values and percentages. Almost all samples produced in Indonesia (182/183, 99.5%, 95% CI 97.5% to 99.9%) were unbranded (123/183, 67.2%, 95% CI 60.2% to 73.7%) or branded generic (60/183, 32.8%, 95% CI 26.3% to 39.8%) and packaged in strips (165/183, 90.2%, 95% CI 85.2% to 93.8%). Around 12/183 (6.6%, 95% CI 3.6% to 10.8%) antibiotics were found to be OOS; these were mostly amoxicillin 125 mg dry syrup (6/12, 50%, 95% CI 24.3% to 75.7%) and ciprofloxacin 500 mg tablet (5/18, 27.8%, 95% CI 11.5% to 50.6%). Around 33% (4/12, 95% CI 12.5% to 61.2%) of amoxicillin 125 mg dry syrup samples had an API content above the label claim, the highest being 187%, whereas 16.7% (2/12, 95% CI 3.6% to 43.6%) were below the label claim, the lowest being 64%. About 27.8% (5/18, 95% CI 11.5% to 50.6%) of ciprofloxacin samples tested had an API content above the label claim; the highest was 120%.

We compared the two recommended diagnostic processes using a Chinese population-based health economics analysis. Our analysis considered a hypothetical cohort of patients with typical reflux symptoms. We constructed a decision tree model to compare the two recommended diagnostic processes described in ACG clinical guidelines (stratified endoscopy strategy) and Chinese expert consensus (endoscopy-first strategy). The first strategy begins with hazard stratification based on alarm symptoms. Patients with alarm symptoms directly undergo endoscopic examination, while patients without alarm symptoms receive proton pump inhibitors as diagnostic treatment. In the second strategy, all patients with reflux symptoms complete an endoscopic examination. Sensitivity analysis was performed to evaluate a range of cost and probability estimates on costs and health outcomes over a 1-year time horizon from the healthcare system perspective. The total expected costs were US$122.51 for the stratified endoscopy strategy and US$150.12 for the endoscopy-first strategy. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) comparing the endoscopy-first strategy with the stratified endoscopy strategy was US$440.39 per additional correct case of GERD. The rates of detecting upper gastrointestinal carcinoma of the two strategies were 0.0088 and 0.0120, and the ICER was US$8561.34. The use of endoscopy for all patients with reflux symptoms was more effective but with an increased cost compared with the strategy recommended in international guidelines.",,,wudong@pumch.cn.

CPGs primarily aid healthcare practitioners but are also used by patients, policymakers, and organizations. The study aim was to assess CPG quality using the AGREE II instrument and to identify AGREE II items and domains that influence the overall assessment. Medline and eight CPG databases were searched for guidelines applicable to older patients (≥60 years, frail, or with dementia/delirium) in acute orthopedic/traumatological settings, published in English or German since January 1st, 2016, and employing an evidence appraisal. Titles, abstracts, and full texts were independently screened by two reviewers using Covidence. AGREE II assessments were conducted across all 23 items in six domains by three reviewers with different professional backgrounds. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, Mann-Whitney U test, Pearson's r correlation matrix, variance inflation factor (VIF), univariable and multivariable regression (non-negative least squares), and intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). Significance was set at p<0.05. A total of 120 CPGs have been appraised, reaching a mean overall rating of 4.35 (±1.13). Most guidelines received an overall rating of five (n=40, 33.33%), one guideline received an overall rating of one (0.8%). Using a standardized evidence rating framework (e.g. GRADE) is significantly associated with a better overall rating (p<0.001). The multivariable analysis showed that items 9, 12, and 15 had the highest influence on the overall AGREE II rating. Domain 6 (editorial independence) did not have an influence on the overall rating in a multivariable analysis. Methodological rigor, particularly the use of a standardized evidence rating framework, is essential for a good overall AGREE II rating and thus for high-quality CPGs. The results from this analysis can assist different stakeholders who also conduct AGREE II appraisals, develop CPGs, or are charged with implementing CPG recommendations.",,,

SARS-CoV-2 nonstructural proteins (NSPs) are essential for impeding the host replication mechanism while also assisting in the production and organization of new viral components. However, NSPs are not incorporated into viral particles, and their subsequent fate within host cells remains poorly understood. Additionally, their role in viral pathogenesis requires further investigation. This study aimed to discover the ultimate fate of NSP6 in host cells and to elucidate its role in viral pathogenesis. We investigated the effects of NSP6 on cell death and explored the underlying mechanism; moreover, we examined the degradation mechanism of NSP6 in human cells, along with analysing its correlation with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) severity in patient peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). NSP6 was demonstrated to induce cell death. Specifically, NSP6 interacted with EI24 autophagy-associated transmembrane protein (EI24) to increase intracellular Ca This study reveals that KLHL22-mediated ubiquitination controls NSP6 stability and that NSP6 induces autophagic cell death via calcium overload, highlighting its cytotoxic role and suggesting therapeutic strategies that target calcium signaling or promote NSP6 degradation as potential interventions against COVID-19.",,,ly13767160474@sina.com.

Diabetes & endocrinology,10.1016/S2213-8587(25)00062-2,"Adrenal incidentalomas are found in 3-10% of adults undergoing abdominal imaging. Of these, 30-50% are responsible for mild autonomous cortisol secretion (MACS), which is frequently associated with hypertension. The impact of adrenalectomy on hypertension in patients with unilateral incidentalomas and MACS remains uncertain. The aim of the CHIRACIC study was to prospectively assess the impact of surgical excision of the incidentaloma on blood pressure with a randomised trial combining accurate blood pressure measurement and standardisation of antihypertensive treatment. CHIRACIC was a multicentre, superiority, open-label, parallel, randomised controlled trial performed at 17 university hospitals in France, Italy, and Germany. Adults with hypertension with MACS entered a run-in phase to confirm hypertension with multiple home blood pressure measurements (HBPM) before blood pressure was normalised with standardised stepped-care antihypertensive treatment. Eligible participants were then randomly assigned (1:1) to adrenalectomy or conservative management. Randomisation was blocked (random block size of 4 and 6) and stratified by intensity of antihypertensive treatment. Participants were followed up for 13 months and systematic attempts were made to gradually reduce antihypertensive treatment. The primary endpoint was the proportion of normotensive participants using HBPM who reduced their antihypertensive treatment in the intention-to-treat population at study completion. Key secondary endpoints included 24 h ambulatory blood pressure measurement (ABPM), mean change in antihypertensive treatment, and the proportion of participants with antihypertensive treatment at study completion. This study was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02364089, and is completed. Between April 9, 2015 and Nov 23, 2022, 78 patients were enrolled, and 52 eligible participants were randomly assigned to adrenalectomy (n=26, 23 underwent adrenalectomy and completed the study) or conservative management (n=26, 25 completed the study). The median age of participants was 63·3 years (IQR 57·4-68·2) and 36 (69%) were female. At study completion, a reduction in antihypertensive treatment with normal HBPM was observed in 12 (46%) of 26 participants treated with adrenalectomy and in four (15%) of 26 treated conservatively (adjusted risk difference [RD] 0·34 [95% CI 0·11 to 0·58]; p=0·0038). Similar results of smaller magnitude were observed for systolic blood pressure during 24 h ABPM. There were ten (43%) of 23 participants still needing antihypertensive treatment in the adrenalectomy group and 24 (96%) of 25 in the conservative management group (adjusted RD -0·58 [95% CI -0·78 to -0·38]; p<0·0001). Mean antihypertensive treatment step was 0·8 (SD 1·1) in the adrenalectomy group and 3·0 (1·4) in the conservative management groups (adjusted difference -2·05 [95% CI -2·61 to -1·50]; p<0·0001]. The number of patients with normal systolic HBPM and no hypertensive treatment was 12 (52%) of 23 in the adrenalectomy group and none in the conservative management group. Serious adverse events occurred in eight (35%) of 23 participants in the adrenalectomy group and eight (31%) of 26 participants in the conservative management group. Three serious adverse events for three (13%) participants were related to the surgery (post-surgical wall pain and hypotension).

This complexity makes traditional research protocols challenging, leading to the exclusion of older individuals in clinical trials (CTs) and limiting the applicability of evidence-based medicine, especially in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). A scoping review of the literature (based on PubMed, Embase, and Scopus) was conducted to identify recommendations to improve the methodology of CTs involving older persons. The findings were then shared with a panel of researchers with expertise in older adult research in LMICs, who assessed and refined the recommendations for implementation in low-resource settings. After screening more than 4,700 articles, 80 were retained as relevant, providing 1,119 inputs on the design and conduct of CTs in older persons. These inputs were homogenised into 120 recommendations and organised into 13 clusters representing different phases and aspects of a CT. Key recommendations, enriched from experts' input, indicate the importance of addressing various barriers that hinder older persons' participation in CTs in LMICs, such as poor funding, inadequate age-friendly facilities, ageism, transportation issues, and the need for standardised terminology and culturally sensitive assessment tools.

A qualitative exploratory descriptive study. The study was conducted in a quaternary paediatric intensive care unit in Queensland, Australia. Focus groups (n = 4) were conducted with nurses (n = 32) caring for children requiring mechanical ventilation and sedation. The Capability, Opportunity and Motivation model of Behaviour change (COM-B) provided the conceptual framework for this study. Qualitative data were thematically analysed. Nurse reported challenges in balancing sedation needs with patient safety. Knowledge and experience with sedation management in mechanically ventilated children, and continuity of care, positively influenced light sedation. Resources in both the physical and social environment, including family engagement, play a positive role in enhancing the practice of light sedation. Light sedation in the younger paediatric population, and those with delirium, was identified as challenging. Nonpharmacological measures facilitated management of lightly sedated patients whereas inconsistent practice among physicians and lack of nursing autonomy were identified as barriers. The practice of light sedation is most effectively promoted when it is prioritized at the organisational level. Ensuring adequate human resources, modifying the physical environment, and fostering collaboration among multidisciplinary teams, including family, are all likely to enhance its implementation. Nurses' knowledge and experience in sedation management, alongside continuity of care and utilising nonpharmacological interventions, can further promote its practice. However, factors such as nurses' concerns for their own professional and patient safety, high acuity levels in the unit, and a lack of support may hinder the adoption of light sedation practices. The findings from this study suggest engaging multidisciplinary team to support light sedation practice. Likewise, training and skill development of nurses in the assessment and management of sedation may help implement light sedation. Continuity of care, adequate staffing, patient visibility and minimising stimulation should be considered to support the same. Nurses need to be empowered to practice light sedation, and sedation protocols may be helpful in this regard.",,,abdul.qayum@health.qld.gov.au.

We evaluated clinical outcomes of cannabis abuse across ten disorders: cluster headache, neuropathy, multiple sclerosis, stroke, transient ischemic attack (TIA), Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, vascular dementia, migraine, and tension-type headache. Using data from the TriNetX global federated health research network (143 healthcare organizations), we identified patients with and without cannabis abuse for each disorder. Propensity score matching balanced demographic and clinical characteristics. Patients were followed for up to three years post-index event, and outcomes were compared by assessing emergency department (ED) visits, pain prevalence, mortality, and cerebrovascular events using risk ratios. Cannabis abuse was consistently linked to significantly higher ED utilization and pain prevalence across all conditions. For example, neuropathy patients with cannabis abuse experienced 25.8 % ED visits compared to 19.3 % in non-users. Although trends toward increased mortality and recurrent stroke/TIA were noted, these differences were generally not statistically significant. Our findings demonstrate a differential impact of cannabis abuse across neurological disorders, markedly elevating acute care needs and pain burden. These results highlight the need for tailored management and additional research.",Meyer EC,Department for Internal Medicine,younesadam.tabi@uksh.de.
40373214,Experiences and Needs of Core Participants in Surgical Ward Rounds: Qualitative Exploratory Study.,,Journal of participatory medicine,10.2196/69578,"Surgical ward rounds (SWRs) are typically led by doctors, with limited involvement from key participants, including patients, family members, and bedside nurses. Despite the potential benefits of a more collaborative and person-centered approach, efforts to engage these stakeholders remain rare. This qualitative exploratory study aims to examine the experiences and needs of doctors, nurses, patients, and their relatives during SWRs as part of a participatory design process. Data were collected through ethnographic field studies, focus groups with the health care providers, patients, and relatives, and dyadic interviews conducted as part of home visits to patients and their partners after discharge. Field notes and interview data were analyzed using systematic text condensation. Lack of organization, traditional roles, and cultural norms compromised the quality, efficiency, and user experience of SWRs in multiple ways. SWRs were routine-driven, treatment-focused, and received lower priority than surgical tasks. Unpredictability resulted in unprepared participants and limited access for nurses, patients, and relatives to partake. The study identified a gap between the organizational and cultural frameworks governing the SWRs and the experiences and needs of key participants. Digital technologies were perceived as a potential solution to address some of these challenges.",,,

Mutations in the RAS-MAPK pathway are implicated in both conditions, suggesting a shared genetic basis; however, only one prior case has demonstrated a clonal relationship. We report a 21-month-old boy with a progressive yellow papulonodular rash, dusky plaques, and recurrent infections. Skin biopsy confirmed JXG, and exome sequencing revealed a somatic PTPN11 (c.226 G>A) variant in both peripheral blood (32.6%) and skin lesion (27.2%). The early identification of this mutation prompted urgent hemato-oncologic evaluation. Two weeks later, the patient developed overt JMML and was successfully treated with chemotherapy and bone marrow transplantation. The shared mutation supports a clonal relationship between JXG and JMML. This case highlights the value of early genetic testing in atypical JXG and represents the second documented case of clonally related, sequential JXG and JMML.",,,
40373191,The State of Interprofessional Supervision in Practice: A Qualitative Analysis.,,Social work,10.1093/sw/swaf018,"Clinical supervision is a professional expectation across social work and other behavioral health disciplines, but the academic literature on supervision has historically been professionally insular, and little research has been conducted in the United States on interprofessional supervision (IPS), or supervision across disciplines. Therefore, authors sought to understand the lived experiences of supervision for behavioral health clinicians from various behavioral health professions in practice settings where multiple professions were present. This qualitative study analyzed data from 20 interviews of clinicians practicing in diverse mental health and/or substance disorder treatment settings. Four main themes emerged: (1) value of IPS, (2) clinical supervision in peer supervision spaces, (3) varied individual supervision experiences, and (4) role of organizational culture in supervision. Results suggest implications for the profession of social work, including the opportunity for the profession to better define its disciplinary competencies and indicate how those competencies are of value in supervision, as well as to prioritize training and research in uniprofessional and interprofessional supervision.",,,

This study aims to evaluate the applicability of risk-based screening approaches in the Indonesian demographic through a case-control study involving 305 women. We developed a personalized breast cancer risk assessment workflow that integrates multiple risk factors, including clinical (Gail) and polygenic (Mavaddat) risk predictions, into a consolidated risk category. By evaluating the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of each single-factor risk model, we demonstrated that they retained their predictive accuracy in the Indonesian context (AUC for clinical risk: 0.67 [0.61,0.74]; AUC for genetic risk: 0.67 [0.61,0.73]). Notably, our combined risk approach enhanced the AUC to 0.70 [0.64,0.76], highlighting the advantages of a multifaceted model. Our findings demonstrate for the first time the applicability of the Mavaddat and Gail models to Indonesian populations, and show that within this demographic, combined risk models provide a superior predictive framework compared to single-factor approaches.",Rabbani B; Tanu SG; Ramanto KN; Audrienna J; Fernandez EA; Aldila F; Gonzalez-Porta M; Valeska MD; Haruman J; Ulag LH; Maulana Y; Junusmin KI; Amelia M; Gabriella G; Soetyono F; Fajarrahman A; Hasan SSM; Sani L; Irwanto A,PT Nalagenetik Riset Indonesia; Nalagenetics Pte Ltd,

While extensive research has focused on CAD management in patients awaiting liver transplantation, data on the outcomes of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in the post-transplant population remain limited. This retrospective cohort study used the National Inpatient Sample database (2016-2021) to evaluate PCI hospitalizations involving LTR and non-transplant patients. Propensity score matching (1:3) was applied to balance the covariates between the LTRs and non-transplant patients. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. Among the 2 681 545 PCI hospitalizations, LTRs accounted for 0.1% (n = 2675). LTRs were more likely to have diabetes (60.56% vs. 41.36%) and chronic kidney disease (60.93% vs. 21.06%) but less likely to have hyperlipidemia (58.32% vs. 72.65%; all p < 0.001). The crude rates of AKI (32.34% vs. 16.07%; p < 0.001) and blood transfusion (5.61% vs. 2.76%; p = 0.0001) were higher in the LTRs. After matching, the LTRs were associated with lower odds of in-hospital mortality (OR, 0.55; 95% CI, 0.30-1.00; p = 0.05) and cardiogenic shock (OR, 0.46; 95% CI, 0.29-0.74; p = 0.001). PCI hospitalizations among LTRs increased over time, peaking in 2019 (116.6/100 000). Despite higher comorbidities and complication rates, LTRs undergoing PCI exhibited lower in-hospital mortality than non-transplant patients, likely reflecting survivor bias, rigorous pre- and post-transplant care, and specialized management. These preliminary findings highlight the need for further studies with detailed clinical data to validate the current findings.",Krittanawong C,HumanX,
40372829,In Defense of a Policy Based Approach to Health.,2025-05-15,"Families, systems & health : the journal of collaborative family healthcare",10.1037/fsh0000978,"Health policy plays a critical role in shaping individual and population health outcomes through mechanisms that extend beyond clinical care and into the broader social and structural determinants of health. This commentary examines the definition, scope, and significance of health policy, emphasizing its presence across multiple levels of governance, including federal, state, and local jurisdictions, as well as within health systems themselves. Drawing on established frameworks such as Kingdon's Policy Streams Model and Frieden's Health Impact Pyramid, the article argues that upstream policy interventions have the greatest potential for population-level impact. However, a persistent gap exists between research findings and policy implementation, particularly within academic medicine and health care delivery systems. Clinicians and health services researchers are uniquely positioned to inform and influence policy, yet are often underutilized in this space. The commentary highlights the importance of equipping health care professionals with the tools to translate clinical insights and research findings into actionable policy recommendations. It also underscores the ethical imperative of inclusive, evidence-based policy development, as articulated by Faden and Shebaya, who note that policy reflects a society's values and priorities. Ultimately, the article calls for a more intentional integration of clinical expertise and policy engagement, encouraging health professionals to leverage their real-world experience to advance equitable and effective health policies. Strengthening the bridge between health care delivery and health policy is essential for addressing persistent public health challenges and achieving long-term improvements in population health.

40372757,Pediatric Intensive Care Unit Conflict Management Perspectives Among Physician and Nurse Leaders.,2025-05-15,JAMA network open,10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2025.9783,"Decision-making conflict is common in the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) and associated with negative outcomes for patients, families, and teams. Disparities in conflict outcomes are reported, yet no studies have explored conflict management approaches. To understand approaches to conflict mediation and escalation in the PICU. This national, multicenter, prospective, mixed-methods survey study recruited PICU physician and nursing directors from February to April 2023. PICU size, conflict policy, behavior contract tracking. Closed- and open-ended survey questions were used to collect information on hospital policies, general conflict approaches, and specific approaches to scenarios. The overall response rate was 57% (68 of 120 surveys, with 60 complete enough for analysis). Overall, 30 of 51 respondents (59%) identified as female, with a wide distribution of reported years in current role and percentage of time spent in clinical care. Institution regions varied, with an even distribution among institutions with different PICU sizes. Conflict strategies were used variably across institutions. Approximately 65% (32 of 49) reported policies for conflict management. Only 23% (10 of 43) tracked conflicts and their outcomes. Few institutions trained staff in conflict management techniques. Compared with institutions that did not track behavior contracts, those that did were more likely to call ethics consults for conflict management (3 of 12 [25%] vs 0 of 20; P = .04) and to implement behavior contracts for more objective reasons (8 of 11 [73%] vs 4 of 16 [25%]; P = .02). Leaders offered ideas for multipronged conflict prevention and response based on strategies implemented at their institutions but also highlighted needs and concerns with existing approaches. In this mixed-methods survey study of PICU physician and nurse leaders, tracking and internal reporting of conflicts and outcomes were associated with more objectively applied interventions. The wide-ranging approaches and thresholds for escalation voiced by our respondents indicate a need to develop standardized and evidence-based processes to ensure greater effectiveness by clinical teams and leaders in addressing conflict and reduce potential disparities in outcomes. Respondents shared ideas for preventive and responsive processes that could be implemented and tested in the future. Learning from existing management approaches may help develop standardized, generalizable interventions to reduce conflict, improve interventions, and reduce subjectivity in the application of interventions.",,,

An emerging literature describes factors associated with disparities between Spanish and English speakers with the use of digital health tools and documents. To characterize barriers and facilitators and to inform hypothesis-generating questions and intervention planning associated with digital health technology use among Spanish-speaking populations in the US. Between January 2023 and April 2024, PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Google Scholar were searched for publications between January 2013 and April 2024. Systematic reviews, protocols, editorials, abstracts, unpublished literature, non-peer-reviewed literature, and non-US-based and non-English studies were excluded. The Covidence platform was used to avoid duplicate records, and an abstract and full-text screening were then conducted for exclusions. Unstructured text in the final dataset was thematically analyzed. Of 688 publications searched, 192 were excluded as duplications, 277 were excluded from abstract screenings, and 113 were excluded from full-text screenings. Among the 106 included studies (68% of which were published between 2019 and 2024), 73 (69%) used quantitative methods, 15 (14%) used qualitative methods, and 18 (17%) used applied mixed methods. The primary technologies studied were characterized as portal (21% [n = 22]), telehealth (42% [n = 45]), mobile health (16% [n = 17]), web-based resources (9% [n = 10]), and mixed (studies reporting >1 technology; 11% [n = 12]). Compared with English speakers, studies revealed consistently lower portal account activation, portal use, telehealth adoption, and online resource use among Spanish speakers. Barriers to use across all technologies included limited access to technology and Wi-Fi, low literacy, and limited digital literacy. Barriers to portal and telehealth use included lack of awareness of digital tools, limited patient-facing instructions in Spanish, and interpreter-related challenges. Facilitators cited across multiple technologies included use of text messaging and social media interventions, interventions involving care partners and/or interpreters, and culturally and linguistically tailored Spanish materials. The results of this scoping review suggest that Spanish-speaking persons in the US faced technology, language, and literacy-related barriers to digital technology use. Embracing support for care partners, facilitating text message or social media-oriented workflows, and ensuring that materials are linguistically and culturally tailored represent approaches for health systems, electronic health record vendors, and community health organizations to mitigate these disparities.",,,

We report a case of a 73-year-old Japanese male with sporadic, gastric-localized JPS harboring a SMAD4 mosaic variant who presented with slowly progressive endoscopic lesions. Endoscopy at the age of 55 revealed erythematous and edematous mucosa in the gastric fundus. During the following 18 years, the patient developed progressive gastric polyposis, leading to refractory anemia and hypoalbuminemia. Genetic testing identified a SMAD4 frameshift mosaic variant (c.1245_1248del (p.Asp415Glufs)) with an allele frequency of 23%.

This unpredictability makes effective patient-healthcare professional (HCP) dialogue essential for optimal diagnosis and management, with communication as a key component of shared decision-making (SDM). We designed a needs assessment to understand the differences between HCP and patient communication needs and perspectives on the impact of MG. A mixed-methods approach was utilized, comprising a survey and semi-structured interviews with HCPs and patients with MG. Quantitative data from the survey were extracted and analyzed to understand trends of knowledge, skills, and attitudes toward patient-HCP dialogue and SDM in MG. Interviews were transcribed and analyzed using principles of thematic analysis to identify perspectives on the impact of MG and challenges in communication. Completed survey data were collected from 47 HCPs and 122 patients. There were discrepancies and areas of alignment in the priorities each group placed on knowledge, skills, and attitudes in MG management. Patients valued HCPs' listening skills and knowledge of treatment history, whereas HCPs prioritized knowing what matters to a patient with MG, including providing support to the patient and their family/carer. Both groups agreed on the necessity of a compassionate and informed approach to care. Interviews (10 HCPs; 10 patients) revealed key themes, including the multifaceted way in which symptoms impact patients' lives and challenges patients face while communicating their experiences. This needs assessment indicated general alignment between patients and HCPs on MG symptoms; however, notable disparities were found in relation to the perceived impact of these symptoms on patients' lives, and communication. While some HCPs expected patients to volunteer information on symptoms and MG-related challenges, patients expected their HCPs to ask. This highlights a need for improved communication strategies, which will foster SDM approaches.",Reyes Acosta C; Rodriguez A; Foss A; Lehnerer S; De Backer M; Monin N; Barry S; Weisshardt I,UCB; Myasthenia Gravis Association (MGA); LLH Concepts GbR; Department of Neurology with Experimental Neurology,reyes.cornelia@gmail.com.

This retrospective multicenter study included 75 patients with stage 3 CRC. The patients were classified into high-LODDS (LODDS-H, n = 32) and low-LODDS (LODDS-L, n = 43) groups. Significant differences were found in the 5-year relapse-free survival (RFS) rates (LODDS-H: 34.0% vs. LODDS-L: 53.1%; p = 0.041) and overall survival (OS) rates (52.4% vs. 68.3%; p = 0.012). A multivariate analysis revealed that blood loss [hazard ratio (HR) 2.266, 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.142-4.494; p = 0.019] was an independent predictor of the RFS. Age ≥ 75 years old (HR 2.769, 95% CI 1.206-6.360; p = 0.016), blood loss (HR 3.552, 95% CI 1.460-8.643; p = 0.005), adjuvant chemotherapy (HR 0.415, 95% CI 0.177-0.972; p = 0.043), and LODDS (HR 3.593, 95% CI 1.511-8.544; p = 0.004) were independent predictors of OS.

Phytotherapy harnesses the therapeutic effects of plants and their components (phytopharmaceuticals). According to the World Health Organization (WHO), phytotherapy remains a crucial pillar of healthcare today and is expected to become even more important in the future. Referring to our initial review article from 2011, we now present an update to cover the period from 2011 to the present. Which phytopharmaceuticals are relevant in otorhinolaryngology, and is there evidence-based data supporting their use? A literature search was conducted for the period from 2011 to 2024 using PubMed (MEDLINE). The search results were further refined by focusing on randomized, clinical, and controlled trials written in English and adhering to Good Clinical Practice (GCP) guidelines. The search term ""phytotherapy"" yielded 44,202 results. After limiting to 2011-2024 and applying the aforementioned criteria, 1685 results remained. With respect to otorhinolaryngology, only six studies remained. This procedure was applied to all search terms and otorhinolaryngology-specific search terms. Exclusion criteria included homeopathy, shamanistic medicine, case reports, studies not conducted according to GCP guidelines, and studies not written in English. The search term ""traditional medicine"" returned 275,079 results. After limiting to 2011-2024 and applying the aforementioned criteria, 6448 results remained.

After limiting to 2011-2024 and applying the criteria, 7815 results remained. With respect to otorhinolaryngology, only one study remained. In total, 14 studies were selected and presented. Since 2011, a substantial number of new studies on phytotherapy have been published. However, few studies utilize standardized measurement methods and materials, thus precluding objective statements. Such standardization is essential for practical therapeutic application. Due to the frequently inadequate adherence to GCP guidelines, there has been no significant gain in knowledge regarding the effects and efficacy of phytopharmaceuticals. Intensive clinical research is still required to adequately utilize phytotherapy.

Typical imaging shows bilateral parieto-occipital involvement, though rare cases affect deep brain structures. It is known that despite its definition, PRES includes a broad spectrum of radiological pictures, even if parietooccipital location remains the most common. This study explored possible clinical characteristics and risk factors correlating with different radiological phenotypes, hypothesizing a consequent different pathogenesis. A retrospective analysis of 50 PRES patients (2010-2023) assessed demographics, clinical features, comorbidities, imaging findings, and outcomes. MRI scans were evaluated for lesion location, symmetry, hemispheric or deep (atypical), and infratentorial distribution. Severe hypertension correlated with deep brain involvement (26%) compared to typical supratentorial forms (0.5%, p = 0.0500). Surgical patients were less likely to have deep region involvement (0.6% vs. 60%, p < 0.0001). Seizures were more common in typical PRES (90%) versus deep variants (66%, p = 0.0500). Autoimmune diseases were associated with hemorrhage [OR 8.5, p = 0.0153] and DWI restriction [OR 8.05, p = 0.0149]. A significant link was also found between DWI restriction and severe arterial hypertension [OR 6.66 (CI 95% 1.37-32.29), p = 0.0184]. DWI restriction and hemorrhage were linked to brain sequelae [OR 21 and OR 20.55, respectively, p = 0.0013-0.0014]. Our study confirms a link between different brain regions involved in PRES and various risk factors, focusing on deep structures (atypical form) versus supratentorial involvement. It highlights correlations between imaging features (such as DWI restriction and hemorrhage) and brain sequelae at follow-up, emphasizing the multifaceted nature of PRES and the potential to identify patient subgroups with distinct pathophysiological mechanisms and varying risks of brain injury sequelae.",Del Poggio A; Mapelli R; Falini A; Anzalone N,IRCCS Ospedale San Raffaele,delpoggio.anna@hsr.it.

Strong evidence implicates complement dysregulation in the pathogenesis of secondary TMA, and emerging data increasingly suggest that pharmacological blockade of the complement improves the outcomes in patients with secondary TMA. Certain forms of secondary TMA, including postpartum TMA, TMA with coexisting hypertensive emergency and de novo TMA after kidney transplantation exhibit a high prevalence of pathogenic variants in complement genes, similar to those observed in primary atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome. These conditions should be considered as complement-mediated TMA triggered by pregnancy or transplantation, or in which severe hypertension represents a symptom rather than the etiology of TMA. Their optimal management relies on early initiation of complement inhibition. Other etiologies of secondary TMA (i.e. autoimmune diseases, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, drugs, infections) are typically not linked with complement gene variants and their management primarily focuses on removal of the culprit trigger or treatment of the underlying condition. While well-designed trials are still awaited, a growing body of evidence suggests that complement activation is also involved in the pathopathophysiology of these diseases. Complement inhibitors, which have been associated with better outcomes, should be considered in patients with severe (life- or organ-threatening TMA) or refractory secondary TMA despite adequate management of the underlying condition. This review summarizes the current understanding and future directions in the management of secondary TMA, emphasizing the potential of complement inhibition as therapeutic strategy.",Aydin S,Department of Pathology,

Demographic factors, health indicators, and the Meuhedet Electronic Frailty Index containing 36 deficits. Worsening frailty is defined as a higher frailty level one year later in 2024 compared to 2023. A new frailty deficit is defined as a deficit appearing in 2024 that was not present in 2023. The comparison of worsening percentages by demographic and clinical characteristics was tested using the chi-square test at the univariable level and logistic regression at the multivariable level. Overall, 13.3% of participants worsened after one year of follow-up, with 2.3% dying.

Yet, studies on spatial and temporal distribution of tyhoid fever are lacking. This study was conducted to analyze retrospective hospital-based data at the village level over the period 2017-2023 to understand the spatial and temporal variation of typhoid fever in Jakarta. Spatial analyses were performed by Moran's I and Local Indicators of Spatial Association (LISA) to examine spatial clustering of typhoid incidence and to identify high-risk villages for typhoid fever, respectively. Seasonal decomposition analysis was performed to investigate the seasonality of this infection. A total of 57,468 typhoid cases, resulting in a cumulative incidence of 533.99 per 100,000 people, were reported during the study period. The incidence was significantly clustered (I=0.548; p=0.001) at the village level across Jakarta. Statistically significant high-risk clusters were detected in the South and East of Jakarta that were heterogeneous over time. We identified seven persistent high-risk clusters in the eastern part of the city and two in the southern part. Moreover, the typhoid incidence showed a strong seasonality trend, significantly associated with monthly total rainfall (p=0.018). The study revealed a significant spatial variation with strong seasonality in typhoid incidence across the city suggesting a variation in transmission intensity and needs for effective public health interventions, especially in the high-risk areas. Improvement in water and sanitation facilities, hygiene awareness and surveillance are essential to help reduce typhoid transmission in Jakarta.",,,

The aim of this work is to develop and validate a digital PCR method for the accurate quantification of HDV RNA, including evaluation of its clinical accuracy, especially for low-concentrated clinical samples. The reverse transcription digital PCR (RT-dPCR) development followed the standard procedure, including primer design, determination of linearity, calculation of recovery and the intermediate precision of the RNA extraction kits, determination of the limit of detection (LOD) and quantification (LOQ), droplet size measurements, conversion factor, and uncertainty budget. The World Health Organisation (WHO)-HDV international standard was used for RT-dPCR development. Commutability of the new method was explored, comparing RT-dPCR with quantification assays applied in clinical routine using clinical plasma samples covering a range of HDV RNA concentrations. The conversion factor from copies/mL to IU/mL was 0.77. LOD and LOQ of the RT-dPCR were 0.7 copies/mL (0.56 IU/mL) and 10 copies/mL (8 IU/mL), respectively. When evaluating the qualitative results of the clinical HDV samples at low concentrations, 31% of the HDV clinical samples tested negative by RT-qPCR were tested positive by RT-dPCR. The RT-qPCR and RT-dPCR quantitative data showed a good correlation with a standard deviation of ±1.12 log IU/mL. RT-dPCR is an accurate method for HDV RNA quantification that may serve as a complement to RT-qPCR, especially when accurate detection is essential for decision making in clinical settings.",Windzio L; Falak S; Beheim-Schwarzbach J; Kummrow A; Valiente E,Department 8.3,

Systematic review. We included qualitative and quantitative studies on nurses in advanced roles caring for people with diagnosed or suspected cognitive impairment and their relatives, assessing outcomes at patient, staff and organisational levels. Nurses' advanced role profiles ranged from nurse-led interventions up to Advanced Practice Nurses. We employed the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool for critical appraisal and conducted a synthesis without meta-analysis using a content analysis approach. MEDLINE, CINAHL, Cochrane Library, ALOIS, Web of Science and LIVIVO up to May 2024, along with forward and backward citation tracking. We included 48 studies that described 39 distinct interventions. The majority of these studies employed a quasi-experimental design. Most interventions involved Advanced Practice Nurses (n = 23) and focused on people at risk of or experiencing delirium (n = 22). Nurses in advanced roles predominantly engaged in tasks related to direct clinical practice, as well as coaching and guidance for patients, relatives and colleagues. Their responsibilities also included leadership, collaboration and consultation on a regular basis. Activities related to research and ethical decision-making were infrequently reported. Many areas of responsibility of nurses in advanced roles align with the needs of hospitalised people with cognitive impairment. Nurses in advanced roles increasingly take on diverse activities across all competence domains of Advanced Practice Nursing, with a focus on coaching and guidance, as well as clinical practice, while leadership, collaboration, research and ethical decision-making become more prominent as their formal training advances. Our comprehensive description of advanced nursing roles in the care of people with cognitive impairment provides a foundation for developing and refining such roles in hospitals.

This study leveraged Twitter data to analyze public perceptions related to genetic testing for dementia. English tweets from January 1, 2010 to April 1, 2023, containing relevant terms, were extracted from Twitter API. A Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) model was used with Named Entity Recognition (NER) to identify individual and organizational users. BERT-based topic modeling was applied to identify the themes for relevant source tweets. Topic coherence was assessed through manual inspection, complemented by the Silhouette Coefficient. Manual thematic analysis, following Braun and Clarke's approach, refined the topics and themes. The analysis of 3045 original/source tweets identified 9 topics (Silhouette Coefficient=0.19), categorized into 3 main themes: (1) opinions on the appropriateness of genetic testing in dementia diagnosis; (2) discussion on the psychosocial impact; (3) discussion on genetic testing's role in Alzheimer's disease treatment and prevention. Theme 1 comprised 90.6% of source tweets, demonstrating prevailing contentions. Tweets in theme 2 were increasingly contributed by organization users over time and included tweets containing misinformation about genetic testing in children. Tweets in theme 3 were increasingly contributed by individual users, possibly suggesting rising public interest in the treatment and prevention of dementia.

40371183,Waves of Endurance: A Pilot Study of Beta Brain Wave Signatures Linked to Immune Adaptation in Transatlantic Rowers.,,Cureus,10.7759/cureus.84059,"Ultra-endurance athletics, such as transoceanic rowing, imposes significant physiological stress, leading to muscle catabolism and alterations in immune function. A case series pilot study from our laboratory suggests that the central nervous system may mirror these changes through a pattern of disproportionately high beta brainwave voltage amplitude activity that promotes vigilance. This study investigates the relationship between quantitative electroencephalographic (qEEG) brainwave patterns and markers of innate immune responses in a group of transatlantic rowers post-competition. Twenty-four transatlantic rowers (18 male, 6 female; mean age 31 ± 11 years) were assessed immediately after completing a transatlantic rowing competition of 30 to 53 days duration. EEG recordings measured voltage amplitudes of slow delta (1-3 Hz), theta (4-7 Hz), alpha (8-12 Hz), and fast beta (13-30 Hz) brainwaves under eyes-open and eyes-closed conditions. Pre- and post-race plasma cortisol, testosterone, leptin, myoglobin, total antioxidant content (TAC), malondialdehyde (MDH), collagen oligomeric matrix protein (COMP), IL-6, bacterial killing activity (BKA), and hemolytic complement activity (HCA) assays were used to assess changes in stress responses and immune functions. Student's paired t-test and Pearson's product-moment coefficient were used to evaluate the significance of pre- versus post-race differences in oxidative stress- and immunologic-related biomarkers, as well as correlations between the post-race qEEG parameters and the pre- versus post-race biomarker differences. The changes in body weight were significantly negatively correlated with the changes in cortisol and COMP (r = -0.40, p < 0.05) and significantly positively correlated with the changes in leptin (r = +0.6, p < 0.01). Voltage amplitudes of fast beta waves, under both eyes-open and eyes-closed conditions, positively correlated with the pre- versus post-race percent change in BKA (r = +0.42, +0.44, p < 0.05) and negatively correlated with the pre- versus post-race percent change in HCA (r = -0.65, -0.66, p < 0.01). These findings support the hypothesis that prolonged intense physical exertion may induce a pattern of intense cerebral cortical activation correlated with immune modulation. The increased fast beta activity positively correlated with enhanced bacterial killing and decreased HCA, suggesting a link between cortical arousal and immune adaptation. These findings underscore the interconnectedness of neurophysiological states and physiological stress responses in ultra-endurance athletes.",,,

This article makes a case for evidence-based adolescent OMSRH service integration in African countries. Integration is expected to align with the principles of sustainable development goals, universal healthcare, and the World Health Organization's calls for adolescent-responsive health services. We present a conceptual framework and propose an implementation science-guided blueprint for the integration of adolescent OMSRH care. The focus on dental clinics for integration can potentially increase access to, and use of oral healthcare while addressing adolescents' mental, sexual and reproductive health needs. OMSRH integration for adolescents in African settings will require intensive engagement of adolescents and other crucial stakeholders. Further exploratory and implementation research is also needed to design and evaluate OMSRH integration models to establish best practices for long-term impact on adolescent health outcomes.",,,

A cross-sectional study was conducted in 2023 before Gaza war, with a census sample of healthcare providers at three major governmental pediatric hospitals: Al-Nasr, Al-Durra, and Al-Rantisi. Data were collected through an interview-based questionnaire, and statistical analysis was performed using SPSS version 26. A total of 336 participants were included (59.5% male, 40.5% female). Of these, 13% were pediatricians, 16% general doctors, 1% pediatric nurses, and 70% were general nurses. The overall total scores for healthcare providers' responses to the eight WHO quality standards was 29.5%; in addition, it was varied across hospitals: Al-Nasr (29.1%), EL-Rantisi (31.9%), and Al-Durra (28.4%). The lowest score was for Standard VIII (8.3%), related to the physical environment, while the highest score was for Standard V (70.9%) related to rights of children. Statistically significant differences were found for standards I, II, IV, VII, and VIII between the hospitals ( The study revealed suboptimal pediatric care quality in Gaza Strip hospitals. The lowest scores for the healthcare providers, was 8.3% for standard (VIII), which pertains to the physical environment, emphasizing the need for infrastructural improvements, while the highest scores 70.9% was for standard (V) shows the providers respectful view and acts for children rights without discrimination. There is a need to prioritize upgrading the physical environment and ensuring the availability of essential resources, such as water, sanitation, and medical supplies, to enhance the overall quality of care for children in these hospitals.

40370921,Depression and Its Predictors in Adults Receiving Antiretroviral Therapy.,,Cureus,10.7759/cureus.82222,"Background and aim Depression is a common psychiatric morbidity seen in adults living with HIV/AIDS. Several contextual factors have been implicated in the pathogenesis of depression in HIV-positive adults, these factors could be clinical, treatment-related, or socio-demographic in nature. Due to the debilitating nature of depression and its adverse effect on antiretroviral treatment adherence, HIV-positive adults living with depression are at risk of sub-optimal treatment response and, consequently, poor health outcomes. This suggests that there is a need for more research on depression and its risk factors in HIV-positive adults, as this could inform the promotion of preventive measures against the disorder, as well as early identification and treatment of affected persons. This study aimed to determine the prevalence and predictors of depression among HIV-positive adults receiving antiretroviral therapy. Methods This was a cross-sectional study of 257 HIV-positive adults conducted at the Hematology Clinic of the Lagos State University Teaching Hospital, Ikeja, Nigeria. Respondents were selected using a systematic random sampling method. Study instruments used were as follows: the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), the four-item Morisky Medication Adherence Scale (MMAS-4), the Multidimensional Perceived Social Support Scale (MPSSS), and a socio-demographic/clinical data questionnaire. Data were analyzed using the EPI-Info statistical analysis software version 7.0 (Atlanta, GA: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention). Univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analyses were done to determine the prevalence and predictors of depression among HIV-positive adults. Results The prevalence of depression was 54%, and predictors of depression were being unmarried (n=91, OR=10.9, 95% CI=4.6-26.2, p=0.000), female gender (n=119, OR=5.8, 95% CI=2.2-15.5, p=0.000), low social support (n=57, OR=11.2, 95% CI=4.1-30.8, p=0.000), and unemployment (n=27, OR=0.2, 95% CI=0.1-0.7, p=0.007). Conclusion Depression is frequently reported among HIV-positive adults, and its occurrence may be influenced by clinical, social, and demographic-related factors. These variables need to be considered in patient care at antiretroviral clinics in order to achieve a good treatment prognosis. Furthermore, future research may focus on intervention studies on depression in HIV-positive adults, especially in those with increased vulnerability to depression.",,,

This narrative review discusses validated ophthalmic applications across corneal, retinal, and glaucoma filtration surgeries. It emphasizes the capsule's emerging role as a tissue-engineering scaffold for cultivating corneal endothelial cells, limbal epithelial stem cells, and retinal pigment epithelial cells, demonstrating significant promise in regenerative ophthalmology. However, variability in harvesting techniques, small graft sizes, and limited long-term clinical data currently hinder its broader clinical implementation. Future directions highlight the necessity of standardizing capsule harvesting and preservation protocols, potentially in collaboration with eye banks, to enhance accessibility and utility. Additionally, this review explores speculative applications, including encapsulation devices for drug and cell delivery, ultraviolet cross-linking for keratoconus management, and novel scaffolds for optic nerve regeneration and retinal transplantation. While preliminary evidence strongly supports the capsule's versatility, rigorous clinical trials and comparative analyses remain essential to establish long-term safety, efficacy, and optimal surgical integration.

Methods NIH-funded clinical trials related to OUD during the opioid epidemic between March 1, 1997, and February 28, 2023, were extracted from ClinicalTrials.gov and NIH RePORTER. Data extracted from each project included grant type, grant category, grant funding amount, and the PI's affiliation, academic rank, highest degrees, and gender. Non-parametric statistical analysis was performed using Kruskal-Wallis testing to investigate for discrepancies in NIH funding between genders and waves of the opioid epidemic. Results A total of 197 trials were identified as funded during the opioid epidemic, for a total of $1,646,512,558. Of the grants, 85.8% (N=169) were awarded during the third wave of the opioid epidemic; they received a median of $2,482,291 per year, significantly more than the second wave (p=0.0045). Male PIs (54.3%, N=107) received the highest number of grants, but they did not receive significantly more funding compared to female PIs (p=0.8646). A statistically significant difference in funding between the waves (p=0.0015) was found, with projects starting during the third wave receiving more average yearly funding (N=169) than the first two waves (N=28). Conclusion NIH funding amount and number of projects funded increased throughout the third wave of the opioid epidemic, potentially due to increased NIH initiatives during this time. Unlike other documented trends outlining disparities in funding between male and female researchers in academic medicine, there was no statistical difference in funding for clinical trials during the opioid epidemic. Further analysis is needed to ensure a diverse research landscape and determine areas for future improvement.",Barnett BS; Anand A,Department of Psychiatry and Psychology,
40370893,Infectious Diarrhea in Kidney Transplant Recipients.,,Cureus,10.7759/cureus.82194,"Introduction Infectious diarrhea represents a significant and frequent complication among kidney transplant recipients, primarily due to the immunosuppressive therapy required to prevent graft rejection. This condition poses substantial risks to both graft function and patient survival, driven by increased susceptibility to opportunistic pathogens and potential medication-related gastrointestinal effects. This study aims to characterize the pathogen spectrum and associated risk factors of infectious diarrhea in a German cohort of kidney transplant recipients, providing insights into regional patterns and clinical implications. Methods A retrospective cohort study was conducted, analyzing 604 patients, including 436 kidney transplant recipients, who were hospitalized with infectious diarrhea (ICD-10 codes A00-A09) at the Universitätsklinikum Düsseldorf (UKD) between January 2019 and December 2023. Nontransplant patients (n = 168) were included as a comparison group to evaluate pathogen distribution and infection risk specific to immunosuppressive therapy in transplant recipients. Pathogen identification was performed focusing on stool samples. Data collected included transplantation status, dates of admission and transplantation, recurrence rates, and detailed immunosuppressive regimens. Statistical analyses were applied to evaluate pathogen distribution, temporal patterns, and the influence of immunosuppression on infection risk.

40370889,Distance Traveled by Colorectal Liver Metastasis Patients to the Nearest Cancer Hospital To Receive Liver Metastasectomy.,,Cureus,10.7759/cureus.82250,"Background Liver metastasectomy for colorectal liver metastasis (CRLM) has been found to be associated with higher overall survival in select patients. However, this aggressive surgical treatment option is underutilized. At the county level, there is variation in undergoing surgery for CRLM that is associated with county-level poverty rates. However, in contrast, county-level variation in odds of undergoing surgery for stage I colorectal cancer (CRC) was not associated with county-level poverty rates. The objective of this study was to evaluate the impact of distance traveled as a barrier to surgery for CRLM compared to its impact on surgery for stage I CRC. Methods We previously used the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Research Plus (SEER) database to perform an ecological, cross-sectional, and county-level analysis of the county-level proportion of patients with CRLM diagnosed between January 1, 2010, and December 31, 2018, and as a comparator group, we included county-level proportion of patients with stage I CRC. In this study, we mapped out the variation in receiving surgery for CRLM or for stage I CRC that exists in states that contribute data to SEER. We also evaluated the correlation between the driving distance in miles from the center of a county to the closest National Cancer Institute (NCI) designated cancer center or Commission on Cancer (CoC) accredited cancer program and proportion of patients with CRLM and stage I CRC who received surgery at the county level. Results A total of 191 counties were included, and these included counties in which residing patients had access via land travel to an NCI-designated cancer center or CoC-accredited cancer program. Counties that had high rates of surgery for CRLM had the shortest distance to the nearest NCI-designated cancer center (63.1 and 46.5 miles, respectively). The distance to the nearest NCI-designated cancer center significantly differed between counties that were discordant and favored CRLM surgery and counties that were concordant and low for both CRC and CRLM surgery (p=0.02). The median distance to the nearest NCI-designated cancer center ranged from 46.5 miles to 114.5 miles among these four groups of categorized counties. Including the 25",,,
40370881,Real-World Evidence of Langer's Axillary Arch: Bridging Anatomical Variations and Surgical Practice for Safer Axillary Procedures.,,Cureus,10.7759/cureus.82177,"Langer's axillary arch is an anatomical variant characterized by a fibromuscular band extending from the latissimus dorsi to the pectoralis major, humerus, or coracoid process, traversing the axillary region. This structure may alter expected anatomical relationships and has the potential to compress neurovascular elements, thereby complicating surgical procedures. Although extensively described in cadaveric studies, in vivo identification during surgery remains infrequently reported. Given its anatomical variability and potential impact on surgical outcomes, further intraoperative documentation of this variant is clinically relevant and may contribute to improved surgical safety and planning. We present the case of a 65-year-old female with left axillary lymph node metastases from melanoma, undergoing complete axillary lymphadenectomy. Intraoperatively, a fibromuscular structure consistent with Langer's axillary arch was identified, extending from the latissimus dorsi and crossing the neurovascular bundle before inserting on the humerus. Careful dissection was performed to preserve vital structures and ensure oncologic completeness. The lymphadenectomy was successfully completed with histologically clear margins. The patient tolerated surgery well, received adjuvant immunotherapy, and remains disease-free after one year of follow-up. The recognition of Langer's axillary arch during the procedure was critical in preventing inadvertent vascular or nerve injury, ensuring a safe and effective intervention. By bridging anatomical research with clinical practice, this case underscores the clinical importance of anatomy during surgical procedures in the axilla. Failure to recognize Langer's axillary arch can increase the risk of surgical complications, including neurovascular injury or incomplete dissections. The ",Soares J; Vieira R,Dermatology,
40370870,Early Diagnosis and Cardiac Complications of Kawasaki Disease in a Resource-Limited Regional Hospital.,,Cureus,10.7759/cureus.82205,"Introduction Kawasaki disease (KD) is a type of vasculitis that mainly affects young children and is treated effectively with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) when given promptly. Coronary artery aneurysm (CAA) is the most significant complication, occurring in 25% of untreated cases. However, this risk drops to 3% with IVIG treatment. This study aims to describe the clinical characteristics and cardiac complications of children diagnosed with KD at Al Rustaq Hospital (ARH). Methods A retrospective study was conducted on children under 13 years of age diagnosed with KD between January 1, 2010 and December 31, 2023. Data were retrieved from the hospital's electronic records using the ICD-10 diagnostic code and cross-checked with pharmacy records of IVIG administration. Anthropometric, clinical, radiological, and biochemical data were collected and analyzed. Results Fifty children were identified, including 27 males (54.0%). The median age at presentation was 24 months (IQR: 14-43), and the median duration of fever was four days (IQR: 3-6). Diagnosis and initiation of IVIG treatment occurred at a median of two days (IQR: 1-3). Eight children (16.0%) were resistant to the first dose of IVIG. No significant differences were found between IVIG-resistant and IVIG-responsive groups in terms of age at diagnosis, fever duration, timing of IVIG administration, CRP, serum albumin, or alanine aminotransferase levels. The median CRP level significantly decreased from 143.3 mg/L before IVIG to 62.4 mg/L after treatment (p < 0.001). Six children (12.0%) had CAA on initial echocardiography, with only three (6.0%) showing persistent CAA on follow-up echocardiography eight weeks later. No significant associations were observed between CAA development and age at diagnosis, fever duration, CRP levels, albumin levels, or timing of IVIG administration. Conclusions KD is rarely encountered in regional hospital settings. Nonetheless, patients at ARH presented early, and diagnosis and treatment were initiated promptly despite the limitations of a secondary care facility. This early recognition and rapid management likely contributed to reducing long-term cardiac complications in children with KD.",Al Awaidy S,Epidemiology and Public Health,
40370869,Maternal Cell-Free DNA Analysis in a Fetus Affected by Beckwith-Wiedemann Syndrome: Potential for Prenatal Diagnosis.,,Cureus,10.7759/cureus.82215,"Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (BWS) is a condition present from birth that involves excessive growth and is linked to changes in specific genes located on chromosome 11p15.5. Prenatal diagnosis is mainly based on imaging findings such as macrosomia, macroglossia, and omphalocele, but detection remains difficult. We report a case of a fetus suspected of having BWS based on prenatal ultrasound and MRI. A female infant was delivered via cesarean section at 37 weeks and one day of gestation, showing macrosomia, macroglossia, and other clinical features consistent with BWS. To explore potential biomarkers for prenatal diagnosis of BWS, maternal blood was collected at 36 and 37 weeks of gestation and postpartum days 1 and 5. Cell-free DNA (cfDNA) analysis revealed a bimodal fragment size distribution with peaks at 144 and 166 bp during pregnancy. After delivery, the 144 bp peak disappeared, resulting in a unimodal pattern. The fetal fraction was elevated during pregnancy (33.9-34.5%) and decreased rapidly postpartum (to 3.4%). These findings suggest an increased release of fetal-derived cfDNA with BWS-affected fetuses. This case highlights the potential utility of cfDNA analysis as a noninvasive biomarker for BWS.",,,

It can also occur in non-lactating women due to a variety of factors such as diabetes, immunosuppression, and trauma. The microbiological etiology of breast abscesses is important for determining effective antibiotic therapy and preventing complications. This study aims to identify the microbiological profile of breast abscesses, characterize the common pathogens, and analyze their antibiotic resistance patterns. A retrospective analysis was conducted on 108 patients diagnosed with breast abscesses between June 2023 and January 2025. Hospital records were retrieved and reviewed. Demographic data, microbiological findings and antibiotic treatment outcomes were extracted. The primary objective was to identify the main pathogens causing breast abscess. The secondary objective was to understand the antibiotic resistance patterns and the prevalence of coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) in breast abscesses. Microbiological cultures were obtained from abscess aspirates or purulent drainage material. The bacterial isolates were identified using standard microbiological techniques. Antibiotic susceptibility testing was performed using the disk diffusion method. The mean age of participants in the study was 26±2 years. Of the 108 women, approximately 84% had lactational breast abscesses, and the remaining 16% had non-lactational breast abscesses.

This study aims to investigate the factors influencing the QOL of DTC survivors. A total of 860 DTC survivors who underwent thyroidectomy were surveyed. Participants completed the Chinese version of the Thyroid Cancer-Specific Quality of Life (THYCA-QOL) questionnaire, the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Core Questionnaire-C30 (EORTC QLQ-C30), and additional related questions. Multivariate regression analyses identified factors affecting survivors' QOL. Among the survivors, 65 patients (7.6%) reported long-term postoperative complaints, including fatigue, throat discomfort, neck/shoulder stiffness, weight gain, and insomnia, among others. The average THYCA-QOL summary score was 20.29, with the highest scores in problems with scar, psychological problems, gained weight, less interest in sex, and sympathetic problems. The average EORTC QLQ-C30 summary score was 82.59, with lower scores for emotional and cognitive on the functional scales, and higher scores for fatigue and insomnia on the symptom scales. Women, BMI ≥ 28, higher T-stage (T3 + 4), permanent hypoparathyroidism, recurrence reoperation, and more postoperative complaints were associated with poorer thyroid cancer-specific QOL, while age over 45 years was associated with better QOL. Longer postoperative follow-up (>6 months) and drinking were correlated with higher QLQ-C30 summary scores, while recurrence reoperation and postoperative complaints were associated with worse QOL. The QOL of DTC survivors is influenced by multiple factors, with some patients experiencing long-term complaints. Attention to the QOL and postoperative complaints in DTC survivors is essential.",,,

The current study aimed to compare the responsiveness of these three disability measures and establish their minimal important differences (MID) in the same population. A total of 308 patients (M = 36.1, SD = 12.7) who were recruited from outpatient clinics and completed all measures at the two assessment points were included in the current study. The MID was estimated using a triangulation approach while the internal and external responsiveness was evaluated using standardized response mean and receiver operating characteristic curves, respectively. The best MID estimates for the WHODAS, SDS, and SOFAS were three, four, and six points, respectively. The internal responsiveness analysis showed that all three disability measures were well responsive in patients with improved or stable Patient Health Questionnaire-8 and Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 scores at the 6-month follow-up. Meanwhile, the external responsiveness analysis demonstrated that all three disability measures showed adequate responsiveness to improvement, with AUC values of at least 0.7. However, when improvement criteria incorporated MID, only WHODAS was found to be adequately responsive.

While much research has focused on WM structure, the dysfunctional organization of WM in MDD remains poorly understood. Using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging data from 48 MDD patients and 68 healthy controls (HC), we characterized the WM functional connectome gradients across participants and identified both global and regional alterations in MDD. Furthermore, we examined the relationship between gradient properties and depressive symptom severity. External validation and sensitivity analyses were finally conducted to ensure the reliability of results. The principal WM connectome gradient extended from the forceps major and superior longitudinal fasciculus to the uncinate fasciculus (UF) and anterior thalamic radiation (ATR), exhibiting a superficial-to-deep pattern in both groups. Compared to HC, MDD patients displayed a narrower gradient range and lower spatial variation, indicating a contracted WM hierarchy. At the tract-specific level, MDD patients exhibited lower gradient scores in the forceps minor, left ATR and UF, and bilateral cingulate gyrus and cingulum hippocampus, but higher gradient scores in the forceps major, bilateral inferior longitudinal fasciculus and superior longitudinal fasciculus. WM tract gradient patterns explained 37.2% of the variance in clinical severity, with the strongest contributions from the inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus, cingulum hippocampus, ATR, UF, and corticospinal tract. These findings highlight altered WM functional connectome gradient in MDD and their association with clinical severity, offering novel insights into the neurobiological mechanisms of the disorder and potential biomarkers for symptom evaluation.",,,

It is proposed therefore that consideration be given to classifying prime mass amino acids as such, beyond the more common, familiar definitions associated with the other physicochemical properties of amino acids including charged or non-charged, hydrophobic or hydrophilic, polar or non-polar, acidic or basic, aliphatic or aromatic. Greater focus could also be given to such residues during peptide and protein sequencing with mass spectrometry and the construction of structural maps, given their predominantly hydrophobic character and thus their role in protein folding and transmembrane domains. The use of prime numbers to define amino acids based on the sum of the atomic masses from their elemental compositions invokes other recent interest and observations whereby prime numbers were organised in a way that mirrors electrons arranged within the orbitals of an atom.

This study's objective was to generate preliminary evidence that answers these questions, which are relevant because GPs themselves will ultimately harness the power of LLMs in primary care. Non-probability sampling was utilised: GPs practicing in the UK and who were members of one of two Facebook groups (one containing a community of UK primary care staff, the other containing a community of GMC-registered doctors in the UK) were invited to complete an online survey, which ran from 06 to 13 November 2024. The survey received 113 responses, 107 of which were from GPs practicing in the UK. When LLM accuracy and safety were assumed to be guaranteed, broad enthusiasm for LLMs carrying out various nonclinical and clinical tasks in primary care was reported. The single nonclinical task and clinical task that respondents were most supportive of were the LLM listening to the consultation and writing notes in real-time for the GP to review, edit, and save (44.0%), and the LLM identifying outstanding clinical tasks and actioning them (51.0%), respectively. Respondents were concerned with a range of issues regarding LLMs being embedded into clinical systems, with patient safety being the most commonly reported single issue of concern (36.2%).

This study undertakes a systematic literature review to examine the influence of integrated health management on hospital administration. The principal aim is to synthesise a structured body of knowledge capable of informing strategic clinical decision-making and shaping future research trajectories. This investigation employed the Constructivist Knowledge Development Process (ProKnow-C), a methodological framework implemented in four sequential stages: (i) the selection of pertinent peer-reviewed literature to construct a representative portfolio; (ii) bibliometric analysis to evaluate the impact and consistency of sources; (iii) systemic analysis to categorise thematic dimensions; and (iv) the identification of research gaps and prospective avenues for investigation. A total of 20 scholarly articles were scrutinised using both quantitative and qualitative criteria. Three principal approaches to integrated hospital management were identified: (1) the utilisation of management tools-such as the Balanced Scorecard and performance indicators-to improve service delivery efficiency; (2) strategies for performance enhancement, underpinned by strategic planning, detailed operational analysis, and robust internal controls; and (3) financial management approaches, grounded in hospital information systems and evidence-based decision-making. Bibliometric findings confirmed the internal coherence of the selected portfolio, while the systemic analysis demonstrated the presence of shared conceptual frameworks throughout the literature. This systematic review contributed to the consolidation of a structured knowledge base concerning integrated hospital management and highlighted critical areas for future research. Further enquiry is warranted into models for clinical risk mitigation, the optimisation of resource allocation, and the development of financially viable management practices. The ProKnow-C methodology proved robust and suitable for guiding research within the domains of clinical evaluation and healthcare management.",Avila DE; Gil DN,Universidad Pablo de Olavide; Universidad del Azuay,

Understanding the perspective of different parties regarding collaboration is a step towards ensuring an alignment between policy and routine clinical practice. This study explored the meaning of collaboration from the perspectives of informal carers and mental health clinicians in a rural Australian mental health service. This qualitative descriptive study used purposive sampling to recruit informal carers (n = 7) and mental health clinicians (n = 14) from an acute mental health inpatient facility. Data was generated from focus groups and semi-structured interviews and analysed using thematic analysis. Three overarching themes were identified: three-way partnership, purposeful exchange and communication is everything. Clinician and informal carer participants described collaboration as a respectful partnership that necessarily involves the consumer, their carers and clinicians. The purpose of the partnership was identified as providing holistic care to the consumer, which essentially includes support for their carer. Open and clear communication, as well as information sharing, were identified as important to collaboration. However, the experiences of informal carers did not reflect this description of collaboration. Adequate support for informal carers, recognition of their expertise and open and consistent communication are key to a collaborative process that delivers better outcomes for consumers and their carers. Proactive clinician training and a practical guide to inform the delivery of routine informal carer engagement in mental health services are required to achieve an effective three-way collaboration.",,,

This study aimed to identify the key outcome domains for community mental health research in Japan, as determined by multiple stakeholders. First, a comprehensive list of outcome domains was compiled by scoping reviews, focus group interviews, and web-based questionnaire surveys. This was followed by two rounds of preliminary surveys with multiple stakeholders. Finally, three rounds of a web-based Delphi survey were conducted to determine the most important outcome domains of community mental health research in Japan. A total of 96 outcome domains were evaluated by 297 participants, with a response rate of 93.6%. This study identified 24 outcome domains that are essential for community mental health research in Japan. These 24 domains, which reached a consensus, included aspects related to comprehensive symptom assessment and personal recovery. Given that community care serves patients with diverse illnesses, identifying outcome domains that are broadly applicable across different community care settings rather than being limited to specific conditions is critical for future research. The study also highlights differences in perspectives among stakeholders regarding the importance of various outcomes. Despite these differences, several outcome domains have been recognised as being significantly important in the overall consensus.

40369796,Machine Learning for Predicting Postoperative Functional Disability and Mortality Among Older Patients With Cancer: Retrospective Cohort Study.,2025-05-15,JMIR aging,10.2196/65898,"The global cancer burden is rapidly increasing, with 20 million new cases estimated in 2022. The world population aged ≥65 years is also increasing, projected to reach 15.9% by 2050, making cancer control for older patients urgent. Surgical resection is important for cancer treatment; however, predicting postoperative disability and mortality in older patients is crucial for surgical decision-making, considering the quality of life and care burden. Currently, no model directly predicts postoperative functional disability in this population. We aimed to develop and validate machine-learning models to predict postoperative functional disability (≥5-point decrease in the Barthel Index) or in-hospital death in patients with cancer aged ≥ 65 years. This retrospective cohort study included patients aged ≥65 years who underwent surgery for major cancers (lung, stomach, colorectal, liver, pancreatic, breast, or prostate cancer) between April 2016 and March 2023 in 70 Japanese hospitals across 6 regional groups. One group was randomly selected for external validation, while the remaining 5 groups were randomly divided into training (70%) and internal validation (30%) sets. Predictor variables were selected from 37 routinely available preoperative factors through electronic medical records (age, sex, income, comorbidities, laboratory values, and vital signs) using crude odds ratios (P<.1) and the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator method. We developed 6 machine-learning models, including category boosting (CatBoost), extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), logistic regression, neural networks, random forest, and support vector machine. Model predictive performance was evaluated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) with 95% CI. We used the Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) method to evaluate contribution to the predictive performance for each predictor variable. This study included 33,355 patients in the training, 14,294 in the internal validation, and 6711 in the external validation sets. In the training set, 1406/33,355 (4.2%) patients experienced worse discharge. A total of 24 predictor variables were selected for the final models. CatBoost and XGBoost achieved the largest AUCs among the 6 models: 0.81 (95% CI 0.80-0.82) and 0.81 (95% CI 0.80-0.82), respectively. In the top 15 influential factors based on the mean absolute SHAP value, both models shared the same 14 factors such as dementia, age ≥85 years, and gastrointestinal cancer. The CatBoost model showed the largest AUCs in both internal (0.77, 95% CI 0.75-0.79) and external validation (0.72, 95% CI 0.68-0.75). The CatBoost model demonstrated good performance in predicting postoperative outcomes for older patients with cancer using routinely available preoperative factors. The robustness of these findings was supported by the identical top influential factors between the CatBoost and XGBoost models. This model could support surgical decision-making while considering postoperative quality of life and care burden, with potential for implementation through electronic health records.",,,

Previous studies have mainly focused on their challenges in work participation. There has been limited attention on their job tenure strategies. This qualitative study aimed to identify job tenure strategies of people with BPD who are currently employed. Between November 2021 and March 2024, participants completed an online survey combining questionnaires and qualitative open-ended questions covering eleven themes, such as task management, adherence to workplace rules and self-perception of competence. The sample comprised 103 women, 22 men, and five non-binary persons, with an average age of 35. In addition to BPD, about half of the participants reported co-occurring diagnoses, such as anxiety disorders. For 54% of participants, their current primary job was aligned with their formal training. For 65%, it corresponded to their personal interests, and for 83%, with their competencies. To maintain well-being and performance at work, participants reported using strategies that involved balancing work and daily life through stable routines and health-supporting lifestyle habits. Key strategies enabling work functioning focused on self-regulation, cultivating positive workplace relationships, as well as task and time management. Organizing a calm work environment that facilitates concentration, using stress reduction and emotional regulation techniques, and seeking support from colleagues and managers were frequent examples. The findings highlight a variety of self-directed, interpersonal and task-related actions that people with BPD use to maintain job tenure when employed. These personalized strategies can enrich the development of sustainable work reintegration interventions. Future research should examine the empirical effectiveness of these strategies and explore additional job tenure factors, such as work accommodations tailored to the needs of people with BPD.",Corbière M,Department of Education and Pedagogy,Nadine.Lariviere@USherbrooke.ca.

Mirroring challenges experienced elsewhere, clinical trials conducted in Switzerland often face overoptimistic budget estimations and insufficient funding, leading to trial discontinuation and research waste. As a first step to address this problem, we investigated the current approaches to estimate clinical trial budgets in Switzerland. We collected and examined the budgeting tools and approaches for clinical trials provided by the seven Swiss clinical trial units (CTUs) and the Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF). We compared available approaches to the publicly accessible budgeting tool of the Belgian Health Care Knowledge Centre (KCE). For each approach, we collected data about user-testing, the availability of prespecified cost items, and estimates on cost ranges. We found substantial heterogeneity in budget calculation approaches used by Swiss CTUs. None of the currently used tools and approaches provided by the seven CTUs or the SNSF was user-tested and neither supplied cost ranges for investigators to rely on. Five CTU tools included a detailed list of cost items. The SNSF provided a costing template with broad categories and is available for open grant applications only. One CTU tool was publicly available. The publicly available Belgian KCE tool was developed with user feedback and provided a detailed list of cost items, some cost ranges, and an instruction manual. Stakeholders should consider improving budgeting practices in Switzerland by standardizing cost items and user-testing approaches.

This study examines the significance of initial vital signs and blood gas analysis (BGA)-derived values as clinically useful early indicators of mortality risk in critically ill patients, both during in the resuscitation room care and within the following 30 days, with a focus on evaluating the individual predictive performance of accessible clinical parameters. We pooled data from two consecutive retrospective observational studies in a German university ED to analyze an unselected patient population of non-traumatic critically ill patients. Vital signs, such as heart rate, systolic blood pressure, and BGA values (including pH, bicarbonate, carbon dioxide, glucose, lactate, electrolyte levels) on admission to the ED, were used to estimate the impact on both resuscitation room and 30-day mortality. In 1,536 critically ill patients, pH, lactate and bicarbonate were found to be potential predictors of resuscitation room mortality. In contrast, vital signs showed limited reliability in predicting outcomes. Of all tested variables, pH demonstrated the highest area under the curve (AUC) value among the analyzed markers for resuscitation room mortality (AUC 0.81 [95% CI 0.75-0.87]). However, the AUC of pH for 30-day mortality decreased to 0.64 ([0.6 - 0.68], indicating a complex interplay of factors influencing long-term outcome. A subgroup analysis based on pH showed a substantial increase in resuscitation room and 30-day mortality for patients with a pH below 7.2 as well as a second increase below 7.0. Our study highlights important parameters for the assessment of critically ill patients at ED admission that are helpful for formulating immediate medical decisions. Acidosis on the initial BGA appears to be a relevant prognostic marker for mortality in critically ill, non-traumatic patients and may aid in early risk assessment, regardless of the underlying condition. Early detection of acidosis could facilitate rapid decision-making and timely identification of patients requiring intensive care.",,,Michael.Bernhard@med.uni-duesseldorf.de.
40369632,Mitochondrial dysfunction fuels drug resistance in adult T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia.,2025-05-15,Journal of translational medicine,10.1186/s12967-025-06423-4,"T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) is a relatively rare hematological malignancy, characterized by the uncontrolled proliferation of immature T lymphoblasts and associated with a generally unfavorable prognosis. Our previous research has demonstrated that decreased mitochondrial activity is associated with the aggressiveness of T-ALL tumors. However, the mechanisms underlying this phenomenon and its contribution to treatment resistance remain largely elusive. We have built up the largest known T-ALL tumor bank, with a median follow-up of 32 months, including our transcriptomic data from 79 newly sequenced tumors that adds to the 54 publicly accessible samples. Computational analyses and a series of functional assays were performed to investigate the molecular links between altered mitochondrial activity and drug resistance. The transcriptomic analysis revealed that down-regulation of mitochondrial activity is a potent driver of ABCB1 activation, a gene strongly associated with multidrug resistance. In tumors with low mitochondrial activity, the impaired fatty acids β-oxidation leads to intracellular lipid accumulation, which is directly involved in ABCB1 activation. Indeed, our data show that lipid neo-synthesis and accumulation promotes the activation of lipogenic transcription factors, liver X receptors (LXRs), which act as drivers of ABCB1 expression. Tumor data analyses confirmed that high ABCB1 expression in tumour samples is indeed associated with reduced mitochondrial gene expression, lipid droplet enrichment, increased tumour aggressiveness, and significantly shorter patient survival. Our study demonstrates that reduced mitochondrial activity drives multidrug resistance in adult T-ALL via lipid-mediated activation of ABCB1. These findings enhance our understanding of the biology of aggressive T-ALL and provide insight into mechanisms of resistance to conventional chemotherapy. Consequently, we propose that targeting de novo lipogenesis and restricting dietary fats, such as caprylic acid, may help overcome treatment resistance in patients with T-ALL exhibiting low mitochondrial activity.

Primary care medical record-based cohort study containing 43,977 people newly diagnosed with type 2 diabetes and 43,977 without diabetes. Variables were identified using established Read codes. A weighting approach with Cox regression was used to decompose the total effect into the direct effect and indirect effect, mediated by metabolic health (which was defined as the number of metabolic factors developed during follow-up). Estimates were expressed as hazard ratios (HR). Confounders were identified using a DAG. Sensitivity to unmeasured confounding, extreme weights, and missing data were tested. The total effect of type 2 diabetes on the development of frozen shoulder was HR = 4.38 (95% CI: 3.70-5.21), the natural indirect effect (mediated through metabolic health) was HR = 0.98 (95% CI: 0.93-1.03) and the natural direct effect was HR = 4.46 (95% CI: 3.68-5.41). Results were robust to unmeasured confounding, extreme weights, and missing data. This study suggests that type 2 diabetes may be a cause of frozen shoulder but does not support the hypothesis that the effect is mediated by metabolic health. Clinicians should remain alert that shoulder pain in people with diabetes could be indicative of a frozen shoulder. This study should raise awareness that, despite often being overlooked, musculoskeletal conditions can be complications of diabetes and should be considered during clinical conversations with patients. 19_219R.",,,d.van.der.windt@keele.ac.uk.

The clinical environment can present ethical challenges for nurses. A lack of honesty can lead to significant issues for both nurses and patients. Existing tools for measuring honesty have limitations and do not focus specifically on nurses. This study aimed to design and psychometrically evaluate a scale to measure honesty among nurses. This methodological study involved the design and validation of an honesty measurement tool for nurses. The study employed an inductive-deductive approach to generate items. The face (10 nurses), content (10 nursing experts), and construct validity (320 hospital nurses) of the scale were assessed, along with reliability using internal consistency and stability methods. The Item Impact Method was used for quantitative face validity determination. Content validity was assessed using qualitative and quantitative methods, with the participation of researchers and nursing experts. Cronbach's alpha was used to assess internal consistency, and the test-retest method and Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC) were used to assess reliability. Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) was used to assess construct validity. The study resulted in an 8-item tool with two dimensions: behavioral honesty and verbal honesty. The tool explained 51.034% of the total variance. Cronbach's alpha for the entire scale was 0.823, and McDonald's omega was 0.898. The Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC) was reported as 0.918, with a 95% confidence interval of 0.827 to 0.961. The developed tool is a reliable and valid instrument for measuring honesty among nurses. This study contributes to the field by providing a tool to measure honesty in nurses. The tool's scoring system effectively distinguishes between different levels of honesty in nursing practice, with elevated scores reflecting greater adherence to honest professional conduct.

In China, however, the incidence of consulting services for health examination items is low and the current health examination item package is insufficiently personalized. Therefore, we created and evaluated a clinical decision support system (CDSS) for personalized health examination items. An ontology with the data properties as the core design was created to guide the knowledge expression. A knowledge graph composed of ontology-guided property graphs was developed to provide rich and clear decision-making knowledge. The system, including the web for primary care clinicians and the app for participants, was constructed to directly assist primary care clinicians through personalized and interpretable health examination item recommendations. The enter rate and mapping rate were created to evaluate the system's capability to process input health feature data. The two-step expert evaluation was designed to assess whether recommendations with several health examination items were appropriate for participants. The system recommendations and existing packages were compared to the expert's gold standard. There were 15 classes, 2-level class hierarchies, 3 types of object properties, and 16 types of data properties in the health examination item recommendation ontology. Several different data properties could express a piece of complex decision-making knowledge and reduce the number of classes. There were 584 classes, 781 object properties, and 1094 data properties in the knowledge graph.

This study aimed to identify barriers and facilitators to PROMs data collection in inpatient specialist palliative care settings and to assess data collectors' applied perspectives on four relevant PROMs. We conducted an explanatory sequential mixed-methods study, including an online survey (N = 29) and qualitative interviews (N = 12) with healthcare professionals and researchers from eleven countries. These participants had direct experience with PROMs data collection in specialist palliative care settings, either as part of the international iLIVE project or the Austrian PallPROMS study. The aim was to identify opportunities for optimising clinical care and other assessment purposes in the future. We conducted a descriptive analysis of the survey data and a thematic analysis of the qualitative data. The main reflected factors were patients' very limited ability to self-complete PROMs and the optimal timing and duration of assessments. Opinions on the usefulness of different PROMs varied significantly according to the role of the participants. Overall, setting-specific PROMs assessing symptom burden were preferred to more generic quality-of-life/wellbeing measures. Identified barriers and facilitators related to five themes: patient-related factors, data collection processes, PROM type, staff perceptions and organisational factors. Findings also highlighted better information and training needs. Prioritising care-relevant tools and carefully planning data collection, with main barriers addressed, can significantly increase the successful implementation of PROMs collection in specialist palliative care institutions.

In recent years, China has introduced a new evidence system for the review and approval of TCM products, which proposed using human-use experience (HUE) for real-world evidence (RWE) to support the safety and effectiveness of TCM. This study aimed to comprehensively analyse the regulatory concerns, policy guidances, and approved cases of using HUE to register TCM products. Literature search and thematic analysis were conducted to identify and synthesize the regulatory concerns. A documentary analysis of policy guidances was employed to present the evolving regulatory framework for incorporating HUE into TCM registration in China. Case studies of approved TCM products using HUE to support registration were conducted, and the study design, study population, and postmarked requirements of these cases were analyzed. Four main themes and 12 sub-themes regarding regulatory concerns of applying HUE in the registration of TCM products were identified. The 4 main themes are HUE quality, HUE applicability, HUE governance, and HUE regulation. Six policy documents and seven technical guidances were released to facilitate the application of HUE in TCM registration, founding a practical regulatory framework for TCM product registration. In China, six cases that employed HUE to support registration were approved. Of these, five cases utilized HUE to support direct registration, while one utilized HUE to lay the foundation for subsequent phase III clinical trial. Regarding study design and data types, retrospective observational studies were the predominant approach and electronic health records from the hospital information systems were the most commonly used data source. Among the five cases of direct registration, three relied solely on retrospective observational studies, while two conducted small-sample prospective studies in conjunction with retrospective observational studies. HUE can be advanced to generate RWE for the safety and effectiveness of TCM products, which provides potential support for registering new TCM products. Leveraging HUE for registration can shorten research and development period, reduce development costs, and promote innovation, ultimately driving the growth of the TCM industry. However, several challenges remain in using HUE to support the registration of TCM products in China, including difficulties in data accessibility, lack of standardized protocols for HUE collection and reporting, and obstacles in transforming TCM preparations from hospitals into new TCM products using HUE. Furthermore, ensuring high-quality HUE requires future attention to data applicability, data infrastructure, and research design.",,,yunfeng.lai@hotmail.com.

Brisk compared to slow walking pace was associated with multivariable-adjusted lower risks of five cancers, including anal (hazard ratio 0.30; 95% confidence interval: 0.14-0.63), hepatocellular carcinoma (0.39; 0.23-0.66), small intestine (0.46; 0.24-0.87), thyroid (0.50; 0.29-0.86), and lung cancer (0.60; 0.51-0.70). Our findings were consistent across various sensitivity analyses, which assessed sex and age differences, residual confounding, and reverse causation. Self-reported walking pace was inversely associated with risk of five cancer types, even when accounting for overall physical activity and walking volume. Adopting a brisk walking pace may represent a pragmatic target for public health interventions to decrease cancer risk, particularly in circumstances where increases in walking volume or frequency prove impractical.",Ferrari P; Fervers B; Fontvieille E; Freisling H; Friedenreich CM; Gunter MJ; Peruchet-Noray L,Department of Prevention Cancer Environment; Department of Cancer Epidemiology and Prevention Research; Nutrition and Metabolism Branch,michael.stein@ukr.de.

Data were draw from the ACACIA project (March 2021-April 2023) across seven provinces in China. A total of 2139 visits were made to 1167 primary healthcare institutions. Unannounced standardized patients (USPs) were utilized to covertly assess the sanitation facilities during clinical visits. Toilet sanitation facilities were available in 70.4% of visits. 95% had access to piped water. The probability of having a handwashing sinks in toilet and examination room is 79.2% and 50.8%. Significant regional disparities were observed, with southern regions exhibiting higher facility coverage compared to northeastern regions. Public primary healthcare institutions have more sanitary facilities than private ones. Higher-tier institutions have higher rates of sanitary facilities. Regarding quality, adverse event rates show minimal differences between clinic-level and center-level institutions. And the urban institutions is obviously better than that in rural areas. China's policy initiatives have improved sanitation facilities within primary healthcare institutions, but gaps persist in essential components and maintenance. Continued efforts are needed to enhance sanitation infrastructure to meet higher standards and ensure comprehensive coverage. The study's insights can inform both domestic and global strategies for improving healthcare sanitation, contributing to the achievement of international health goals. Future research should focus on identifying barriers to sanitation improvements and developing targeted interventions to standardize sanitary facilities in primary healthcare settings.",,,romanxu@i.smu.edu.cn.

We aimed to determine the prevalence of frailty and its association with decline in IC among people aged 60 and over in Cameroon. This cross-sectional study included community-dwellers aged ≥ 60 years. Frailty was assessed using Fried's criteria and IC decline using step 1 of the Integrated Care for Older People (ICOPE). Any abnormality reported for one of the six IC domains was considered as a positive screening. The significance level was p < 0.05. Among 108 participants included (64.8% women, median age 70 years (65-75)), all had a decline of at least one IC. The prevalence of frailty was 52.8%.The main domains involved were cognition (93.5%), vision (88%) and hearing (87%). Compared to participants without frailty, the frail group was older, achieved lower education, had fewer children, had a more frequent history of falls and a higher number of deficits in IC domains. In the multivariable model, after adjusting for age, sex and comorbidities, the participants with preserved mobility (OR 0.18, 95%CI 0.068-0.49) and vitality (OR 0.11 95%CI 0.04-0.28) were likely to have a lower risk of frailty.

40369455,Barriers and delays to healthcare at time of death: qualitative analysis of Los Angeles County death records of people experiencing homelessness.,2025-05-15,BMC public health,10.1186/s12889-025-22509-6,"Human health and homelessness are incompatible with one another. People experiencing homelessness (PEH) experience extreme health and social inequities, including a significantly higher mortality rate and lower life expectancy compared to the general adult population. While many studies have attempted to identify the most common causes of death, no study to our knowledge has sought to contextualize these deaths using death records. The objective of this study was to conduct a qualitative analysis of the Los Angeles County medical examiner records of people experiencing homelessness from 2018 in order to identify modifiable barriers and delays in accessing health care services. This study was a qualitative analysis of medical examiner records produced by the Los Angeles County Department of the Medical Examiner (DME). In 2019, the study's senior author (EC) entered into a data use agreement with DME to provide records of deaths (n = 998) among people experiencing homelessness in 2018. The DME dataset was entered into a single file for coding using NVivo 12. Using thematic analysis as outlined by Braun and Clarke, the authors iteratively identified themes related to barriers and delays in healthcare to create a codebook. A strength of this study was its identification of barriers and delays to care themes (in italics) proximal to the deaths of PEH, an outcome that community and healthcare organizations aim to reduce. PEH are often suffering from extreme states of death due to advanced disease and have significant difficulty managing their health conditions, which manifests as medication non-adherence, missed dialysis, and a lack of preventative care. These factors, as well as disengagement and early termination of care and a lack of a bystander response to PEH distress may have contributed to these deaths. People experiencing homelessness experience many barriers and delays to care which may be linked to untimely deaths. This study highlights the importance of healthcare and community organizations serving PEH to foster social cohesion, understand reasons for PEH's early termination and/or non-acceptance of care, and adopt equity-oriented care approaches, which aim to improve individuals' ability to engage in outpatient services and treatment.",,,bishopru@musc.edu.

Crowdsourcing has a group of individuals solving a specific problem before sharing solutions with the public. This approach enhances community engagement and ownership of the solutions and can be used to generate culturally relevant solutions. We used crowdsourcing to seek innovative strategies to optimise PrEP access by increasing the uptake and effective use of PrEP. This study describes the experiences of crowdsourcing open calls in Australia, the Philippines, Thailand and China. Four crowdsourcing open calls were conducted between 2021-2023 in Australia, the Philippines, Thailand and China. All open calls entailed: 1) problem identification; 2) committee formation with local groups; 3) community engagement for idea submission (e.g., texts, posters, pitches); 4) evaluation of submissions; 5) awarding incentives to finalists; and 6) solution dissemination via web and social media. We reported the number of total and high-quality submissions. We also identified themes across countries. The Australian, Filipino, Thai and Chinese teams received 9, 22, 9 and 19 eligible submissions, respectively. A total of 3, 10, 7 and 8 submissions had a mean score of 6/10 or greater. Three common solutions emerged across all the finalist ideas: enhanced service access, optimising promotional campaigns, and person-centred promotional materials. The winning ideas from the Australian, Filipino, Thai and Chinese teams were an anonymous online PrEP service, a printed ready-to-wear garment to create awareness about PrEP, PrEP and HIV self-testing kit dispensing kiosks and a poster on PrEP effectiveness, respectively. Crowdsourcing was a promising and versatile tool for developing PrEP strategies in the Asia-Pacific region. Further evaluations via clinical trials can bridge the gap between idea generation and implementation, creating the empirical evidence that is pivotal for the policy adoption of these innovations.",Castillo-Carandang NT,Foundation for the Advancement of Clinical Epidemiology,Jason.ong@monash.edu.

Although the precise pathogenesis and mechanisms of HFS remain unclear, inflammatory reactions are thought to be involved. The preventive effects of topical diclofenac gel have been reported from India. However, the trial did not evaluate its preventive effect for the sole, and the HFS incidence in the control group was lower than that in previous reports. Therefore, this study aims to confirm the preventive effects of diclofenac sodium 0.1% cream for capecitabine-induced HFS. This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial. Patients scheduled to receive capecitabine-containing chemotherapy are enrolled, and participants are prophylactically treated with topical diclofenac sodium 0.1% cream or placebo alongside standard preventive therapy. The primary endpoint is an incidence of grade 2 HFS within 3 months. The secondary endpoints include time to onset of HFS, incidences of dose reduction, schedule delay, discontinuation caused by capecitabine-induced HFS, dose intensity of capecitabine, an incidence of grade ≥ 2 peripheral sensory neuropathy, incidences of other capecitabine-related adverse events (nausea, vomiting, appetite loss, diarrhea, oral mucositis, pigmentation, abnormality of liver and renal functions, and neutropenia). If this study meets the primary endpoint, a new standard preventive therapy for HFS will be established.

This has enabled the development of polygenic scores (PGSs), which aim to aggregate the impact of multiple common genetic variants across the genome to provide an overall genetic risk score for disease manifestation and disease severity. In this review, we discuss the latest findings pertaining to GWASs and PGSs for DCM and various ways in which PGSs could improve the management of patients with DCM or risk of developing DCM. In 2024 the two largest GWAS meta-analyses for DCM were published. Notably, both studies produced PGSs that were able to discriminate healthy subjects from DCM patients which brings promise for potential clinical application of the scores. Large-scale GWAS have identified common genetic variants associated with DCM, leading to the development of PGS, which show strong associations with disease risk and hold potential for clinical applications. However, before clinical implementation, further research is needed to explore their utility in real-world settings and across diverse populations.",,,a.s.amin@amsterdamumc.nl.

NEC is known to cause highly severe and prolonged pain that has been associated with adverse short- and long-term effects. However, research on pain management in infants with NEC is scarce. This is likely due to its low incidence and very acute occurrence. As a result, the optimal pain management for these vulnerable infants remains unknown, and analgesic therapy practices are highly variable. Therefore, we aimed to establish expert-based consensus recommendations on pain management for NEC. Experts of the European Society for Paediatric Research (ESPR) Special Interest Groups on Neonatal pain and NEC were invited to participate in two consensus meetings. Prior to the first hybrid consensus meeting, an online survey provided input for potential recommendations. During the consensus meetings, experts shared clinical expertise and voted on recommendations. An expert consensus statement, comprising nine recommendations on optimal pain assessment and pain treatment in infants with NEC, was developed. Expert recommendations included regular pain assessments with a neonatal pain scale with additional assessments on indication and pre-emptive administration of analgesic therapy (e.g., paracetamol and an opioid) in infants with NEC stage ≥ II. This expert consensus statement provides clinical recommendations essential for any healthcare professional caring for premature infants with NEC. The recommended guidance this statement provides on pain management strategies is key to preventing and reducing pain in this vulnerable population. • Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is a very painful disease, making effective pain management essential. • Current pain management practices for infants with NEC are highly variable. • This expert consensus statement provides recommendations on optimal pain assessment and pain treatment in infants with NEC. • These clinical recommendations may help better prevent pain in these vulnerable infants.",Allegaert K; Cavallaro G; Durrmeyer X; Garrido F; Giannì ML; Martin CR; Pirlotte S; Smits A; Tauzin M,Department of Pediatrics; Neonatology; Neonatal Intensive Care Unit; Division of Neonatology; Department of Development and Regeneration,j.tenbarge@erasmusmc.nl.

Therefore, the biological and clinical impact of high numbers of SVs in patients is unknown. We introduce tumor break load (TBL), defined as the sum of unbalanced SVs, as a measure for SV-associated genomic instability. Using pan-cancer data from TCGA, PCAWG, and CCLE, we show that a high TBL is associated with significant changes in gene expression in 26/31 cancer types that consistently involve upregulation of DNA damage repair and downregulation of immune response pathways. Patients with a high TBL show a higher risk of recurrence and shorter median survival times for 5/15 cancer types. Our data demonstrate that TBL is a biologically and clinically relevant feature of genomic instability that may aid patient prognostication and treatment stratification.

To recapitulate this complex pathophysiology, we engineer macrophage-augmented organoids (MaugOs) by integrating human macrophages into primary intestinal organoids. Echovirus 1, echovirus 6, rotavirus, seasonal coronavirus OC43 and SARS-CoV-2- known to directly invade the intestine- are used as disease modalities. We demonstrate that these viruses efficiently propagate in MaugOs and stimulate the host antiviral response. However, rotavirus, coronavirus OC43 and SARS-CoV-2, but not the two echoviruses, trigger inflammatory responses. Acetate, a microbial metabolite abundantly present in the intestine, potently inhibits virus-induced inflammatory responses in MaugOs, while differentially affecting viral replication in macrophages and organoids. Furthermore, we provide a proof-of-concept of combining antiviral agent with either anti-inflammatory regimen or acetate to simultaneously inhibit viral infection and inflammatory response in MaugOs. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that MaugOs are innovative tools for studying the complex virus-host interactions and advancing therapeutic development.",,,p.li@erasmusmc.nl.

While nurses napping during night shifts has been proposed as a strategy to mitigate these effects, its implementation remains controversial and understudied from a managerial perspective. This study aimed to explore nursing and medical managers' perceptions of, and support for nurses' night shift napping policies in intensive care units. A qualitative descriptive approach was employed from the beginning of March 2024 to the end of October 2024, utilising semi-structured interviews with 40 nursing and medical managers from various intensive care units. Participants were purposively sampled to ensure diversity in experience and department. Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim and analysed using thematic analysis. Five main themes emerged: (1) Understanding perceptions of night shift napping, (2) perceptions of the benefits of night shift napping, (3) assessing support for night shift napping, (4) barriers and challenges of applying napping strategies and (5) developing effective implementation strategies to facilitate the successful adoption of napping policies. While most managers acknowledged the potential benefits of night shift napping, they expressed apprehension about its practical implementation, staff coverage concerns and the potential for policy abuse. Supportive managers emphasised the importance of education, structured guidelines and gradual cultural change to successfully integrate napping practices. The findings suggest that while there is growing recognition of the potential benefits of night shift napping, significant barriers to implementation persist. The results can inform the development of evidence-based napping policies and guide strategies to address managerial concerns, ultimately improving night shift working conditions and patient care quality. Researching the perceptions and support of nursing and medical managers for night shift napping in ICUs is relevant to clinical practice, as it can provide insights into the potential benefits, challenges and strategies for implementing such policies. These findings may ultimately improve patient safety, staff well-being and quality of care.",,,

Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated using Cox hazard regression. A total of 483,532 participants were followed for a median of 14.3 years. Compared with participants without any disease, those with stroke and diabetes had higher age- and sex-adjusted HRs for all-cause mortality (HR 3.9; 95% CI, 3.28-4.56). Moreover, the age- and sex-adjusted HRs for CVD mortality were highest in participants with stroke, ischemic heart disease, and diabetes (HR 10.6; 95% CI, 6.16-18.25). These patterns remained consistent after additional adjustments for smoking status and body mass index. The risk of premature mortality followed similar trends but was more pronounced.

This review synthesizes findings from recent studies comparing 3D laparoscopy with traditional two-dimensional (2D) methods. It highlights the advantages, challenges, and clinical outcomes associated with the adoption of 3D technology in gynecological surgeries. Key benefits of 3D laparoscopy include enhanced depth perception and spatial orientation, which lead to improved surgical precision and shorter learning curves for surgeons. Studies have demonstrated that 3D laparoscopy results in reduced operative times, less blood loss, and quicker recovery periods. Moreover, it offers significant advantages in complex procedures such as endometriosis excision and urogynecological surgeries. However, the ergonomic challenges and higher costs associated with 3D systems remain barriers to widespread adoption. Comparative studies have shown that 3D laparoscopy can be a cost-effective alternative to robotic systems, providing similar clinical outcomes. Training with 3D technology has been shown to enhance skill acquisition among trainee surgeons, suggesting that its integration into surgical training programs could be highly beneficial. Despite its advantages, further research is needed to address the ergonomic concerns and to explore the long-term cost-effectiveness of 3D laparoscopy in routine clinical practice. This review underscores the potential of 3D laparoscopy to become a standard approach in gynecological surgery, provided that ongoing technological and ergonomic improvements are made.",,,leechyilong@gmail.com.

The aims of this review are to highlight the key insights gained from monitoring the MCFC over 20 years, and to discuss the challenges and advantages of establishing such a cohort in a rare disease like cystic fibrosis. Adult people with cystic fibrosis were recruited from 2004 onward in Montreal, Canada, excluding those already diagnosed with cystic fibrosis-related diabetes. Clinical and biological results (including oral glucose tolerance tests) were recorded regularly. Findings from the MCFC contributed to a better understanding of cystic fibrosis-related diabetes pathophysiology (in particular, the joint roles of reduced insulin secretion and added insulin resistance) and its relationship with lung function. Over the years, we observed a shift towards overweight and obesity among cystic fibrosis patients, along with improved lung function. This could be due to improved cystic fibrosis care and to the introduction of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator modulators. We were also able to validate new, simplified screening modalities and management strategies ( The MCFC has contributed to the understanding of cystic fibrosis-related diabetes and informed best practice guidelines.

A sample of 490 individuals, who were on average 28 years old (SD = 10.85) and predominantly female (77.3 %), completed questionnaires to assess primary emotions (PE), personality organization (PO) and TU. Correlation analysis and structural equation modelling was applied to examine the role of PE and PO in TU. The final model explained approximately 6 % of the variance in TU and revealed that negative primary affects such as SADNESS and ANGER had indirect effects on TU that were mediated by PO, which in turn showed direct effects on TU. The results of this study underscore previous findings suggesting that specifically negative emotions may play an important role in addictive disorders and hint a connection to PO as well. Along these lines, TU is suggested as a dysfunctional attempt to regulate negative affects, which could be targeted in therapeutic interventions.",,,human.unterrainer@univie.ac.at.

We explored experiences of health service access and provision of support for people with chronic bowel symptoms after pelvic radiotherapy, from the perspectives of cancer survivors and health professionals. Our aim was to highlight processes and contextual factors that may hinder access to effective support and treatment. We carried out semi-structured interviews with 28 cancer survivors (14 female) with experience of post-radiotherapy, chronic bowel symptoms, and 19 health professionals involved in the care of such patients. Recruitment was through three NHS hospitals, cancer charities and professional networks. Data were analysed thematically, deductively (guided by the Model of Pathways to Treatment (MPT)) and inductively. We organised data around three overarching themes positioning experiences within MPT's event sequence or describing health system factor. Gratitude for treatment of cancer, embarrassment and acceptance of symptoms led survivors not to seek further care. Health professionals not recognising symptoms or focusing only on discounting cancer recurrence were barriers to effective care for those who sought it. System barriers included professional specialities working in isolation and geographical disparity in availability of late-effects services.

Keyword co-occurrence analysis was also conducted to identify dominant research areas and trace their evolution over time. Findings revealed a substantial rise in research output, increasing from 15 publications in 1995 to 456 in 2024. Citation impact peaked in 2017, with a gradual decline in subsequent years. The most prolific authors included Hogg P., Bolderston A., and Reed W., while the University of Salford, University of Toronto, and University of Sydney emerged as the leading institutions across the three journals. The United Kingdom, Canada, and Australia were dominant contributors, with a notable rise in participation from African and Asian countries. Funding was primarily supported by national health agencies, cancer-focused organizations, and academic institutions. Keyword analysis revealed nine major thematic clusters, including diagnostic imaging technologies, oncology, clinical practice, education, patient-centered care, and public health. Importantly, eight highly cited papers (≥100 citations) were identified, many of which contributed significantly to the professionalization of radiography, expanded the role of radiographers in diagnostic reporting, and integrated emerging technologies such as AI and digital imaging-marking key milestones in the field's development. In summary, this study presents the large-scale, journal-inclusive bibliometric profile of radiography research. It offers new insights into global contributions, and collaboration patterns, thus serving as a valuable foundation for shaping future research strategies.",Alhusayni AM,Health Holding Company,waseem_anw@yahoo.com.

This change in tasks may challenge existing core patterns of work and professional identities. This study explores the interactions between professional identity and new technologies of HCV point-of-care testing. Between September 2023 and January 2024, in-depth, semi-structured interviews were conducted with people involved in HCV policymaking in Australia. The sample consisted of 29 participants working in seven Australian jurisdictions or nationally: 13 from departments of health, six from community-led organisations, five from local health districts, and five from pathology services. Data were coded according to themes identified in a prior conceptual review of professional identity. Analysis explored the bidirectional relationship between professional identities and the implementation of point-of-care testing. Three themes were identified which explain the role of professional identity in influencing implementation of HCV point-of-care testing. Everyday interpersonal interactions influenced perceptions of risk. Maintaining high quality in point-of-care testing is valued across professions but the interpretation of quality is varied. Workers who deliver services directly to people at risk of HCV emphasise agility as a characteristic of their group identity which also distinguishes them from other professions. Professional identities are shaping the rollout of HCV point-of-care testing. The prioritisation of risk, agility, and quality in professional identities shape the possibilities for HCV point-of-care testing. The analysis demonstrates the inextricability of new technology from the people who deliver it.",Treloar C,Centre for Social Research in Health,a.conway@unsw.edu.au.

Also known as chromomycosis, this condition typically manifests as insidious onset cutaneous lesions that eventually progress to cause physical disability. CBM is considered a Neglected Tropical Disease (NTD) by the World Health Organisation (WHO) due to its significant impact on impoverished populations throughout tropical regions, the paucity of research, and the opportunity to improve treatment and prevention. In many cases, the diagnosis is delayed; this is thought to be due to the multitude of clinical mimics and the lack of general awareness. Furthermore, the subcutaneous invasion of this infection creates therapeutic challenges. A small number of studies have identified partially successful treatments and potential pharmacological targets. Herein we present an updated review of this condition to give a contemporary perspective on a neglected disease.",,,

Performance measures were used to enhance team accountability and address challenges due to limited evaluate to health insurance and variations in clinical staff decision-making. Rehabilitation and observed variability in surgical costs were not measured in this study. Similar studies were also referenced, and improvements in real-time glioma management were suggested. Performance measures and standardizing practices were recommended to improve cost predictability despite the observed cost variability caused by individualized care. ■ The molecular test according to the WHO classification of CNS tumors (gliomas) was performed in 100% (172) of patients. ■ Education on chemotherapy and informed consent for patients with brain tumors was carried out for 100% (130) of the patients who had an indication for chemotherapy treatment. ■ Approximately 87% of the patients with gliomas underwent postoperative cranial MRI. ■ A multidisciplinary approach, including molecular testing, was used for 35% of patients with glioma. ■ Thromboembolic events after resection of the primary brain tumor occurred in only 0.84% (3) patients. To evaluate the quality indicators proposed by the American Academy of Neurology and Neuro-oncology Society in patients with primary intracranial central nervous system tumors. This study is a retrospective level I analysis that used electronic medical records from the CERNER system and GDOC-SAME at the tertiary hospital. It was approved by the Research Ethics Committee and followed the Declaration of Helsinki. Data was collected and analyzed confidentially via REDCap. The research focused on patients 18 or older with primary central nervous system tumors who had surgery from August 2015 to August 2021. It excluded surgeries performed elsewhere, reoperations, secondary (metastatic) tumors, and primary central nervous system tumors outside the cranium. The results showed that 48% of the patients had gliomas, whereas 30 and 21.6% had meningiomas and other types of tumors. Quality measures showed that 35% of the patients with grade 2-4 tumors had multidisciplinary care plan discussions. All patients with gliomas underwent molecular testing and those eligible who underwent chemotherapy were educated and provided informed consent. Postoperative magnetic resonance imaging within 72h was performed in 87% of gliomas. The length of hospital stay, postoperative complications, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group status at discharge, and 30-day status were also potential quality measures. However, for meningioma cases, readmissions were associated with patients in the American Society of Anesthesiologists II (58.33%) and American Society of Anesthesiologists III-IV (41.67%). The study conclusions revealed that adherence to quality indicators was good; however, improvements are needed in multidisciplinary care plans and postoperative imaging. Quality measures can be enhanced by controlling factors such as American Society of Anesthesiologists and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group scales at admission, epileptic seizure occurrence, neurological deficits, and tumor size in meningiomas.

Effective longitudinal care models are needed to provide patients with updated information and to obtain patient and family history updates. To bridge this gap, we aimed to develop a patient- and genetic provider-informed digital genetic health portal (GHP), MyCancerGene, to improve longitudinal patient understanding of and responses to genetic testing. We used a 5-step process to develop MyCancerGene. To better understand their interest in and willingness to use a digital GHP, we surveyed 307 patients who completed genetic testing (step 1). We completed qualitative interviews with 10 patients and a focus group with 17 genetic providers to inform the content and function of MyCancerGene (step 2). Next, we developed initial intervention content (step 3) and completed user testing of intervention content with 25 providers and 28 patients (step 4). After developing the prototype intervention, we completed usability testing with 8 patients for their feedback on the final content, functions, and ease of use (step 5). In surveys conducted in step 1, 90% of patients with positive results reported interest in a digital GHP, and over 75% of participants with variants of uncertain significance or uninformative negative results reported similar interest. The most frequently reported advantages among patients were increasing accessibility, convenience, and efficiency (103/224, 46%); keeping genetic information organized (54/224, 24.1%); and increasing or maintaining patient understanding of the information (38/224, 17%). In qualitative interviews (step 2), both patients and genetic providers endorsed the benefit of the tool for updating personal and family history and for providers to share new risk information, test interpretation, or other medical changes. Patient and provider input informed eight key components of the tool: (1) Landing Page, (2) Summary of Care page, (3) My Genetic Test Results page, (4) My Family History page, (5) Provide an Update page, (6) Review an Update page, (7) Resources page, and (8) the Screenings Tracker. They also recommended key functions, including the ability to download and print materials and the inclusion of reminders and engagement functions. Potential challenges identified by patients included privacy and security concerns (67/206, 32.5%) and the potential for electronic information to generate distress (20/206, 9.7%). While patients were comfortable with updates (ie, even variant reclassification upgrades or clinically significant results), 44% (11/25) of genetic providers were uncomfortable sharing variant reclassification upgrades through MyCancerGene. MyCancerGene, a patient-centered digital GHP, was developed with extensive patient and genetic provider feedback and designed to enhance longitudinal patient understanding of and affective and behavioral responses to genetic testing, particularly in the era of evolving evidence and risk information.",,,

Glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists (GLP1-RAs) are treatments for diabetes and obesity that may also influence psychiatric outcomes. To conduct a meta-analysis of randomized placebo-controlled trials to evaluate psychiatric, cognitive, and QOL outcomes with GLP1-RA treatment. MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, and CENTRAL databases were searched from inception through June 24, 2024. Double-blind placebo-controlled trials comparing GLP1-RA to placebo in adults with overweight/obesity and/or diabetes, reporting on psychiatric, cognition, or QOL outcomes, were included. Data extraction was performed in parallel by 2 reviewers. Random-effects meta-analysis was performed. Effect size measures were log risk ratios (log[RR]) and standardized mean differences (Hedges g). The quality of studies was appraised using the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool (RoB2). Certainty of evidence was assessed via GRADEpro. Main outcomes were risk of psychiatric adverse events (serious and nonserious) and change in mental health symptom severity, health-related quality of life, and cognition. Eighty randomized clinical trials involving 107 860 patients were included in the meta-analysis. The mean (SD) age of participants across studies in the meta-analysis was 60.1 (7.1) years; 43 251 were female (40.1%) and 64 608 male (59.9%). GLP1-RA treatment was not associated with a significant difference in risk of serious psychiatric adverse events (log[RR] = -0.02; 95% CI, -0.20 to 0.17; P = .87) and nonserious psychiatric adverse events (log[RR] = -0.03; 95% CI, -0.21 to 0.16], P = .76), or depressive symptom change (g = 0.02; 95% CI, -0.51 to 0.55; P = .94), compared with placebo.

Specialist palliative care may be beneficial, but it is unclear which patients are most appropriate for referral and when they should be referred. To identify a set of consensus referral criteria for specialist palliative care for patients with dementia. In this survey study using 3 rounds of Delphi surveys, an international, multidisciplinary panel of clinicians from 5 continents with expertise in the integration of dementia and palliative care were asked to rate 83 putative referral criteria (generated from a previous systematic review and steering committee discussion). Specialist palliative care was defined as an interdisciplinary team consisting of practitioners with advanced knowledge and skills in palliative medicine offering consultative services for specialist-level palliative care in (nonhospice) inpatient, outpatient, community, and home-based settings. Consensus was defined a priori as at least 70% agreement among experts. A criterion was coded as major if the experts advocated that meeting 1 criterion alone was satisfactory to justify a referral. Data were summarized using descriptive statistics. Of the 63 invited and eligible panelists, the response rate was 58 (92.1%) in round 1, 58 (92.1%) in round 2, and 60 (95.2%) in round 3. Of the 58 panelists who provided demographic data in round 1, most were aged 40 to 49 years (28 of 58 [48.3%]), and 29 panelists (50%) each were men and women. Panelists achieved consensus on 15 major and 42 minor criteria for specialist palliative care referral. The 15 major criteria were grouped under 5 categories, including dementia type (eg, rapidly progressive dementia), symptom distress (eg, severe physical symptoms), psychosocial factors or decision-making (eg, request for hastened death, assisted suicide, or euthanasia), comorbidities or complications (eg, ≥2 episodes of aspiration pneumonia in the past 12 months); and hospital use (eg, ≥2 hospitalizations within the past 3 months).

A total of 210 patients with suspected coronary artery disease, who were scheduled for CCTA, were prospectively enrolled and randomly assigned to one of three breath-holding groups: Group A (end-inspiratory breath-hold), Group B (breath-holding during calm respiration), and Group C (end-expiratory breath-hold), with 70 patients in each group. The parameters recorded and analyzed included resting heart rate (during calm respiration), scanning heart rate (during breath-holding), scan length, heart rate variability, radiation dose metrics, and patient comfort levels. Four patients in the end-expiratory breath-hold group (Group C) were unable to maintain breath-hold during scanning, resulting in non-diagnostic images. The remaining 206 patients successfully completed the CCTA. Across all groups, the scanning heart rate was significantly lower than the resting heart rate (P < 0.05). Follow-up assessments revealed that breath-holding during calm respiration provided the highest comfort level. Both the volume scan length and radiation dose were significantly lower in Groups B and C compared to Group A (P < 0.05), with no significant differences observed between Groups B and C (P > 0.05). The image quality in Group C was significantly lower compared to Group A and Group B (P < 0.01).

The World Health Organization reported in 2022 that 2.5 billion adults were overweight, with 890 million classified as obese, emphasizing the urgent need for effective interventions. A critical aspect of obesity's pathophysiology is meta-inflammation-a chronic, systemic low-grade inflammatory state driven by excess adipose tissue, which disrupts metabolic homeostasis. This review examines the role of autolysosomal dysfunction in obesity-related metabolic disorders, exploring its impact across multiple metabolic organs and evaluating potential therapeutic strategies that target autophagy and lysosomal function. Emerging research highlights the importance of autophagy in maintaining cellular homeostasis and metabolic balance. Obesity-induced lysosomal dysfunction impairs the autophagic degradation process, contributing to the accumulation of damaged organelles and toxic aggregates, exacerbating insulin resistance, lipotoxicity, and chronic inflammation. Studies have identified autophagic defects in key metabolic tissues, including adipose tissue, skeletal muscle, liver, pancreas, kidney, heart, and brain, linking autophagy dysregulation to the progression of metabolic diseases. Preclinical investigations suggest that pharmacological and nutritional interventions-such as AMPK activation, caloric restriction mimetics, and lysosomal-targeting compounds-can restore autophagic function and improve metabolic outcomes in obesity models. Autolysosomal dysfunction is a pivotal contributor to obesity-associated metabolic disorders , influencing systemic inflammation and metabolic dysfunction. Restoring autophagy and lysosomal function holds promise as a therapeutic strategy to mitigate obesity-driven pathologies. Future research should focus on translating these findings into clinical applications, optimizing targeted interventions to improve metabolic health and reduce obesity-associated complications.",,,jzeng22@syr.edu.

After item reduction based on a confirmatory scale analysis considering the six-factor structure of the questionnaire versions for older children, adolescents, and adults (Cognition, Self, Daily Life & Autonomy, Social Relationships, Emotions, Physical Problems), its reliability and validity were investigated. The final version of the QOLIBRI-KIDDY comprises 23 items. Psychometric analyses indicated internal consistency to be satisfactory (ɑ = 0.49-0.72; ω = 0.57-0.78). Construct validity suggested the expected overlap between generic HRQoL and TBI-specific HRQoL (r = 0.17-0.36). There were small (r > 0.2) to moderate (r > 0.3) correlations between lower TBI-specific HRQoL and participants with lower learning rates, anxiety, depression, and post-concussion symptoms, particularly on the Cognition, Social Relationships, Emotions, and Physical Problems scales. The comparison of known groups revealed significant moderate and significant effects for lower HRQoL in children with depressive symptoms on the Emotions scale (d = - 0.46) and with post-concussion symptoms on the Cognition (d = - 0.42) and Social Relationships scales (d = - 0.56). The QOLIBRI-KIDDY is a comprehensive, yet economical tool, comparable in content and items to the other age-adapted QOLIBRI versions. Its application has the potential to provide longitudinal data on subjects after TBI from childhood to older age, with a subjective perspective that can contribute to improving the therapy, rehabilitation, and daily life of young children.",Neu A; Wartemann U,Department of Neurology and Neuropediatry; Department of Neuropediatrics,nicole.von-steinbuechel@uibk.ac.at.

This study describes the clinical outcomes of TED patients treated with Teprotumumab across 5 medical centers in Israel and evaluates time-to-improvement. A retrospective cohort study of electronic medical records for Israeli patients treated with Teprotumumab between 2021 and 2024 in five medical centers. The main outcome included changes in proptosis and diplopia. Thirty-two TED patients (mean age 53.3, 19 females) received partial or complete treatment with Teprotumumab. All had previously failed IV glucocorticoids, and some also failed other biologics. Four patients had decompression surgery prior; 3 with optic neuropathy and 1 with proptosis improved after 1-7 doses. Proptosis decreased by 2.4mm (right) and 2.0mm (left) (p < 0.001, p = 0.002, paired sample t-test), with significant reductions in primary gaze diplopia (p = 0.015, chi-square test). Four patients (12.5%) had symptom recurrence 8-12 months post-treatment; one improved with additional treatment. Thirteen patients (40.6%) had significant improvement within 3 infusions. Adverse events included myalgia (n = 4), hyperglycemia (n = 3), diarrhea (n = 3), and hearing issues (n = 4). One patient developed encephalopathy, successfully treated with plasmapheresis. Teprotumumab was effective in reducing diplopia and proptosis among Israeli TED patients, with rapid improvement in nearly half of the cases. Further studies are warranted to confirm these findings in real-world settings.",,,guybensimon@gmail.com.

Recent works have highlighted flaws in citation practices in the Neurosciences, such as the under-citation of women. However, self-citation rates-or how much authors cite themselves-have not yet been comprehensively investigated in the Neurosciences. This work characterizes self-citation rates in basic, translational, and clinical Neuroscience literature by collating 100,347 articles from 63 journals between the years 2000-2020. In analyzing over five million citations, we demonstrate four key findings: (1) increasing self-citation rates of Last Authors relative to First Authors, (2) lower self-citation rates in low- and middle-income countries, (3) gender differences in self-citation stemming from differences in the number of previously published papers, and (4) variations in self-citation rates by field. Our characterization of self-citation provides insight into citation practices that shape the perceived influence of authors in the Neurosciences, which in turn may impact what type of scientific research is done and who gets the opportunity to do it.",,,

CardioOncology,10.1016/j.jaccao.2025.03.005,"Pharmacologic blood pressure (BP) lowering is typically a lifelong treatment, and both clinicians and patients may have concerns about the long-term use of antihypertensive agents and the risk for cancer. However, evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) regarding the effect of long-term pharmacologic BP lowering on the risk for new-onset cancer is limited, with most knowledge derived from observational studies. The aim of this study was to assess whether long-term BP lowering affects the risk for new-onset cancer, cause-specific cancer death, and selected site-specific cancers. Individual-level data from 42 RCTs were pooled using a one-stage individual participant data meta-analysis. The primary outcome was incident cancer of all types, and secondary outcomes were cause-specific cancer death and selected site-specific cancers. Prespecified subgroup analyses were conducted to assess the heterogeneity of the BP-lowering effect by baseline variables and over follow-up time. Cox proportional hazards regression, stratified by trial, was used for the statistical analysis. For site-specific cancers, analyses were complemented with Mendelian randomization, using naturally randomized genetic variants associated with BP lowering to mimic the design of a long-term RCT. Data from 314,016 randomly allocated participants without known cancer at baseline were analyzed. Over a median follow-up of 4 years (Q1-Q3: 3-5 years), 17,954 participants (5.7%) developed cancer, and 4,878 (1.5%) died of cancer. In the individual participant data meta-analysis, no associations were found between reductions in systolic or diastolic BP and cancer risk (HR per 5 mm Hg reduction in systolic BP: 1.03 [95% CI: 0.99-1.06]; HR per 3 mm Hg reduction in diastolic BP: 1.03 [95% CI: 0.98-1.07]). No changes in relative risk for incident cancer were observed over follow-up time, nor was there evidence of heterogeneity in treatment effects across baseline subgroups. No effect on cause-specific cancer death was found. For site-specific cancers, no evidence of an effect was observed, except a possible link with lung cancer risk (HR for systolic BP reduction: 1.17; 99.5% CI: 1.02-1.32). Mendelian randomization studies showed no association between systolic or diastolic BP reduction and site-specific cancers, including overall lung cancer and its subtypes. Randomized data analysis provided no evidence to indicate that pharmacologic BP lowering has a substantial impact, either increasing or decreasing, on the risk for incident cancer, cause-specific cancer death, or selected site-specific cancers.",McKay J; ,Genomic Epidemiology Branch; ,kazem.rahimi@wrh.ox.ac.uk.

This reduced access is associated with poorer maternal and newborn health outcomes and creates logistical and financial barriers to care. Despite closures, factors underlying this trend are not well understood. Administrators, nurses and physicians involved in rural obstetrics at the time of programme closure are well positioned to identify factors contributing to service attrition. This qualitative study aimed to explore their perspectives regarding factors contributing to closure. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with administrators, nurses and physicians involved in rural obstetric programmes in northern Ontario at the time of closure. Interview questions were developed from a literature scan and refined by an experienced practitioner to identify factors influencing closures. Thematic analysis of interviews identified common themes regarding factors perceived to contribute to programme closure. Twelve administrators, 6 nurses and 10 doctors were interviewed. Analysis revealed several perceived factors contributing to programme closures: (1) a decline in obstetric competence and confidence among healthcare workers attributable to inadequate obstetric exposure in schooling, low birth volumes and limited ongoing training opportunities; (2) shortage of health human resources providing obstetric care due to lack of provider reluctance and recruitment challenges and (3) limited support from the provincial government and tertiary referral centres. Closure of rural obstetric programmes in northern Ontario is seen as a result of complex, multifaceted challenges. Understanding these factors can better inform strategies to sustain rural obstetric programmes and prevent further attrition of care. Le nord de l'Ontario continue de subir des fermetures de programmes obstétriques ruraux, ce qui oblige les femmes enceintes à SE déplacer pour obtenir des soins. Cet accès réduit est associé à de moins bons résultats en matière de santé pour la mère et le nouveau-né et crée des obstacles logistiques et financiers aux soins. Malgré les fermetures, les facteurs qui sous-tendent cette tendance ne sont pas bien compris. Les administrateurs, infirmières et médecins impliqués dans l'obstétrique rurale au moment de la fermeture du programme sont bien placés pour identifier les facteurs contribuant à l'attrition des services. Cette étude qualitative avait pour but d'explorer leurs points de vue sur les facteurs contribuant à la fermeture. Des entretiens semi-structurés ont été menés avec des administrateurs, des infirmières et des médecins participant à des programmes d'obstétrique en milieu rural dans le nord de l'Ontario au moment de la fermeture. Les questions ont été élaborées à partir d'une analyse documentaire et affinées par un praticien expérimenté afin d'identifier les facteurs influençant les fermetures. L'analyse thématique des entretiens a permis d'identifier des thèmes communs concernant les facteurs perçus comme contribuant à la fermeture d'un programme. Douze administrateurs, six infirmières et dix médecins ont été interrogés. L'analyse a révélé plusieurs facteurs perçus comme contribuant à la fermeture des programmes: 1) un déclin des compétences obstétricales et de la confiance des travailleurs de la santé, attribuable à une exposition insuffisante à l'obstétrique au cours des études, à de faibles volumes de naissances et à des possibilités limitées de formation continue; 2) une pénurie de ressources humaines en santé fournissant des soins obstétricaux en raison de la réticence des prestataires et des difficultés de recrutement; et 3) un soutien limité du gouvernement provincial et des centres de référence tertiaires. La fermeture des programmes d'obstétrique en milieu rural dans le nord de l'Ontario est considérée comme le résultat de défis complexes et à multiples facettes. La compréhension de ces facteurs peut permettre de mieux informer les stratégies destinées à soutenir les programmes d'obstétrique en milieu rural et à prévenir l'attrition des soins.",,,

However, emerging evidence suggests that nucleolar function extends beyond ribosome production and is particularly important during mammalian development. Nucleoli are dynamically reprogrammed post-fertilisation: totipotent early mouse embryos display non-canonical, immature nucleolar precursor bodies, and their remodelling to mature nucleoli is essential for the totipotency-to-pluripotency transition. Mounting evidence also links nucleolar disruption to various pathologies, including embryonic lethality in mouse mutants for nucleolar factors, human developmental disorders and observations of nucleolar changes in disease states. As well as its role in ribogenesis, new findings point to the nucleolus as an essential regulator of genome organisation and heterochromatin formation. This Review summarises the varied roles of nucleoli in development, primarily in mammals, highlighting the importance of nucleolar chromatin for genome regulation, and introduces new techniques for exploring nucleolar function.",,,

In our study, Lean serves as an example of a management intervention through which we examine how hybrids shape the implementation of managerial interventions in a public hospital. We gathered our data from a longitudinal qualitative study of a Lean initiative implemented in an Australian public hospital. The current analysis is part of a larger case study which involved 87 in-depth semi-structured interviews over three years in a major Australian public hospital. These interviews explored experiences of Lean and included senior managers, middle managers, hybrids, clinical staff and others. In this paper, we focus specifically on the experiences of hybrid medical managers. We demonstrate how the Lean initiative sparks identity-reconciliation work that differs among hybrids working in different parts of the hospital and with various contractual arrangements and levels of participatory voice. The hybrids in our study responded to the introduction of Lean, with heightened identity reconciliation work, but in different ways. This appears to be attributable to the organisational context, and particularly the hybrids' contractual arrangements with the hospital. There is a dearth of research in healthcare management that has sought to understand how hybrids reconstruct their identities in response to top-down implementations of managerial initiatives, such as Lean. Our findings offer healthcare managers practical insights into the engagement of hybrid-medical professionals through our novel understanding of the identity-reconciliation work necessary for hybrid professionals to engage with management initiatives.",Ivcovici A,Yarra Health Services,

It remains a major global health issue, with 263 million cases and 597,000 deaths in 2023, primarily affecting young children and pregnant women. This review evaluates awareness, acceptance, hesitancy, and willingness to pay (WTP) for the RTS,S/AS01 malaria vaccine, along with the key factors influencing these outcomes. A comprehensive literature search was conducted in Web of Science, PubMed, and Embase, covering publications up to 18 June 2024. Observational studies assessing awareness, acceptance, hesitancy, and WTP for the malaria vaccine in endemic regions were included. Two independent reviewers screened the studies. Data extraction was performed using Nested Knowledge software and analyzed with R v.4.4. Pooled prevalences were estimated using random-effects models, and heterogeneity was assessed with the I² statistic. Eighteen studies with 21,975 participants provided insights into malaria vaccine dynamics: 32% awareness (95% CI, 18%-50%), 83% acceptance (95% CI, 75%-89%), 14% hesitancy (95% CI, 7%-26%), and 58% WTP (95% CI, 34%-79%). Key determinants of acceptance included age, where younger adults (18-24 years) showed lower acceptance (OR = 0.64, 95% CI, 0.35-0.93). Employment, particularly farmers, had higher acceptance rates (OR = 3.20, 95% CI, 1.00-7.40). Lower socioeconomic status and larger family sizes were associated with decreased acceptance (OR = 0.18, 95% CI, 0.02-0.38). This review revealed an 83% acceptance rate for the malaria vaccine, with variability in awareness (32%), hesitancy (14%), and willingness to pay (58%). Age, employment, and socioeconomic status were significant determinants of acceptance. However, due to potential publication bias and high heterogeneity, these findings should be cautiously interpreted. The results highlight the necessity for targeted interventions to enhance vaccine acceptance. Further research is required to elucidate factors that influence vaccine acceptance.",Albayat H; Sulaiman T,Infectious Diseases Section; Infectious Disease Department,

The primary aim of the present study was to compare patient-reported arm function and HRQoL up to 3 years after study inclusion in cT1-2 N0 patients with breast cancer undergoing breast-conserving surgery (BCS) with or without SLNB. The secondary aim was to explore the association between personality traits 'trait anxiety' and 'neuroticism', and perceived arm function and HRQoL. A total of 1733 women with unilateral cT1-2 N0 invasive breast cancer treated with BCS with or without SLNB were included. The primary outcomes of arm function (assessed using the Lymphoedema Functioning, Disability, and Health Questionnaire) and HRQoL (assessed using the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer QLQ-C30 and QLQ-BR-23 questionnaires) were analysed. Analyses included 821 patients (383 with SLNB and 438 without SLNB). Those in the SLNB group experienced a slight, temporary decline in arm function (P < 0.025) and reported more HRQoL arm and breast symptoms (P < 0.049). High trait anxiety or neuroticism was associated with significant poorer arm function and lower HRQoL. SLNB slightly reduced arm function, temporarily affecting HRQoL arm and breast symptoms. Neuroticism significantly negatively impacted arm function and HRQoL. Measuring and stratifying for personality traits is crucial for interpreting patient-reported outcomes and to identify patients needing additional support after surgery.

Thanks to continuous advancements in 3D printing technology and ongoing development of tissue-mimicking materials, significant achievements have been made in the production of anthropomorphic head phantoms. A comprehensive narrative review was conducted using Google Scholar as the primary database for literature retrieval. Specific search terms were employed to identify studies on anthropomorphic head MRI phantoms, excluding digital phantoms or animal models. Retrieved literature was then categorized and organized based on the physical properties simulated by phantoms, summarizing preparation methods for anthropomorphic head phantoms and presenting their application examples in MRI. There are two manufacturing options for producing anthropomorphic head phantoms with 3D printing, namely direct and indirect manufacturing, both demonstrating unique merits. Based on physical properties simulated by phantoms, quantitative comparisons between measured values and actual values were conducted, revealing notable discrepancies between them. During phantom fabrication, challenges such as long-term stability, bubble formation, and susceptibility-matching issues are identified. This paper also summarizes optimized strategies addressing these problems. Future head phantoms will achieve multidimensional simulations, replicating not only anatomical structures and physical properties but also physiological activities and functional behaviors. This advancement aims to accelerate the clinical translation of novel, efficient imaging technologies and methodologies. EVIDENCE LEVEL: 5. TECHNICAL EFFICACY: Stage 1.",,,

They aim to translate evidence into practice and optimize clinical outcomes. This is the first update of the previous systematic review (Rotter 2010). To investigate the effect of CPWs on patient outcomes, length of stay, costs and charges, adherence to recommended practice, and to measure the impact of different approaches to implementation of CPWs. For this update, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and Embase were searched on 25 July 2024. Two trial registries were searched on 26 July 2024, along with reference checking, citation searching and contacting authors to identify additional studies. We considered two groups of participants: health professionals involved in CPW utilization, including (but not limited to) physicians, nurses, physiotherapists, pharmacists, occupational therapists and social workers; and patients managed using a CPW. We included randomized trials, non-randomized trials, controlled before-after (CBA) studies, and interrupted time-series (ITS) studies comparing (1) stand-alone clinical pathways with usual care, and (2) clinical pathways as part of a multifaceted intervention with usual care. Two authors independently screened all titles, abstracts and full-text manuscripts to assess eligibility and the methodological quality of included studies using the Cochrane Effective Practice and Organization of Care 'Risk of Bias' tool. Certainty of evidence was assessed by two authors independently. Interventions were scored as 'high', 'moderate' or 'low' for the evidence-based implementation process. The update provided 31 additional studies for a total of 58 included studies (24,841 patients and 2027 healthcare professionals). Forty-one (71%) were randomized trials, four (7%) non-randomized trials, four (7%) CBA studies and nine (16%) ITS studies. Forty-nine studies compared stand-alone CPWs to usual care and nine compared multifaceted interventions including a CPW to usual care. Collectively, the risk of bias was high due to potential contamination by healthcare professionals, lack of blinding of patients and personnel, lack of allocation concealment and selective reporting in ITS studies. Stand-alone clinical pathway interventions It is uncertain whether stand-alone CPWs reduce inhospital mortality (13% v 16%: OR 0.79, 95% CI 0.53 to 1.20; P = 0.27; I² = 65%; 7 randomized trials; n = 4603; low-certainty evidence due to serious imprecision and inconsistency) or mortality (up to 6 months) (4% v 3%: OR 1.37, 95% CI 0.72 to 2.60; P = 0.34; I² = 20%; 3 randomized trials, n = 805; low-certainty evidence due to serious risk of bias and imprecision). Stand-alone CPWs likely reduce inhospital complications (10% v 17%: OR 0.57, 95% CI 0.41 to 0.80; P = 0.001; I² = 52%; 11 randomized trials, n = 3668; moderate-certainty evidence due to serious risk of bias). It is very uncertain whether stand-alone CPWs reduce hospital readmissions (up to 6 months) (9% v 13%: OR 0.67, 95% CI 0.44 to 1.03; P = 0.07; I² = 11%; 9 randomized trials, n = 1578; very low-certainty evidence due to serious risk of bias and very serious imprecision). Stand-alone CPWs likely reduce the length of hospital stay compared to usual care (MD -1.12 days, 95% CI -1.60 to -0.65; P < 0.00001; I² = 64%; 21 studies; n = 5201; moderate-certainty evidence due to serious inconsistency). Costs and charges were generally lower in CPWs as indicated by negative MDs in nine studies (10 studies, n = 2113, data not pooled; very low-certainty evidence due to serious indirectness and very serious inconsistency). Stand-alone CPWs may slightly increase adherence to recommended practice compared with usual care (3 randomized studies, n = 573; data not pooled; low-certainty evidence due to serious risk of bias and serious inconsistency). Multifaceted clinical pathway interventions It is uncertain whether multifaceted CPWs reduce inhospital mortality (2 randomized studies, n = 6304, data not pooled; low-certainty evidence due to very serious inconsistency). Multifaceted CPWs may make little or no difference to mortality (up to 6 months) (9% v 8%: OR 1.05, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.25; P = 0.61; I² = 0%; 3 randomized studies; n = 6531; low-certainty evidence due to serious imprecision and serious risk of bias). It is uncertain whether multifaceted CPWs reduce inhospital complications (9% v 23%: OR 0.32, 95% CI 0.12 to 0.87; 1 study, n = 140; low-certainty evidence due to very serious imprecision). It is uncertain whether multifaceted CPWs reduce hospital readmission (up to 6 months) (2 randomized studies, n =1569, data not pooled; low-certainty evidence due to very serious inconsistency), or length of stay (4 randomized studies, n = 1936, data not pooled; low-certainty evidence due to very serious inconsistency), or hospital costs and charges (4 randomized studies, n = 2015, data not pooled; very low-certainty evidence due to very serious imprecision and serious indirectness in outcome measures). It is uncertain whether multifaceted CPWs increase adherence to recommended practice (2 randomized studies, n = 6304, data not pooled, low-certainty evidence due to very serious inconsistency). Key study characteristics The highest proportion of included studies were from the USA (36%), followed by Australia (10%), China (10%), Japan (5%), the UK (5%), Canada (5%), Italy (5%), and Germany (5%). More than half of the included studies tested CPW in general acute wards (53%), followed by emergency departments (17%), intensive care (14%), and extended-stay facilities (10%). The most common clinical conditions were asthma (16%), stroke (10%), mechanical ventilation (9%) and myocardial infarction (7%). Stand-alone CPWs are likely to reduce inhospital complications and length of hospital stay and may slightly increase adherence to recommended practice. There was little conclusive evidence for multifaceted CPWs due to mixed results from a limited number of included studies. It is uncertain whether stand-alone CPWs or CPWs, as part of a multifaceted approach, reduce inhospital mortality, mortality (up to 6 months), hospital readmission (up to 6 months) or costs and charges.",,,
40365591,Considering the potential unintended consequences of RateMDs: an exploratory study in one specialty.,2025-05-14,Canadian medical education journal,10.36834/cmej.77821,"Websites that facilitate communication between patients regarding their experiences with individual physicians are now relatively commonplace. Given patient-generated ratings are publicly available, physicians could use these to access rarely available patient feedback. We explored the content of reviews associated with low physician ratings and consider the potential benefits and consequences of relying on this form of freely available data to support individual life-long learning. We conducted an exploratory qualitative descriptive study. We collected narrative comments associated with low numerical ratings on one physician-rating website (RateMDs) drawn from one specialty in Canada. Written reviews associated with low numerical ratings (≤2/5) for Canadian otolaryngologists were collected yielding a total of 878 comment sets that were analyzed deductively and iteratively. We found that patient comments described poor performance in areas that aligned, for the most part, with the CanMEDS roles including Professional, Communicator, and Leader; specifically referring to management of the clinical environment, administrative staff, and trainees. While not intended for physician feedback, physicians could access patient-to-patient ratings and associated written reviews as a means to identify areas of practice improvement. However, this represents an unintended use of these websites. While speculative, access to patient-to-patient rating websites could negatively impact physician confidence or self-worth - representing a negative consequence of their use. The utilization of these data for potential self-improvement represents an unintended use of patient-to-patient ratings and so may be accompanied by unintended consequences for physicians who use these data as potential feedback, and patients who contribute to physician rating sites. Les sites Web qui facilitent la communication entre les patients au sujet de leurs expériences avec des médecins en particulier sont désormais relativement courants. Étant donné que les évaluations réalisées par les patients sont accessibles au public, les médecins pourraient les utiliser pour accéder aux commentaires rarement disponibles des patients.

Nous avons mené une étude qualitative descriptive exploratoire. Nous avons recueilli des commentaires narratifs associés à des évaluations numériques faibles sur un site Web d'évaluation des médecins (RateMDs) provenant d'une spécialité au Canada. Les commentaires écrits associés à de faibles notes numériques (≤2/5) pour les oto-rhino-laryngologistes canadiens ont été recueillis, ce qui a donné un total de 878 ensembles de commentaires qui ont été analysés de manière analytique et récurrente. Nous avons constaté que les commentaires des patients décrivaient des performances médiocres dans des domaines qui correspondaient, pour la plupart, aux rôles CanMEDS, notamment Professionnel, Communicateur et Leader, en particulier en ce qui concerne la gestion de l'environnement clinique, le personnel administratif et les stagiaires. Bien qu'il ne s'agisse pas d'un retour d'information, les médecins peuvent accéder aux évaluations des patients et aux critiques écrites qui y sont associées afin d'identifier les domaines dans lesquels ils peuvent améliorer leur pratique. Toutefois, il s'agit là d'une utilisation involontaire de ces sites Web. Bien que spéculatif, l'accès aux sites Web d'évaluation des patients pourrait avoir un impact négatif sur la confiance ou l'estime de soi des médecins, ce qui représenterait une conséquence négative de leur utilisation. L'utilisation de ces données à des fins potentielles d'amélioration personnelle représente une utilisation involontaire des évaluations faites par les patients et peut donc s'accompagner de conséquences involontaires pour les médecins qui utilisent ces données comme retour d'information potentiel et pour les patients qui contribuent aux sites d'évaluation des médecins.",,,

40365303,Cost-Utility Analysis of Trastuzumab-Emtansine Versus Trastuzumab for the Treatment of Residual Invasive HER-2-Positive Breast Cancer in Iran.,,Iranian journal of pharmaceutical research : IJPR,10.5812/ijpr-153452,"Breast cancer is one of the most common types of cancer in women, and its incidence is increasing in Iran. HER-2-positive breast cancer is invasive and often associated with poorer outcomes. Patients with this type of breast cancer can develop resistance to medications like trastuzumab. Trastuzumab-emtansine (TDM1) is a medication developed to reduce cancer cell resistance to trastuzumab. The TDM1 has been shown to decrease the incidence of death and recurrence in breast cancer. This study aimed to evaluate the cost-utility and calculate the budget impact of TDM1 versus trastuzumab for the treatment of residual invasive HER-2-positive breast cancer. A Markov model with a lifetime horizon was developed, incorporating four health states. Women aged 45 with residual invasive HER-2-positive breast cancer entered the model. The study adopted a healthcare system perspective, with costs reported in 2021 US dollars. Discount rates of 7% for costs and 3% for utility values were applied. Utility values and transition probabilities were derived from published literature. Costs were estimated based on guidelines, expert opinions, and Iranian tariffs. Iran's pharmacoeconomic threshold of 1085$ was used for comparison. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) and budget impact of TDM1 were calculated, and sensitivity analyses were conducted to assess the robustness of the model. The model indicated that treatment with TDM1 resulted in a 1.59 quality-adjusted life year (QALY) increase, with an additional cost of 1408$. This was deemed cost-effective, considering Iran's pharmacoeconomic threshold of 1085$ (calculated ICER: 886$ per QALY gained). One-way sensitivity analysis revealed that the model was sensitive to the costs of TDM1 and trastuzumab, the discount rates for utility values and costs, and the probability of achieving invasive disease-free survival (IDFS). Probabilistic sensitivity analysis showed that 59.61% of simulations fell below Iran's pharmacoeconomic threshold, supporting the model's robustness. The budget impact analysis revealed that the additional budget required for TDM1 treatment over a three-year period was 1,120,546$ compared to trastuzumab. Although TDM1 imposes higher costs, it is more cost-effective than trastuzumab for the treatment of residual invasive HER-2-positive breast cancer in Iran.",,,

Leveraging the comprehensive Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2021 dataset, we systematically evaluated the worldwide burden of type 2 diabetes mellitus attributable to secondhand smoke (T2DM-SHS) across 204 countries. The analysis encompassed both death and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) across various genders, age groups, and 204 nations over the period from 1990 to 2021. We examined trends and socioeconomic impacts by analyzing age-standardized DALYs rates and estimated annual percentage changes, stratified by socio-demographic Index (SDI) quintiles. The following changes occurred between 1990 and 2021: while age-standardized mortality rates decreased by 8.903% (95% UI: -16.824% to -1.399%), DALYs increased by 17.049% (95% UI: 9.065% to 25.557%). Age-stratified analysis revealed peak death in the 70-74 years group, with females experiencing highest DALYs in the 75-79 years group and males in the 90-94 years group. An inverted U-shaped relationship between SDI and disease burden emerged, with peak rates at moderate SDI levels. Despite lowest burdens in high-income countries, disease dynamics were most complex in middle-range SDI countries, indicating that economic development does not linearly correlate with health outcomes. This comprehensive analysis unveils the multifaceted global landscape of T2DM-SHS, exposing critical disparities across gender, age, and socioeconomic contexts. The findings urgently call for targeted, context-specific public health interventions, particularly in low- and middle-income countries, to mitigate the escalating T2DM-SHS burden.",,,

This is a retrospective case-control study that analyzed 147 ICSI embryo transfer (ET) cycles. The study included 82 subfertile patients (31 patients with ICSI and PBB therapy = case group; 51 patients with ICSI without the PBB therapy = control group). We conducted a statistical analysis of all pregnancies and births resulting from fresh and thawed ICSI cycles, with and without the use of PBB after a single embryo transfer (SET) of a blastocyst (BL). Our main outcome measures were the pregnancy and pregnancy outcome rates after ICSI with and without the PBB.  The implantation rate in the ICSI with PBB group was lower than in the ICSI without PBB group, but there were no significant differences (11 = 17.50% vs. 21 = 25.00%, RR = 0.63, 95% CI: 0.28-1.44, p = 0.37). The yolk sac detection rate in the ICSI with PBB group was lower than in the ICSI without PBB group, but there were no significant differences (8 = 12.70% vs. 16 = 19.00%, RR = 0.62, 95% CI: 0.25-1.55, p = 0.65). The fetal heartbeat rate in the ICSI with PBB group was lower than in the ICSI without PBB group, but there were no significant differences (7 = 11.10% vs. 12 = 14.30%, RR = 0.75, 95% CI: 0.28-2.03, p = 0.75). The live birth rate in the ICSI with PBB group was higher than in the ICSI without PBB group, but there were no significant differences (5 = 7.90% vs. 5 = 6.00%, RR = 1.36, 95% CI: 0.37-4.92, p = 0.88). The total pregnancy loss rate was significantly lower in the ICSI with PBB group than in the ICSI without PBB group (6 = 9.50% vs. 19 = 22.60%, RR = 0.36, 95% CI: 0.14-0.96, p = 0.04).  A bigger patient sample is needed for further evaluation, but based on our findings, we recommend the PBB in the cases of apparent or suspected genetic, maternal diseases and/or aneuploidies and for improving general ICSI outcomes, through the reduction of pregnancy loss rates.

40364870,The Role of Hematological Parameters in Critically Ill Patients: Mortality Prediction in Elderly Intensive Care Unit Patients.,,Cureus,10.7759/cureus.82183,"Background Elderly patients constitute a high-risk population in intensive care units (ICUs) due to multiple comorbidities, frailty, and limited physiological reserves. Despite advances in intensive care, mortality rates remain significantly high in this demographic. Identifying reliable predictors of mortality is crucial for early intervention and improved clinical outcomes. Hematological parameters, such as red cell distribution width (RDW), platelet-related measurements (including platelet count, mean platelet volume [MPV], and platelet distribution width [PDW]), and inflammatory markers like procalcitonin (PCT), have emerged as potential prognostic indicators. However, their predictive value in critically ill elderly patients remains controversial. Aims This study aims to determine whether hematological parameters, including RDW, platelet-related indices (platelet count, MPV, and PDW), and inflammatory markers such as PCT, can predict mortality in elderly patients admitted to ICUs. By establishing their prognostic significance, we seek to enhance early risk stratification and improve clinical decision-making. Methods A retrospective observational study was conducted on 238 patients aged 65 years and older who were admitted to the ICU. Laboratory values, demographic data, and clinical severity scores were analyzed. A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis and logistic regression analysis were performed to assess the predictive value of hematological markers in relation to 39-day mortality. Results Among the study population, mortality occurred in 87 patients (36.6%), highlighting the high-risk nature of the geriatric intensive care cohort. RDW, PDW, MPV, and PCT levels were significantly higher in patients who did not survive (p < 0.0001). The ROC curve analysis identified PCT (area under the curve [AUC]: 0.925, p < 0.0001) and urea (AUC: 0.767, p < 0.0001) as the strongest classifiers of mortality. Logistic regression analysis confirmed PCT (odds ratio [OR]: 1.410, p < 0.0001) and PDW (OR: 1.427, p = 0.013) as independent mortality predictors. Conclusions Hematological parameters, particularly RDW, PDW, MPV, and PCT, are strong predictors of mortality in elderly patients in ICUs. These findings emphasize the role of systemic inflammation and coagulation in clinical outcomes within the intensive care setting. Integrating these parameters into clinical risk assessment models may improve early mortality prediction and allow for more targeted management strategies, ultimately improving survival in critically ill elderly patients.",,,

Management remains challenging and there is a lack of high-quality evidence for efficacy of the different medical treatment options. The aim of this article was to provide clinicians with a framework for decision-making. A literature review was conducted on medical treatment studies, utilising the Strength of Recommendation Taxonomy (SoRT) for grading evidence quality. PubMed, Scopus and EBSCOhost Research Databases (CAB and Medline) databases were searched for relevant publications between 1980 and August 2024, using the keywords: dog and perianal or anal and fistula, ulcer or furunculosis. Recommendations were based on authors' consensus and organised around four relevant clinical questions. Twenty clinical treatment studies were included with evidence assessed and recommendations presented for ciclosporin (alone and in combination with ketoconazole), tacrolimus, prednisolone, azathioprine, photobiomodulation, stem cells, oclacitinib, mycophenolate mofetil, dietary modifications and for surgery following medical treatment. Ciclosporin is recommended as the first-line treatment option with clinical response likely to be dependent on time and dose. In cases where ciclosporin fails, alternatives include the combination of prednisolone and tacrolimus or surgical intervention following medical treatment.

Postmortem examination is a crucial tool for identifying the underlying causes of neonatal death and improving disease diagnosis. However, the anatomical, physiological and histological differences between neonates and adults present unique challenges for necropsy procedures. Establishing a standardised neonatal necropsy protocol is essential for accurately determining the causes of death and associated diseases. This pilot study aimed to standardise a necropsy technique for canine neonates. During the examination, the spleen, heart, lungs, tongue, stomach, intestines, liver, pancreas, kidneys, bladder, brain and bones were collected from nine neonatal canines. The method involved monoblock organ removal, followed by separation on the basis of the standard organisation used in adult necropsies. Histological staining and analysis revealed structural differences between neonatal and adult tissues. Neonatal hepatocytes presented a more basophilic cytoplasm, suggesting high metabolic activity, whereas gastric glands and parietal cells were less developed, indicating ongoing maturation. Additionally, the pancreas, lungs, kidneys and spleen displayed morphological characteristics consistent with those of the early development stages. Understanding these particularities may enhance veterinary diagnostic and clinical approaches, contribute to the development of preventive measures and ultimately reduce neonatal mortality in dogs.

It is unknown how reliably perianal symptoms predict perianal lesions. We recruited pediatric patients with CD who were undergoing colonoscopy for clinical indications. Patients self-reported recent perianal symptoms. We retrospectively reviewed the perianal exam documented on colonoscopy reports and in the electronic health record to obtain details of perianal lesions if present. Thirty-three patients were included: median age 15.6 years (interquartile range 12.9-17.5), 27% female, 80% White. There was no association between any perianal symptom and the presence or absence of any perianal lesion (p = 0.85), suggesting the presence or absence of perianal pain and/or anal discharge does not predict whether a patient with CD has perianal lesions. This raises the importance of perianal examination, regardless of symptoms, for identifying perianal lesions early and enabling treatment aimed at preventing perianal fistula development in patients with CD.",,,

CHI3L1 emerged as the most upregulated protein in recurrent RRMS. ELISA confirmed significantly elevated CHI3L1 levels in recurrent RRMS and secondary progressive MS (SPMS) patients, with levels decreasing in steroid responders but increasing in non-responders. Immunohistochemistry of MS brain autopsies revealed CHI3L1 expression predominantly in mature oligodendrocytes. In an experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) model, CHI3L1 was highly expressed in the spinal cord, particularly in oligodendrocytes and microglia/macrophages. Functional studies demonstrated that recombinant CHI3L1 (rCHI3L1) protected oligodendrocytes from LPC-induced cell death by attenuating ER stress (GRP78, ORP150). Moreover, rCHI3L1 counteracted IFN-β- and PSL-mediated inhibition of oligodendrocyte differentiation. In microglia, rCHI3L1 suppressed LPS-induced proinflammatory markers (IL-1β, iNOS). In vivo, rCHI3L1 administration significantly mitigated EAE severity by reducing gliosis, demyelination, and axonal degeneration.

While national consensus in Italy is absent, the Region of Tuscany has enacted Law No. 16/2025, which establishes a MAID procedure based on recent Constitutional Court rulings. The commentary aims to provide a preliminary analysis of the new law, addressing ethical, medico-legal, and social issues that emerge in relation to the Italian and global debate on the topic. The law establishes a three-stage process based on four eligibility criteria: irreversible disease, psycho-physical suffering, life-support dependence, and informed consent. However, Tuscany's model poses medico-legal and ethical concerns, particularly about the boundaries of regional legislative competence, the duties of healthcare professionals, and the possibility of intra-national inequity or ""health migration."" In addition, critical organisational implications derived from informed consent and lethal drug self-administration impede clinical implementation in some individuals with mental or neurological disorders. The lack of clarity in the different steps of the procedure, the uncertain supervision system, and the potential consequences for specific categories of vulnerable people underline the need for comprehensive national regulation. A future regulatory framework must balance procedural clarity with individual autonomy and equitable access, bringing Italy in line with larger European context for end-of-life care.",,,

Although advancements in digital technology and increasing use of electronic medical records in health systems have led to the dramatic growth of large data sets, the presence of ED clinical registries to measure quality of care in the literature is currently unknown. Our scoping review aims to investigate the extent of emergency department clinical registries reported in peer-reviewed literature. We conducted a scoping review of ED registries in accordance with the PRISMA-ScR checklist. Searches were undertaken in PUBMED, EMBASE, and SCOPUS. Studies were included if they described a clinical registry with a focus on the ED. We identified 60 manuscripts with 27 identified as primary registries (6 had a general scope, 21 were condition or population specific). The remaining 33 papers were investigational reports sourced from the identified primary registries. Funding sources were identified for some registries: three by research grants, two by medical colleges, five by government organizations or initiatives, two by pharmaceutical companies, and three by research institutes. No funding information was provided in 12 studies. The reported registry periods ranged from 31 days to 4018 days (median 365 days, IQR 181-1309 days). A grey literature search revealed that six registries were ongoing. Internationally, there appears to be a wide degree of heterogeneity with primary ED registry publications and secondary publications. Having a standardized approach to ED registries is needed. Integrating ED registries with a learning health system model will enable clinicians to serve their community proactively and with a focus on quality, rather than the current safety-focused approach.",,,

Direct performance encompasses immediate infection control interventions administered to patients, whereas indirect performance constitutes physician communication and documentation protocols. A structured questionnaire was used to survey 176 ICU nurses from a tertiary hospital in Korea. There were no significant differences in CICC infection control performance according to participants' general characteristics. The direct performance of CICC infection control showed a significant positive correlation with clinical experience ( To enhance overall infection control performance among ICU nurses, it is crucial to raise the perception of the importance of patient safety management and implement systematic strategies targeting both the direct and indirect performance of CICC infection control. Healthcare institutions should establish more detailed guidelines distinguishing between direct and indirect performance of CICC infection control and continuously educate ICU nurses on the importance of compliance with both aspects.",,,

Traditional diagnostic methods, such as computed tomography, are not ideal for screening due to their high cost and radiation exposure. In contrast, blood-based diagnostics, as non-invasive approaches, are expected to reduce patient burden, thereby increasing screening participation and ultimately improving survival rates. However, conventional tumor markers have shown limited effectiveness in early detection. We recruited 199 patients with lung cancer and 590 healthy volunteers. Nine tumor markers (CEA, CA19-9, CYFRA, AFP, PSA, CA125, CA15-3, SCC antigen, and NCC-ST439) were analyzed, along with enriched glycopeptides (EGPs) derived from serum proteins using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Machine learning models, including decision trees and deep learning approaches, were employed to develop a predictive model for accurately distinguishing lung cancer from healthy controls based on tumor markers and EGP profiles. We found that α1-antitrypsin with fully sialylated biantennary glycan, attached to asparagine 271 (AT271-FSG), and α2-macroglobulin with fully sialylated biantennary glycan, attached to asparagine 70 (MG70-FSG), could significantly distinguish between patients with lung cancer and healthy individuals. Comprehensive Serum Glycopeptide Spectra Analysis (CSGSA), integrating nine conventional tumor markers and 1688 EGPs using a machine learning model, enhanced diagnostic accuracy and achieved an ROC-AUC score of 0.935. It also identified stage I cases with an ROC-AUC of 0.914, indicating the possibility of early-stage detection. The PPV reached 2.8%, which was sufficient for practical application. This method represents a significant advancement in cancer diagnostics, combining multiple biomarkers with cutting-edge machine learning to improve the early detection of lung cancer.",Tanabe K; Hayashi C,Medical Solution Promotion Department,

Autologous cell-processed products, derived from the tissue of the patient, typically exhibit variability in raw material quality, resulting in the generation of out-of-specification (OOS) products. The compassionate use of OOS products is also practiced by the Food and Drug Administration and European Medicines Agency; differences among the three regulatory authorities were investigated to identify challenges in Japan. For conditions with no alternative treatments and severe time constraints, OOS products are sometimes used under compassionate grounds, particularly in Japan, where they are administered within the framework of clinical trials. This approach, although ethical, imposes significant operational and administrative burdens on medical institutions and marketing authorisation holders, raising concerns about sustainability. We considered the rationalisation of the current system and reached the conclusion that it would not contribute to load reduction and sustainability; thus, we devised a new framework. This study reviewed the compassionate use systems for OOS products in Japan, the United States, and Europe, highlighting current challenges and proposing a sustainable regulatory framework for future practice.",Kitawaki Y; Umezawa A; Oie Y; Kamiya T; Kawamura T; Sato Y; Hosoya S; Sugawara H; Yamada K; Izumoto H; Mae Y; Kuroda T; Okada K,The Japanese Society for Regenerative Medicine; Novartis Pharma K.K; Forum for Innovative Regenerative Medicine,okada.kiyoshi.med@osaka-u.ac.jp.

Limited SSc is more common and typically associated with a milder disease course, whereas diffuse SSc, although less common, is linked to a higher mortality rate due to more frequent visceral organ involvement. One of the most common complications of SSc is interstitial lung disease (ILD). ILD is characterized by fibrosis, scarring, and inflammation of the lungs. ILD has a 30% prevalence and a 40% 10-year mortality in patients with SSc worldwide. Hospitalizations for SSc from 2002 to 2020 were obtained using the National Inpatient Sample (NIS), an all-payer administrative database that captures 97% of hospital discharges in the United States. The primary aim was to evaluate whether inpatient mortality, length of stay (LOS), and hospital cost differed if SSc patients had underlying ILD. We estimated multivariable logistic regression and log-normal models controlling for age, biological sex, race/ethnicity, income, and hospital setting. ILD was associated with 88% greater adjusted odds of inpatient mortality (aOR 95% CI: 1.53 to 2.31, p < 0.001), 15% longer stays (aOR 95% CI: 1.04 to 1.28, p = 0.001), and 33% higher adjusted hospital costs (aOR 95% CI: 1.26 to 1.40, p < 0.001).

We collected both quantitative and qualitative data, which is recommended in evaluating complex interventions to gain a comprehensive understanding of key success factors. Often, congruence is sought and considered desirable when integrating the findings from both data types. However, data are not always congruent, nor is it suboptimal when incongruence occurs, as we illustrate in this case study. We present the divergent findings from a large community-based implementation-effectiveness hybrid type II trial, and how the struggle to reconcile incongruent results yielded rich insights informing the next steps for translational research on the intervention being tested. Previous foundational research, including a pilot study and randomized controlled trial (RCT), showed promising results and supported proceeding with a multi-site pragmatic hybrid type II effectiveness-implementation RCT. This recent RCT was undertaken and quantitative and qualitative data were collected to inform the effectiveness and implementation evaluation. To synthesize the findings and guide integration of this large body of evidence, we developed a conceptual model which combined two existing frameworks: the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research and Quintuple Aim. We used this model to identify the evidence and relate it to relevant implementation and intervention determinants/outcomes. We then synthesized the evidence to distall the main messages regarding the future of the intervention, which involved reconciling apparently discrepant findings from the quantitative and qualitative approaches. The current RCT showed no statistically significant effect for participants for the primary (or secondary) outcomes yet the implementation evaluation consistently found perceived benefits of the intervention for patients, providers, and the healthcare system. Qualitative evidence was critical in understanding contextual factors potentially responsible for the absence of a treatment effect (e.g., COVID-19), strategies to overcome challenges experienced in participant engagement and intervention delivery, and recent policy/practice setting changes which showed strong alignment with the intervention and supported its future implementation. With the goal of the hybrid type II effectiveness and implementation study in mind, stakeholders encouraged proceeding with a scalability assessment to consider the evidence from the current trial within the context of our prior research, the broader literature for similar interventions, and the ever-changing policy context. clinicaltrials.gov NCT03664583.

This study assessed the AGELESS intervention's impact on cognitive, physical, vascular, dietary, and psychosocial outcomes, along with its cost-effectiveness, in a Low-Middle-Income Country (LMIC). The AGELESS randomized controlled trial recruited 106 older adults (above 60 years) from Klang Valley, Malaysia, with (pre)-CF (≥ 1 Fried's criteria and Clinical Dementia Rating scale = 0.5). Participants were randomly assigned to a 24-month multidomain intervention (physical activity, cognitive training, nutritional and psychological counselling, cardiovascular care) or control group (educational module). Primary outcomes, assessed at baseline, 12 and 24 months, included the modified Neuropsychological Tests Battery (mNTB) and physical performance measures. Intervention costs were calculated to determine Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratios (ICERs). An intention-to-treat analysis was conducted to account for attrition. The trial occurred during the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite a 50% dropout rate, adherence among remaining participants was over 50% for all intervention components (range 53%-91%). The intervention led to significant improvements in selected parameters of cognitive function, physical performance, anthropometry, and dietary patterns (for all parameters, p < 0.05 for interaction time*group in repeat-measures ANOVA). The cost per participant was RM 1592.74 (≈USD 355.05) in the multidomain arm, and RM 488.21 (≈USD 108.83) in the control arm. The ICER computation indicated the 2-min step test as the most cost-effective measure (ICER RM 149.19 ≈USD33.26). The AGELESS trial demonstrates that a multidomain, lifestyle-based intervention can improve cognitive and physical function in older adults with (pre)-CF. This cost-effective approach highlights CF as a modifiable health condition and supports its potential inclusion in health policy to promote healthy aging and reduce health risks in LMICs, where there is a larger prevention potential due to prevalent lifestyle-related risk factors.",Ismail A; Ai-Vyrn C; Mohamad M,Department of Public Health Medicine Faculty of Medicine; Centre for Diagnostic; Department of Medicine,suzana.shahar@ukm.edu.my.

Informed by the qualitative descriptive design, forty-five (45) participants were purposively recruited and interviewed, adopting a semi-structured interview guide. Data gathered were subjected to content analysis and interpreted via lenses of the theory of dimensions of healthcare access. The study's findings were layered within areas of improving policy-practice interphase. Consumers called on policy makers to restructure the NHIS to cover indirect costs of accessing healthcare services for adolescents with disabilities. In respect of improving practice, it was also suggested that training and education on disability phenomenon must be extended to all cadres of healthcare workers including administrative staff, who provided services to this marginalized social unit.

The objective of this study is to examine the effect of DSME on different types of costs in older Medicare beneficiaries with diabetes. This was a pooled cross-sectional study using the Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey (MCBS). The use of DSME was reported by survey respondents. Economic outcomes included total medical costs, total diabetes-related medical costs, total prescription costs, and total anti-diabetic prescription costs were measured based on Medicare claims and prescription drug events data from the perspective of the Medicare system. All costs were adjusted to 2012 U.S. dollars using the Consumer Price Index (CPI). Generalized linear models, with a log link and gamma distribution, were used to examine the effect of DSME on different costs. A total of 3,003 older Medicare beneficiaries with diabetes were included, among whom 35.50% (n = 1,066) had DSME. Individuals who did not have DSME had significantly higher total prescription costs than those who had DSME ($4,398.19 vs. $3,966.82, P =.0134).

Therefore, this mixed-methods study aimed to quantify 24-hour mobility levels in acutely admitted older adults and simultaneously explore clinical practice with regards to mobilization and mobility through an ethnographic field study. Over a 6-week period, hospital mobility was assessed in 44 geriatric patients by SENS motion During hospitalization, the patients spent most of their time (22.8 h/per day) in sedentary behavior and only 1.2 h/per day in uptime (walking and standing), including 43 min walking, and took less than 1200 steps daily. The field study revealed that most staff consider mobilization and mobility important tasks. However, mobilizing patients to a chair and performing functional level assessments are prioritized over patient mobility. Also, the patients' perceived mobility opportunities are limited by the physical environment (e.g., congested hallways) and lack of purposeful activities to engage in. This study found low levels of mobility in geriatric inpatients during hospitalization. While mobility is considered important, mobilization to a chair and functional assessments are prioritized over patient mobility, which becomes dependent on the patient's own initiative. Therefore, environmental adjustment, enhanced interprofessional collaboration, and targeted strategies for integrating mobility into daily care practices are warranted to enhance in-hospital mobility.

This mixed-methods cohort study comprised a retrospective analysis of ultrasound based breast screening data collected from Boluo (site A), Lilin (site B), and Ordos (site C) in China from 2018 to 2021, and qualitative, semistructured interviews conducted with program leaders from the three local Maternal and Child Health (MCH) hospitals, respectively. According to the screening protocol, we assessed the follow-up of two screening results: (1) mammography after suspicious results in the ultrasound and (2) biopsy after positive results in the ultrasound or supplement mammography. The rates and timeliness of follow-up with diagnostic examinations were compared across the different sites and procedures, and logistic regression was employed to explore the women-level factors influencing failure or delay in follow-up. Of 7,939 women with abnormal screening results, 5,943 (74.86%) received final diagnostic tests, while 4,631 (58.33%) got final diagnosis timely. The follow-up rate for mammography was higher than that for biopsy.

Chinese treatment coverage remains low, and the full economic implications of achieving these goals are not well understood. This study aims to evaluate the macroeconomic burden of HCV from 2023 to 2050, as well as the investments required, health benefits, cost-effectiveness, net economic benefit, and the impact on economic growth associated with achieving WHO hepatitis C intervention coverage targets more rapidly during this period. A dynamic compartmental model was used to simulate the transmission, progression, and cascade of care for HCV patients in China. Intervention costs and healthcare costs were calculated using the cost-of-illness (COI) method. A health-augmented macroeconomic model projected macroeconomic outcomes. Scenarios were developed to evaluate different time points for achieving coverage targets. The projected macroeconomic burden of HCV from 2023 to 2050 is $1.17 trillion. Achieving WHO targets by 2030 is expected to spend $69.72 (95% UI $66.22-$73.68) billion but will avert 0.66(95% UI 0.58-0.74) million hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cases, and 1.10(95% UI 1.03-1.18) million HCV-related deaths compared to status quo. Faster achievement of coverage targets is associated with investments becoming cost-effective sooner and facilitating greater economic growth. Achieving the WHO Global Health Sector Strategy diagnosis and treatment coverage targets by 2030 in China is projected to be cost-effective and result in significant health and economic benefits. The findings underscore the importance of increased investment in hepatitis C elimination efforts in China.",,,zhanglingli@scu.edu.cn.

A critical area of cancer research is organizing patient cohorts into subtypes and associating subtypes with clinical and biological outcomes for more effective prognosis and treatment. Large-scale studies have collected a plethora of omics data across multiple tumor types, providing an extensive dataset for stratifying patient cohorts. Network-based stratification (NBS) approaches have been presented to classify cancer tumors using somatic mutation data. A challenge in cancer stratification is integrating omics data to yield clinically meaningful subtypes. In this study, we investigate a novel approach to the NBS framework by integrating somatic mutation data with RNA sequencing data and investigating the effectiveness of integrated NBS on three cancers: ovarian, bladder, and uterine cancer. We show that integrated NBS subtypes are more significantly associated with overall survival or histology. Specifically, we observe that integrated NBS subtypes for ovarian and bladder cancer were more significantly associated with patient survival than single-data type NBS subtypes, even when accounting for covariates. In addition, we show that integrated NBS subtypes for bladder and uterine are more significantly associated with tumor histology than single-data type NBS subtypes. Integrated NBS networks also reveal highly influential genes that span across multiple integrated NBS subtypes and subtype-specific genes. Pathway enrichment analysis of integrated NBS subtypes reveal overarching biological differences between subtypes. These genes and pathways are involved in a heterogeneous set of cell functions, including ubiquitin homeostasis, p53 regulation, cytokine and chemokine signaling, and cell proliferation, emphasizing the importance of identifying not only cancer-specific gene drivers but also subtype-specific tumor drivers. Our study highlights the significance of integrating multi-omics data within the NBS framework to enhance cancer subtyping, specifically its utility in offering profound implications for personalized prognosis and treatment strategies. These insights contribute to the ongoing advancement of computational subtyping methods to uncover more targeted and effective therapeutic treatments while facilitating the discovery of cancer driver genes.",,,jzwang@northwestern.edu.

While multi-node inhibition approaches have shown promising clinical efficacy, they require further mechanistic characterisation. Using models of endometrial and breast cancer, we evaluated the efficacy of a multi-node PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway inhibitor approach utilising the dual mTORC1/mTORC2 inhibitor sapanisertib, PI3Kα inhibitor serabelisib and an insulin-supressing diet. Pathway signalling inhibition versus a range of single-node inhibitors was measured via S6, AKT and 4E-BP1 phosphorylation. The serabelisib-sapanisertib combination more effectively suppressed PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway signalling, particularly 4E-BP1, than single-node inhibitors, including alpelisib, capivasertib, inavolisib, everolimus and mutant-specific PI3K inhibitors RLY-2608 and STX-478. Serabelisib plus sapanisertib combined effectively with a range of other therapeutics, such as chemotherapies, hormone targeted therapies and CDK4/6 inhibitors. In xenograft models, sapanisertib, serabelisib plus paclitaxel/insulin supressing diet achieved complete inhibition of tumour growth/tumour regression.

Nurse reviewers assessed the presence of 17 clinical conditions using a consistent protocol. The reviews were linked with administrative data using unique patient identifiers. We compared the accuracy in coding comorbidity by ICD-10, using chart review data as the reference standard. Our findings showed that the mean difference in prevalence between chart reviews and ICD-10 for these 17 conditions was 2.1% in 2003, 7.6% in 2015 and 6.3% in 2022. Some conditions were relatively stable, such as diabetes (1.9%, 2.1% and 1.1%) and metastatic cancer (0.3%, 1.1% and 0.4%). For these 17 conditions, the sensitivity ranged from 39.6-85.1% in 2003, 1.3%-85.2% in 2015 and 3.0-89.7% in 2022. The C-statistics for predicting in-hospital mortality using comorbidities by ICD-10 were 0.84 in 2003, 0.81 in 2015 and 0.78 in 2022. The undercoding could be primarily due to the increase in hospital patient volumes and the limited time allocated to coding specialists. There is the potential to develop artificial intelligence methods based on electronic health records to support coding practices and improve data quality.

We partnered with a local advocacy organization, the Triad of North Carolina chapter of The Period Project, to create packets containing menstrual hygiene supplies. Those with positive screens were given the option of receiving a menstrual supply packet at the time of visit. Narrative feedback was obtained to evaluate for project feasibility and acceptability from AYA participants who screened positive for menstrual poverty and from clinic staff participating in screening or providing menstrual supply packets. Themes included (1) menstrual poverty as a problem in the community, (2) necessity of addressing and normalizing menstrual poverty at every AYA well visit, (3) medical and mental health consequences of menstrual poverty, and (4) suggestions to improve the clinical-community program.

CapU4 is a randomised controlled trial with two experimental arms (mailing either a urine self-sampling (USS) or VSS kit) and a control arm (mailing of a conventional invitation letter). The trial invited 15,000 women aged 30-65, who had no screening test recorded since more than four years and who did not respond to an invitation letter within 12 months before. Half of the women in each arm were randomly selected to receive a supplementary questionnaire (sent in March 2023, with responses collected until August 2023). In total, 682 completed questionnaires were analysed (9.1 % response rate). Most women found self-sampling instructions clear (VSS 87.4 %, USS 90.7 %) and procedures easy (VSS 85.9 %, USS 90.3 %). About 23.5 % of VSS users and 4.9 % of USS users found the process unpleasant. Around 80 % of participants in both SS arms preferred taking a specimen at home rather than going to a health care professional for cervical screening. They also indicated a preference for using self-sampling kit to collect a sample for their next CC screening instead of visiting a health care professional (VSS 82.6 %, USS 89.1 %). Self-sampling appears to be a well-received alternative in women not attending routine CC screening programme.",Noyelle J,CHU Angers,helene.depauw@sciensano.be.
40359642,Preserving Trial Endpoint Specificity and Cause of Death Attribution in Cardiovascular Trials: Insights From MARINER.,,JACC. Advances,10.1016/j.jacadv.2025.101763,"The MARINER (Medically Ill Patient Assessment of Rivaroxaban vs Placebo in Reducing Post-Discharge Venous Thrombo-Embolism Risk) trial examined the efficacy of rivaroxaban on venous thromboembolism (VTE) following discharge in high-risk medical inpatients. The trial did not meet its primary endpoint, in part due to a lesser effect of rivaroxaban on ""VTE-related death"" than on nonfatal VTE. The objective of this exploratory research was to examine the impact of more specific fatal VTE definitions on trial outcome HRs through readjudication of death endpoints. Primary source documents for the 241 deaths in the MARINER trial were reviewed by blinded adjudicators not involved with the original trial. Prespecified definitions for VTE-related death were used, and ""Death of Unknown Etiology"" was allowed instead of the original endpoint ""Cannot rule out pulmonary embolism."" Original event determinations for nonfatal events were used in this analysis. HRs and 95% CIs for rivaroxaban vs placebo were calculated for prespecified cardiovascular outcome composites. Rereviewed death cases showed strong concordance with original results, except deaths originally categorized as ""Cannot rule out pulmonary embolism"" were redistributed, largely to undetermined death (60%). The readjudicated MARINER primary endpoint using only confirmed fatal VTE events revealed a HR of 0.46 (95% CI: 0.23-0.91) vs the original HR of 0.76 (95% CI: 0.52-1.1). This post-hoc, exploratory analysis of endpoint design demonstrates that designing specific trial endpoints can minimize the risk of type II error. In the trial design stage, it is important to preserve endpoint specificity to allow accurate hypothesis testing. Using standardized endpoint definitions, such as for VTE-related death, across trials can help achieve this goal.",Lu W; Albanese J; Barnathan ES,Janssen Research and Development,warren.capell@cpcmed.org.

Nonprofit hospitals can address community needs through investing in environmental improvement (EI) projects aimed at reducing harm to the community from environmental hazards. These expenditures provide a useful model for understanding how hospitals can respond to environmental influences on health, but national patterns of EI expenditures are under-researched. To assess nationwide trends in nonprofit hospital EI spending from 2010 to 2021. Observational study using Internal Revenue Service tax data. US nonprofit hospitals. We assessed associations between reported EI spending and hospital organization and community characteristics (hospital revenue (quintiles); bed size (<50, 50-199, 200-399, 400 +); participation in group reporting (yes/no); teaching affiliation (yes/no); rurality status; geographic region (Northeast, Midwest, West, and South), and county poverty (quartile). There were 36 093 nonprofit hospital-years included in our analysis. 10.4% of hospitals reported EI spending. EI spending was positively associated with higher revenue and being in the Midwest region and negatively associated with area poverty. The years 2020 and 2021 were significantly associated with a lower likelihood of spending relative to 2010. 40% of hospitals included utilized group reporting. Only 6% of independently reporting hospitals reported EI spending. Among hospital organizations with any reported community-building expenses, the percentage of their total operating budget dedicated to EI averaged 0.002% each year (0%-1.52%). Though EI investments are small relative to community-building spending, the characteristics of hospitals reporting these investments provide insight into EI trends over time and which hospitals are conducting these efforts. Future research should consider the specific gaps to stimulating EI, what environmental needs hospitals are equipped to fill, and their relevance to broader environmental health policies and initiatives.",Chen K; Chen C; Fenstemaker C; Cerceo E,,
40359508,Barriers and Enablers to Using a Mobile App-Based Clinical Decision Support System in Managing Perioperative Adverse Events Among Anesthesia Providers: Cross-Sectional Survey in China.,2025-05-13,Journal of medical Internet research,10.2196/60304,"Perioperative adverse events (PAEs) pose a substantial global health burden, contributing to elevated morbidity, mortality, and health care expenditures. The adoption of clinical decision support systems (CDSS), particularly mobile-based solutions, offers a promising avenue to address these challenges. However, successful implementation hinges on understanding anesthesia providers' knowledge, attitudes, and willingness to embrace such technologies. This study aimed to evaluate the knowledge, attitudes, and willingness of Chinese anesthesia professionals to adopt a mobile CDSS for PAE management, and to identify key factors influencing its implementation. A nationwide cross-sectional survey was conducted among anesthesia providers in China from September 5 to December 31, 2023. Participants included anesthesiologists and nurse anesthetists, who play pivotal roles in perioperative care. A 51-item questionnaire, structured around the Knowledge-Attitude-Practice (KAP) framework, was distributed via WeChat through professional anesthesia associations. The questionnaire covered four domains: (1) demographic characteristics, (2) knowledge assessment, (3) attitude evaluation, and (4) practice willingness. Multivariable regression analyses identified predictors of KAP outcomes, with sensitivity analyses focusing on nurse anesthetists. The study included 2440 anesthesia professionals (2226 anesthesiologists and 214 nurse anesthetists). Overall, 87.3% (2130/2440) expressed willingness to adopt the CDSS, with 87.5% (1947/2226) of anesthesiologists and 85.5% (183/214) of nurse anesthetists showing readiness. However, only 39.2% (956/2440) were satisfied with existing incident management systems. Key findings indicated that higher knowledge scores were associated with female gender (coefficient=0.19, P=.003), advanced education, and lack of previous informatics experience (coefficient=0.29, P<.001). Nurse anesthetists scored lower than anesthesiologists (coefficient=-0.76, P<.001). Negative attitudes were more prevalent among older practitioners (coefficient=-0.13, P<.001), females (coefficient=-0.66, P<.001), nurse anesthetists (coefficient=-1.12, P=.003), and those without prior PAE exposure (coefficient=-0.97, P<.001). Higher willingness was observed among practitioners in Southwest China (coefficient=0.10, P=.048), those with positive attitudes (coefficient=0.06, P<.001), and those dissatisfied (coefficient=0.32, P<.001) or neutral (coefficient=0.11, P=.02) towards existing systems. Infrequent departmental incident discussions would reduce practice willingness (coefficient=-0.08, P=.01). This national study highlights a strong readiness among Chinese anesthesia professionals to adopt mobile CDSS for PAE management. However, critical barriers, including role-specific knowledge disparities and ineffective organizational communication, must be addressed to ensure successful implementation. Collaborative efforts among local authorities, health care facilities, anesthesia departments, and technology developers are essential to design and implement tailored strategies. Key recommendations include interdisciplinary training programs to enhance nurse anesthetists' competencies, institution-level incentives to promote incident reporting, and user-centered CDSS designs that prioritize seamless integration into clinical workflows. These measures are vital for improving perioperative incident reporting systems and ultimately advancing the safety and outcomes of surgical patients.",,,

To account for copathologies and cognitive resilience that affect the penetrance of the AD cascade, AA-2024 introduced a 2-dimensional biological-clinical staging framework. We aimed to estimate the proportion of persons along the AD continuum whose biological and clinical trajectories align with the amyloid cascade. Cross-sectional data of the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohort were tested in the 4 × 4 biological/clinical staging matrix adapted from the AA-2024 criteria. Biological stages were defined by amyloid and tau-PET burden: stage A (amyloid positivity, A+), stage B (medial temporal tau, A+/T Two-hundred and fifty-six amyloid-positive individuals (mean age: 72.7 years; 51% female) from the ADNI cohort were considered. The proportion of participants compliant with the amyloid cascade was between 31% (95% CI 25%-37%) and 36% (95% CI 30%-42%) depending on the tau-PET cutoff method. The observed number of individuals compliant with the amyloid cascade was higher than in the zero-penetrance scenario but lower than in the high-penetrance distribution ( Only approximately one-third of persons with an AA-2024 diagnosis of AD complied with the predictions of the amyloid cascade hypothesis. These results suggest the heterogeneity in how clinical symptoms and pathology are coupled along the AD continuum, which has significant implications for interpreting completed antiamyloid clinical trials and designing future studies.",,,

However, for the first time, the occurrence of eating disorders is reportedly growing faster among the male population. Nevertheless, men still are more likely to stay undiagnosed. This paper bridges this gap and offers an analysis of male eating disorders (MEDs) and particularly drawing from a feminist technoscience perspective, it examines how male eating disorders are made up in clinical practices and encounters. Specifically, in this paper, I investigate the different ways by which male eating disorders emerge as a situated matter of concern and object of clinical care. In other words, I explore the 'making present' of the male and maleness in the clinical practices treating eating disorders in the Australian healthcare system. Based on the data from 25 semi-structured, qualitative interviews with clinicians, the paper draws out how care in relation to eating disorders is organised and, specifically, how the enactment of a female/male binary mobilised in clinicians' accounts of clinical practices may act to constrain care. Finally, I demonstrate how care practices could attend to male eating disorders differently in a more sensitive and intersectional way.",,,

Non-statin lipid-lowering therapies (LLTs) such as ezetimibe, proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), bempedoic acid, and inclisiran have been recommended in clinical guidelines to treat patients with ASCVD and/or high cardiovascular (CV) risk having elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) despite being treated with maximally tolerated doses (MTD) of statins. Our previously published network meta-analysis (NMA)1 was updated in this study to evaluate comparative efficacy of non-statin LLTs in reducing LDL-C among patients with ASCVD and/or high CV risk receiving MTD statins. The systematic literature review previously conducted to inform our NMA was updated through January 2023, wherein more recent clinical trials of non-statin LLTs (ORION-15, ORION-18, HUA TUO) and additional data on monthly dosing regimens for PCSK9 mAbs were included. The outcome of interest was percentage change in LDL-C at week 24. Random-effects Bayesian NMA was performed. Comparative efficacy was estimated as mean difference (MD) with 95% credible interval (CrI). A total of 20 trials were deemed relevant for the NMA.

To test the benefits of the ICCT in improving youth functioning compared with TAU, to assess youths' general psychopathology symptoms and substance use problems, and to quantify health service access, use, and satisfaction. This 2-group pragmatic randomized clinical trial enrolled youths (14-17 years) and caregivers in Canada from September 2016 to March 2020. Participants were randomized to either 1 of 5 outpatient mental health hospital programs or 1 of 3 community ICCTs. Data analyses began on July 12, 2021, and concluded on November 12, 2023. Youths were offered services in the ICCT or TAU groups. Outcomes were assessed at baseline, 6 months, and 12 months. The primary outcome was change in youth-reported mental health functioning as measured with the Columbia Impairment Scale (CIS). Secondary outcomes included the following: (1) caregiver-reported functioning and youth- and caregiver-reported general psychopathology and substance use, (2) mental health service satisfaction, and (3) health service access and use. Linear mixed-effects and generalized estimating equation models were used to compare outcomes in intention-to-treat analyses. This study included 247 youths; 124 were randomized to the ICCT and 123 were randomized to TAU. There were no baseline differences between groups; youths had a mean (SD) age of 15.7 (1.1) years. A total of 85 (34.4%) youths identified as boys or men, 157 (63.6%) identified as girls or women, and 5 (2.0%) identified as transgender, reported diverse gender identities, or were missing these data. CIS scores improved over the 12 months for both the ICCT group (Cohen d = -3.59 [95% CI, -4.99 to -2.20]; P < .001) and the TAU group (Cohen d = -2.59 [95% CI, -4.01 to -1.18]; P < .001). Significant differences in changes between groups were not observed (unadjusted CIS model, partial η2 = 0.002; P = .59). Both groups had mean scores suggesting satisfaction with services. The ICCT group accessed services sooner (median, 9 days; IQR, 5-16 days) compared with the TAU group (median, 27 days; IQR, 14-57 days) (Cohen d = 0.54 [95% CI, 0.27-0.81]; P < .001, t test). Fewer youths in the ICCT group saw a psychiatrist compared with youths in the TAU group (22 [17.5%] vs 104 [82.5%]; P < .001, χ2 test; φ = -0.67). Although no clinical differences between groups were observed in this trial, youths receiving ICCT care improved in multiple metrics, accessed services sooner, and used fewer psychiatric resources than those in TAU programs.

Continuity and coordination of care between fracture liaison services (FLS) and primary care is required for optimal long-term osteoporosis care. This study aims to explore (1) how patients and healthcare providers (HCPs) experience the FLS to primary care transition, (2) the barriers and facilitators to primary care follow-up after FLS, and (3) interventions that enhance integration of FLS with primary care. An integrative review was performed and reported in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta Analysis (PRISMA) Statement 2020. Online bibliographic databases were searched using the terms ""osteoporosis"", ""primary care"", and ""fracture liaison services"" and related terms for original English-language studies conducted between January 1, 2003 and December 29, 2023. Manuscripts were assessed for relevance using pre-defined criteria, and for quality and bias using validated instruments. Thematic analysis was used to extract key themes relevant to each research question. Overall, 14 relevant manuscripts were identified. Among the four studies that addressed patient and HCP experience of the FLS-to-primary care transition, five key themes emerged: (1) time and workload pressures, (2) limited confidence in primary care follow-up, (3) GP knowledge gaps, (4) siloed or disconnected care, and (5) communication issues. Twelve studies addressed barriers and facilitators to primary care follow-up after FLS, which fell into five themes: (1) patient knowledge and understanding (2) miscommunication and misinformation, (3) understanding roles and responsibilities, (4) GP engagement, and (5) GP-patient relationship. Additionally, single studies suggested healthcare policies and funding, accessing primary care from residential facilities, and GP gender influenced primary care follow-up. Five studies detailed interventions to enhance FLS-to-primary care integration. GP education and patient reminders, delivered as part of a multifaceted intervention, appeared to improve integration of acute and primary post-fracture care; however, the contribution of these individual interventions to outcomes remains unclear. While telephone coaching and bone marker monitoring were identified as potential interventions, there was insufficient evidence to conclude they are effective. Available evidence was generally low-to-moderate quality with moderate-to-high risk of bias. Integration of the available evidence portrays the FLS-to-primary care transition as a challenging time for patients, GPs, and FLS clinicians, who experience a multitude of barriers to care continuation and coordination. There is insufficient data to support any single intervention as effective for enhancing care coordination beyond those considered standard components of FLS models. Knowledge gaps exist regarding the patient experience of the FLS-to-primary care transition, facilitators to primary care follow-up, interventions to support FLS integration with primary care, and how such information may be integrated to optimise care for patients with osteoporosis.",,,michael.j.bennett@unsw.edu.au.

Current intervention strategies demonstrate limited efficacy, particularly in resource-constrained settings, while policy approaches show mixed results across economic contexts. Financial toxicity operates through four identified pathways: direct expenses, indirect costs (productivity/caregiver burden), insurance coverage limitations, and structural access barriers. Research priorities include developing validated measurement instruments for diabetes financial toxicity, implementing contextually appropriate interventions, and establishing causative relationships between financial burden and clinical outcomes through longitudinal studies.",,,minalrp@umich.edu.

This study aimed to assess the impact of creatinine clearance (Ccr) on non-hematologic toxicities, including nausea and vomiting, in patients with mCRC treated with TAS-102. This study was conducted as a post-hoc analysis of the JASCC-CINV2001 study, a multicenter observational study of mCRC patients. Using a Cox proportional hazards model, we assessed the relationship between Ccr and nausea or vomiting, and used a generalized estimating equations (GEE) logistic regression model to analyze the association between Ccr and additional toxicities, including fatigue, constipation, diarrhea, insomnia, and dysgeusia. Toxicities were evaluated at weekly intervals over four weeks. Among 100 patients, median Ccr was 80.5 ml/min. The primary analysis showed no significant association between Ccr and nausea or vomiting. However, the secondary analysis revealed a significant link between lower Ccr and the incidence of diarrhea (P = 0.02). These results suggest that although TAS-102-induced nausea and vomiting are not strongly influenced by renal function, decreased renal function increases the risk of diarrhea. Enhanced antiemetic measures may not be necessary for TAS-102 patients with impaired renal function, but monitoring for diarrhea is recommended.",,,iihara.hirotoshi.p7@f.gifu-u.ac.jp.

Therefore, we aimed to compare the risks of epiphora, cystoid macular edema, and optic neuropathy between DTX- and PTX-based chemotherapy regimens. Using a nationwide claims database in Japan, we identified 6038 patients who initiated neoadjuvant or adjuvant taxane-based chemotherapy for breast cancer between April 2014 and November 2022. Data analysis was conducted in 2024. This study was conducted across multiple referral centers and community hospitals in Japan, providing a comprehensive view of taxane-based chemotherapy practices in diverse healthcare settings. Participants included 6038 patients diagnosed with breast cancer who initiated neoadjuvant or adjuvant taxane-based chemotherapy. Eligibility criteria included female patients aged 18 years or older. Participants were selected from a nationwide claims database using a consecutive sampling method. Patients who received DTX-based chemotherapy (DTX group) were compared with those who received PTX-based chemotherapy (PTX group). After adjusting for potential confounders using a propensity score-overlap weighting method, we estimated the incidence of the three ocular adverse events and hazard ratios (HRs) using Cox proportional hazards regression models. Among the 6038 eligible patients, 3829 were in the DTX group and 2209 in the PTX group. The adjusted HR for epiphora in the DTX group was 1.69 [95% confidence interval (CI), 1.17 to 2.45] compared with the PTX group. For cystoid macular edema and optic neuropathy, the adjusted HRs were 0.74 (95% CI, 0.52 to 1.04) and 0.72 (0.47 to 1.11), respectively. The composite incidence of epiphora, cystoid macular edema, and optic neuropathy did not differ significantly between the DTX and PTX groups. Among patients receiving taxane-based chemotherapy for breast cancer, DTX was associated with a higher risk of epiphora compared with PTX. However, the incidence rates of cystoid macular edema and optic neuropathy did not differ significantly between the two groups. These findings offer valuable insights into the ocular adverse event profile of taxane-based chemotherapy in patients with breast cancer.",,,chika888i@m.u-tokyo.ac.jp.

This analysis focuses on the clinical consequences for Medicare beneficiaries with chronic or hard-to-heal lower extremity diabetic ulcers (LEDUs) and venous leg ulcers (VLUs). Additionally, it aims to assess the economic implications of implementing a capitated or fixed-fee schedule on CAMPs' use, Medicare expenditures and associated medical outcomes. A review of retrospective analyses of Medicare claims (2015-2020) was conducted, comparing treatment outcomes for LEDUs and VLUs using CAMPs plus medically accepted standard of care (SoC) versus SoC without CAMPs. Clinical endpoints included rates of hard- to-heal ulcer healing, amputation rates, hospitalisations and healthcare resource use. Cost-effectiveness models evaluated the impact of CAMP reimbursement structures on overall Medicare costs. Analysing the impact of a fixed-fee schedule involved evaluating Medicare claims data from 2016-2023 to determine the number of commercially available CAMPs, along with the most up-to-date average sales price (ASP). A comparative cost analysis model using an activity-based costing approach and a prospective payment system comparison was applied to evaluate two distinct reimbursement structures: an ASP fee-for- service model versus a fixed-fee schedule model. Medicare beneficiaries receiving SoC plus CAMPs for stalled wounds demonstrated significantly lower amputation rates, reduced hospitalisations and improved wound healing times compared with those receiving SoC without a CAMP during the episode of care. Beneficiaries receiving CAMPs also realised annual cost savings of $3670 USD per patient and a five-year net benefit of $5003 USD per patient. When evaluating over a 12-month window, restricting CAMPs to eight applications in the treatment of hard-to-heal VLUs and LEDUs resulted in estimated treatment failure rates of 10.9% and >30%, depending on the area of investigation. Moreover, the non-real-world restriction of a 16-week treatment episode in the future effective CAMP LCD, which fails to account for care delays (e.g., cellulitis, hospital admissions), will likely drive treatment failure rates even higher. Among failed LEDU cases receiving a CAMP, 1% require an amputation at a reimbursement rate of $23,435 USD per case, 37% are readmitted at a rate of $2079 USD per admission, and 30% seek emergency care at a reimbursement rate of $8292 USD per visit. These complications could result in hundreds of millions of dollars in additional annual Medicare expenditures, eroding any expected savings from the future effective CAMP LCD. Implementing a fixed CAMPs fee schedule instead of the traditional ASP reporting system could potentially reduce Medicare expenditures on CAMPs by >51% while still enabling wound care providers to determine medical necessity on evidence-based decision-making. The proposed CAMPs LCD could negatively impact outcomes for Medicare beneficiaries who experience adverse outcomes when treatment is prematurely limited to eight applications over a fixed 16-week episode of care. While this subset of patients represents a relatively small proportion, they are at high risk of costly complications, which are likely to escalate when effective and medically necessary CAMPs treatment, ordered, selected and applied by their healthcare provider, is denied. Implementing a fixed-fee schedule for CAMPs without an absolute eight-application cap could enhance access by allowing healthcare providers to treat a greater proportion of hard-to-heal ulcers to closure with the goal of limb preservation, while maintaining cost controls. Policy adjustments should incorporate real-world evidence demonstrating the effectiveness of CAMPs rather than relying solely on randomised controlled trials.",Tettelbach W; Armstrong D; Niezgoda J; Wahab N; Cole W; Tucker T; Kelso MR,MD; Chief Medical Officer; MA; RN; DPM,

Adherence to study protocol and compliance with regulatory requirements was examined, based on the rate of protocol deviations. Prospective, randomised clinical trials for diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs) and venous leg ulcers (VLUs) were compared for rates/types of deviations from study protocols. Adverse events were analysed in enrolled participants. The rate and patterns of serious adverse events (SAEs) and non-serious adverse events (AEs) were compared between the two wound indications. In all, 15 trials with a total of 261 participants and 223 adverse events were included in the analysis. The DFU group was noted to have a 10.4% higher incidence of SAEs and a 7.3% higher incidence of having any AEs compared with the VLU group. Analysis showed a higher number of deviations (n=325) in VLU trials compared with DFU trials (n=128). Overall, VLUs and DFUs had rates of deviation of 1.9 and 1.4 per enrolled patient, respectively.

To assess whether infliximab is superior to placebo in reducing Modic change (MC) edema, and whether MC edema or apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values of MCs modify the effect of infliximab on disability or low back pain (LBP). In the present BackToBasic trial, infliximab did not reduce disability or LBP at 5-months follow-up in patients with chronic LBP and MC type 1. The effect on MC edema and in edema-defined subgroups is unknown. Patients with chronic LBP and type 1 MCs were randomized to receive four infliximab infusions or placebo over 98 days. MC edema was assessed using short tau inversion recovery imaging. Primary edema variables were maximum baseline edema volume (Volmax) ≥25% of vertebral body marrow (yes/no) and reduced edema at 6 months (yes/no). Maximum MC-related ADC value (0-100%) was measured at baseline. Outcomes at 5 months were the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI, 0-100, primary outcome) and LBP intensity (0-10). The analyses included logistic regression and linear mixed-effects models. 128 patients (mean age 43 years, 84 women) were included, of which78 were treated per protocol (PP).

Furthermore, specific missense mutations in the extracellular domain of the HER2 protein have been identified as oncogenic drivers in NSCLC. However, their structural properties and clinical response to HER2-targeted inhibitors remain poorly understood, warranting further investigation. R456C represents a rare exon 12 missense mutation in the HER2 extracellular domain, with limited documentation in NSCLC. This study presents an atypical case of NSCLC with a HER2 R456C mutation, where the patient experienced a favorable response and substantial survival benefit from the HER2-targeted inhibitor pyrotinib. A patient, a 65-year-old man diagnosed with stage IIIB lung adenocarcinoma, initially underwent radical concurrent chemoradiotherapy. Upon disease recurrence, polymerase chain reaction assay detected no oncogenic alterations, and programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression was negative. Chemotherapy in combination with bevacizumab resulted in stable disease, providing a progression-free survival (PFS) benefit of 6 months. However, anlotinib proved ineffective against brain metastasis, necessitating brain radiotherapy. A subsequent lung biopsy confirmed adenocarcinoma and next-generation sequencing identified a somatic HER2 exon 12 missense mutation, p.R456C. Following pyrotinib administration, the patient's pulmonary metastases significantly diminished, and the brain metastasis regressed, resulting in a partial response and a PFS benefit of 13 months. To the best of our knowledge, this study represents the first reported case demonstrating the promising efficacy of pyrotinib in HER2-altered NSCLC harboring the ra-re exon 12 R456C mutation. Heterogeneous alterations in the HER2 extracellular segment, such as R456C, may be targetable and could confer survival benefits with HER2-targeted inhibitors.",Hu J,Department of Contract Research Organization Business Unit,

Data were analysed using thematic analysis. Three high-order themes were identified: incorporating ethnicity and culture in the delivery of psychological therapies, challenges associated with delivering therapeutic interventions to women from minoritised ethnic groups and improvements to services that could support better access, engagement and outcomes for women from minoritised ethnic groups. Findings indicate that therapists viewed cultural adaptation and cultural sensitivity as important to the delivery of appropriate care for minoritised ethnic women. Challenges to appropriate care included limited service resources, communication and language barriers, stigma and existing access and engagement inequalities.

We know that the physical behaviours the workers do at work are important for their musculoskeletal health and sick leave. However, we lack knowledge of which workplace factors determine the physical behaviours of workers. Therefore, we aimed to investigate which organisational levels and factors of Danish day nurseries determine the physical behaviours at work of childcare workers. This cross-sectional study included 178 childcare workers from 73 teams and 16 day nurseries in Denmark. Workers were, on average, 36.5 years of age, mostly female (84%) and 57% were educated pedagogues. We measured physical behaviours (i.e. sedentary, light physical activity, and moderate-to-vigorous physical activity) during working hours using a thigh-worn accelerometer, and expressed them as isometric log-ratio coordinates for analysis according to compositional data analysis procedures. We examined 15 potential determinants of physical behaviours at work at three organisational levels: institutions (e.g. permanent-to-not-permanent staff ratio), teams (e.g. worker-to-child ratio), and workers (e.g. age, BMI, physical exertion). Variance component analysis identified the percentage contribution to the total variance of physical behaviours of each organisational level. Linear mixed models were used to investigate associations between determinants at each level and the physical behaviours. The largest contribution to the total variance in childcare workers' physical behaviours was observed at the worker level (95.5%), while team (2%) and institution (2.5%) levels contributed to only a minor extent. Two individual factors at the worker level-physical exertion (P < 0.01) and pain intensity (P = 0.01)-were significantly, but weakly associated with physical behaviours. Specifically, an increased physical exertion was associated with a 3.7% increase in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (P = 0.019) and a 6% decrease in sedentary behaviour (P = 0.009), relative to the remaining behaviours. Also, an increased pain intensity was associated with a 3.6% decrease in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (P = 0.008), relative to the remaining behaviours. No determinants at the institution and team levels were significantly associated with physical behaviours. In this study, worker level determines nearly all of the variability in physical behaviours while the institution and team levels only explain a little. That only two individual worker-level factors were weakly associated with physical behaviours indicates that other unmeasured worker-level factors are important determinants of the physical behaviours of childcare workers.",Wester CT; Brusaca LA; Kyriakidis S; Frost AD; Holtermann A; Rasmussen CDN,Ergonomics and Musculoskeletal Health,

The proposed systematic methodological review aims to evaluate the quality and consistency of sepsis guidelines to identify areas for improvement and provide actionable insights for guideline developers. This protocol outlines a systematic methodological review of sepsis CPGs published over the last two decades (2004-2025). A comprehensive search strategy will be conducted across PubMed, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library, and the official websites of professional societies to identify relevant guidelines. The inclusion criteria are CPGs targeting adult sepsis management published by recognized medical or governmental organizations with detailed methodological descriptions. We will use the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation II instrument to assess methodological quality across six domains: scope and purpose, stakeholder involvement, rigor of development, clarity of presentation, applicability, and editorial independence. Data extraction will focus on key clinical recommendations, including fluid resuscitation, antimicrobial therapy, vasopressor and inotrope use, corticosteroids, source control, blood glucose management, hemodynamic management, and mechanical ventilation management. The consistency of the recommendations will be analyzed, and trends in guideline quality over time will be evaluated. Artificial intelligence (AI) tools will be evaluated for data extraction processes in systematic reviews to determine their capacity for efficiency and accuracy in extracting data compared to human-driven methods.

40357485,An integrated neurophenomenological framework for naturalistic assessment of work-related stressors in healthcare professionals: a pilot study in neuro-surgery.,,Frontiers in psychology,10.3389/fpsyg.2025.1568430,"Work-related stress and burnout are pervasive challenges in healthcare, particularly in high-stakes specialties like neurosurgery. Neurosurgeons face unique demands, including prolonged cognitive and physical strain, emotionally charged patient interactions, and ethical dilemmas. These stressors significantly impact individual wellbeing, patient safety, and organizational efficiency. However, traditional stress assessment methods, such as self-reports and retrospective surveys, fail to capture the dynamic and context-specific nature of stress in real-world clinical environments. This paper introduces an integrated neurophenomenological framework for assessing stress in neurosurgeons, combining continuous physiological monitoring with real-time phenomenological assessments using experience sampling methods (ESM). Wearable devices enable the collection of granular physiological data-heart rate, heart rate variability, electrodermal activity, and skin temperature-while ESM provides real-time subjective insights, reducing recall biases. Synchronizing these data streams offers a holistic understanding of stress dynamics. A pilot study is introduced to discuss the feasibility of this approach. Participants engaged in ward-based and surgical tasks while their physiological data were continuously recorded. Structured interviews and psychometric tools complemented these measures, revealing context-specific stress responses: higher electrodermal activity during emotionally demanding ward shifts and elevated heart rate during physically intense surgical procedures. Discrepancies between physiological activation and subjective stress perception highlighted the importance of interoceptive awareness in modulating stress responses. This framework offers a replicable model for advancing stress research in healthcare. By integrating physiological and phenomenological data, it provides actionable insights into stress dynamics, paving the way for targeted interventions to enhance resilience and optimize patient care.",Pellencin E; Perin A,Department of Neurosurgery,

Taking beta-blockers (β) as an example demonstrates the complete process of ontology to knowledge graph construction and application, encompassing 41 AMTs, 1,197 entity nodes, and 1,351 relationships. The EKG-CMG can complete knowledge retrieval and discovery linked to ""one drug for multiple uses,"" ""combination therapy,"" and ""precision medication."" Additionally, we analyzed the knowledge reasoning case of cross-symptoms and complex medication for complications. The EKG-CMG systematically organizes CMK, effectively addressing the ""knowledge island"" issues between diseases and drugs. Knowledge potential relationships have been exposed by leveraging EKG-CMG visualization technology, which can facilitate medication semantic retrieval and the exploration and reasoning of complex knowledge relationships.",,,

While research regarding the implementation and outcomes of career ladders exists in multiple healthcare, private industry, and higher education contexts, there is no research pertaining directly to Veterinary Technicians within a revenue-generating organization affiliated with an institution of higher education, limiting the ability to address veterinary technician retention. Framed using Kahn's theory of employee engagement, the study involved semi-structured interviews of 17 veterinary technicians to ascertain contributors and barriers to employee engagement through a structured career ladder program for promotion. The study found that value and communication, patient care and teaching, and professional growth and development all contributed to engagement. In addition, organizational structure and perspective (goals, strategies and approach), as well as lack of support, were the key barriers to employee engagement. Key recommendations from the study are building robust advancement programs, adopting a meaningful approach to communication, consider staffing and workload needs, and directly address issues of climate and culture within the organization.",,,

An electronic database search was conducted using search terms based on the inclusion criteria, and the search strategy was peer-reviewed by a team of information scientists. Thirty qualitative studies were sampled after eligibility screening independently by two review authors. Synthesis was performed using the thematic synthesis approach. The confidence in each review finding was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations; Confidence in the Evidence from Reviews of Qualitative Research (GRADE-CERQual) approach. Fifteen analytical themes were identified. Health and care workers valued the use of PPE in patient care. The sense of value was heightened by perceived susceptibility to infection with COVID-19, the need to deliver optimal patient care and the desire to protect family members. Service delivery, clinical workflows, the absence of visual cues for spatial separation and physical infrastructure hindered adherence to physical distancing guidelines. The gap between IPC guidelines and their implementation is an important health system barrier to PPE use and physical distancing in healthcare settings.

The DNA transposon system represents a non-viral approach to CAR T-cell generation, offering several advantages including low immunogenicity, scalability, and cost-effectiveness over existing methods. Despite significant clinical advances, no meta-analysis has been conducted to evaluate the safety and efficacy of DNA transposon-generated CAR T-cells. This meta-analysis aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of DNA transposon-generated CAR T-cell therapy across B-cell malignancies. A systematic literature search was conducted through databases, PubMed, Google Scholar, OpenAlex, and Semantic Scholar, from 2012 to January 2024. A total of seven studies encompassing 110 patients were found eligible. The pooled analysis demonstrated an overall response rate of 75%, with a complete response achieved in 66% of patients. Moreover, 49% of patients demonstrated progression-free survival (PFS) with a median follow-up of 30 months, and 53% of patients achieved negative measurable residual disease (NMRD) remission. Notably, few patients experienced cytokine release syndrome (CRS) of grades 1-2; however, neurotoxicity was not described as a prevalent side effect.

Notwithstanding global awareness initiatives, there is a paucity of research on self-medication habits among Saudi women, especially in Madinah. Objective The study aims to assess awareness levels of self-medication during pregnancy and identify primary factors affecting knowledge among Saudi women in Madinah. Methods A cross-sectional study was performed at designated healthcare facilities in Madinah from October to December 2024. A validated questionnaire was conducted with 400 pregnant women via face-to-face interviews. We classified awareness scores as poor, moderate, or good and conducted statistical analysis using IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, Version 26 (Released 2019; IBM Corp., Armonk, New York, United States). Results Among the 400 participants, 194 (48.5%) were aged between 31 and 40 years, and 182 (45.5%) held bachelor's degrees. The most used over-the-counter (OTC) medications were analgesics/antipyretics (369, 92.4%) and folic acid (394, 98.5%). Only 50 (37.5%) demonstrated good awareness of self-medication risks. Higher education (p = 0.001), employment (p = 0.028), and higher income (p < 0.001) were significantly associated with increased awareness. Conclusion Although the majority of pregnant women had a moderate understanding of self-medication hazards, targeted educational initiatives are essential, especially for individuals with lower socioeconomic levels. Enhancing public health policies and awareness initiatives can mitigate the hazards associated with self-medication during pregnancy.",,,
40357102,"Validation of the Patient-Reported Outcome Measures Tool ""Catquest"" in Odia Language.",,Cureus,10.7759/cureus.82071,"Healthcare is evolving to consider patient satisfaction along with any procedure's objective outcome. After cataract surgery, the quality of vision can be assessed by administering questionnaires on daily activities. Using such questionnaires in local languages enhances patient-doctor interaction. In this study, we aim to determine whether using a Catquest questionnaire in Odia can help better assess the quality of life in the setting of a tertiary care center in Eastern India. This study aims to validate the use of a Catquest questionnaire among Eastern India's Odia-speaking population. We conducted a prospective study on 40 patients planning to undergo cataract surgery in a tertiary care center in Eastern India. We collected demographic data and conducted a comprehensive ocular examination, including slit lamp examination, fundus examination, and intraocular pressure (IOP) measurement. We asked patients to complete a Catquest questionnaire before and six weeks after surgery. We translated the English version of the questionnaire into Odia and validated it for use in the study. Patients completed both Odia and English questionnaires on both occasions. We conducted a statistical analysis to check for agreement between the answers in both languages and to validate the questionnaire in Odia. First translation and back-translation were done in English and Odia. We prepared a final draft of the questionnaire in Odia. We determined intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) values and compared the reliability of the responses of the same group of patients before and after surgery. We explored variability between answers in both languages. The data were categorical. ICC values for various activities such as reading papers, seeing to walk on uneven ground, watching television, and preferred hobbies showed perfect reliability, with ICC = 1 both preop and postop. This indicated consistent perceptions of these activities across the two time points. Activities such as seeing prices, seeing to do needlework, reading newspapers, and shopping also showed good reliability. For reading text on television, the ICC values were -0.0588 preop. However, postop, all patients were able to watch television comfortably. Thus, there was no variability between the answers. Negative ICC preop indicated very poor reliability or inconsistency preop, which we corrected postop. With the growing emphasis on patient-reported outcomes, both clinical and subjective parameters need to be considered for any procedure's success. In our clinical setting, the use of the Catquest questionnaire for assessing patient-reported outcomes in their day-to-day activities was beneficial. The translated version was reliable and well-applicable in the setting of the present study. As the study shows a good correlation between the original and translated versions, we can conclude that it can be incorporated in clinical practice successfully.",Ak K,Public Health,
40357098,Barriers and Enablers to the Implementation of Patient-Reported Outcome Measures Within Cardiff and Vale University Health Board: A Qualitative Study of Healthcare Professionals' Perspectives.,,Cureus,10.7759/cureus.82127,"Background Healthcare has experienced a shift towards outcomes-driven care. Patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) have gained popularity as a means to achieve this goal. Cardiff and Vale University Health Board (CAVHB) is one of the seven Health Boards in Wales that has implemented PROMs in clinical care. The aim of this research was to establish the barriers and enablers that occur across the different levels (micro, meso, and macro) of the Health Board from the perspective of staff engaged in implementing PROMs. The intention is that this will provide useful insights into the important factors to consider when implementing PROMs within a healthcare setting. Methodology A survey on Microsoft Forms (Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, Washington) was created and sent to healthcare professionals from various departments working with PROMs in CAVHB. Multiple open-ended questions were posed to establish macro-, meso-, and micro-level enablers and barriers in the local context. Thematic analysis was carried out to generate a number of barriers and enablers from the responses. Results Sixteen responses were generated from a mixture of departments and disciplines. Frequently reported facilitators included the presence of a specialist Value-Based Healthcare (VBHc) and PROMs team, enthusiastic and motivated clinicians, and adequate education for patients and clinicians. The responses highlighted supportive organisational leadership and the importance of adequate resourcing for implementation efforts. IT systems and digital platforms, when poorly optimised and integrated, can act as a barrier, promote clinician fatigue, and make it difficult for patients to navigate and complete PROMs. Digital illiteracy can act as a significant barrier for segments of the population. This particularly impacted the elderly, who often lacked the ability to confidently engage with digital resources. Conclusion Successful implementation of PROMs must consider a number of barriers and enablers. Education is of key importance and can help mitigate several barriers that may impact clinician and patient involvement in using PROMs. IT systems must be created in a way that links with existing record systems and does not add an additional burden to clinicians. They must be easy to navigate and use for both patients and staff. Organisational buy-in is important, and adequate resourcing and staffing can help facilitate PROMs implementation.",,,
40357089,Adhesive Strips vs. Sutures in Lumbar Spinal Fusion: A Non-inferiority Analysis of Surgical Site Infections.,,Cureus,10.7759/cureus.82065,"Introduction Surgical site infections (SSIs) continue to pose a significant challenge in spine surgery. Skin closure technique has been shown to impact SSI rates, with sutures traditionally considered the standard. Recently, alternative methods, such as adhesive strips, have gained attention for their potential advantages, including shorter operative times, fewer postoperative visits, and improved cosmetic outcomes. However, their efficacy in managing large surgical wounds, particularly in spine procedures, remains underexplored. This study compares SSI rates between sutures and adhesive strips in posterior one- and two-level lumbar spinal fusion using a non-inferiority design. Methods This single-center retrospective study evaluated SSI rates following lumbar spinal fusion using either sutures or adhesive strips for skin closure. Patients who underwent one- or two-level lumbar fusion via an open posterior approach between 2019 and 2022 were initially identified (n = 1,051). Following the application of predefined exclusion criteria, 997 patient records were eligible for review. Propensity score matching (PSM) was then employed to balance key covariates, such as age, sex, ASA classification, surgical time, use of drainage, and the number of levels fused, resulting in 608 patients evenly allocated into two groups. Data were extracted from a prospectively maintained institutional database, and SSIs were classified using the German Krankenhaus Infektions Surveillance System (KISS). A non-inferiority margin of 3% (absolute risk difference) was applied to compare SSI rates. Statistical analyses included t-tests, Mann-Whitney U tests, chi-square tests, and a Wald test for non-inferiority, with the non-inferiority established if the upper bound of the one-sided 95% confidence interval (CI) remained below the 3% margin. Results Following PSM, infection rates within a 30-day postoperative follow-up were 1.64% in the suture group and 1.97% in the adhesive strip group. A one-sided Wald test, using a 3% non-inferiority margin, yielded an absolute risk difference of 0.33% (SE = 1.1%; z = -2.47; one-sided p = 0.0067), with the upper bound of the 95% CI at 2.11%. Conclusion Adhesive strips demonstrated non-inferiority to sutures in terms of SSI rates following one- or two-level lumbar spinal fusion and may offer the added benefit of reduced operative time. However, further research is warranted to confirm these findings and support the broader implementation of adhesive strips in spinal fusion procedures.",Ochoa Estrada MC,Faculty of Nursing,
40357087,Left-Leg Apraxia and Bilateral Incoordination of the Lower Limb After Left Anterior Cerebral Artery Infarction: A Case Report.,,Cureus,10.7759/cureus.82055,"Callosal disconnection syndrome is characterized by impaired interhemispheric communication and motor coordination. Although its effects on upper limbs are well documented, reports on lower-limb function are limited, and their pathological mechanisms remain poorly understood. We describe a case involving a right-handed woman in her early 70s who presented with slurred speech and difficulty moving her feet. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed an atherothrombotic cerebral infarction affecting the splenium, body, and genu of the corpus callosum, as well as the medial region of the left frontal lobe. In addition to callosal disconnection symptoms, including impaired transfer of proprioceptive information from the fingers, left-hand apraxia, and intermanual conflict, this patient exhibited asynchrony in lower-limb movements and left lower-limb apraxia. The patient's ability to perform coordinated movements improved with repeated rehabilitation sessions. These findings suggest that corpus callosum injury plays a pivotal role in bilateral lower-limb coordination and motor control. We emphasize the need for further research to elucidate the role of the corpus callosum in lower-limb motor control.",,,
40357080,Prevalence and Clinical Severity of Erectile Dysfunction in Patients Undergoing Coronary Angiography: A Descriptive Cross-Sectional Study at a Tertiary Hospital in Northern Sri Lanka.,,Cureus,10.7759/cureus.82125,"Erectile dysfunction (ED) is an early clinical manifestation, and it could also be the ""tip of the iceberg"" of chronic atherosclerotic disease. As the onset of ED precedes major cardiovascular events, screening for it could be a simple and cost-effective approach for preventive management in low-income countries like Sri Lanka. This study aimed to determine the prevalence and clinical severity of ED among male patients undergoing coronary angiography, to assess the association between ED severity and the extent of coronary artery disease (CAD), and to examine relevant clinical risk factors. A descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted among male patients undergoing coronary angiography at Teaching Hospital Jaffna, Sri Lanka, from July 2024 to October 2024. All eligible patients were recruited, which represents 73.9% (298) of the estimated sample. A structured interviewer-administered form was utilized to collect the data, which included a validated International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF)-5 questionnaire for assessing ED. Coronary angiography findings were used to assess the severity of CAD. IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, Version 29 (Released 2021; IBM Corp., Armonk, New York, United States) was used to analyze the data. Out of 298 male patients who underwent coronary angiography during the study period, 181 were found to have ED (60.7%; CI: 55.1-66.2). There was a statistically significant association between ED severity and CAD extent (p-value < 0.001), particularly notable in patients with multi-vessel disease. The proportion of patients with severe ED (IIEF index = 4) showed an increased number of affected coronary vessels. Among patients with triple vessel disease, 82.5% (52 out of 63) had severe ED, while in patients with single-vessel disease and normal epicardial coronary vessels, severe ED was much less prevalent (5.7% and 4.9%, respectively) (Spearman-correlation r = 0.637, p-value < 0.001). The presence of hypertension was significantly associated with ED (p-value = 0.026) as well as the duration of hypertension (p-value = 0.034) in bivariate analysis. After adjustment for potential confounders, the results showed that diagnosed CAD was associated with a 3.92 times (CI: 2.2-7.03) higher risk of having ED. This study demonstrated a strong association between ED and CAD, and it highlights that ED is an early indicator of underlying CAD. Routine screening for ED in high-risk patients, particularly those with hypertension and diabetes, can improve early detection of CAD and aid in the implementation of preventive strategies. However, the study's limitations, including its single-center design and cross-sectional nature, highlight the need for further multi-center and longitudinal research to validate these findings and explore the potential therapeutic benefits of ED management in cardiovascular disease.",Nadarajah R,Family Medicine,
40357076,Acute Angle-Closure Glaucoma as an Ocular Complication of Dengue Fever: A Comprehensive Review.,,Cureus,10.7759/cureus.82119,"Dengue fever, a rapidly spreading global epidemic, ranks among the most frequently reported viral infections worldwide, typically presenting with systemic symptoms such as fever, headache, and rash. Although generally linked to systemic issues, dengue infection can also lead to uncommon ocular complications, such as acute angle-closure glaucoma (AACG), which poses a threat to sight. This review focuses on the alterations in the anterior chamber angle and the subsequent development of glaucoma after dengue infection. Prompt and precise diagnosis, aided by essential diagnostic tools like intraocular pressure (IOP) measurement, gonioscopy, and advanced imaging methods, is essential for effective management. The initial treatment typically includes osmotic agents, carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, and topical glaucoma medications, with Nd:YAG (neodymium-doped yttrium aluminum garnet) laser iridotomy being the definitive treatment option. The review emphasizes the importance of long-term monitoring to assess ocular outcomes and prevent relapse. While AACG occurrence in dengue patients is rare, healthcare providers in endemic areas must stay alert for ocular symptoms in dengue patients presenting with vision problems. Preventing irreversible vision loss demands increased vigilance, early diagnosis, and timely treatment. Additionally, the review advocates for more clinical research and the creation of refined diagnostic protocols to tackle this rare but severe complication.",,,

Better control of hemoglobin A1C (HbA1c) levels in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) using Abbott FreeStyle Libre (Chicago, Illinois, United States) was reported. This study evaluated the glycemic outcomes in T2DM patients using Abbott FreeStyle Libre in Indian settings. In this single-center retrospective study, data was collected from T2DM patients aged ≥18 years prescribed with Abbott FreeStyle Libre at Gupta Ultrasound and Heart Care Centre, New Delhi, India. The first application was considered the first use of FreeStyle Libre. The measurements were obtained from a sensor that operated continuously for as long as 14 days. The second application meant patients were using FreeStyle Libre for the second time continuously for 14 days following a break of two weeks after the first application. Time-in-range (TIR) is the percentage of time that a person spends with their blood glucose levels in a recommended target range. Time-below-range (TBR) is the time spent with blood sugar lower than the recommended range. Time-above-range (TAR) is the time spent above the recommended range. Relationship between TIR and various demographics/CGM metrics were analyzed. Overall, 649 and 60 patients were included from the first application and the second application, respectively. The average duration of DM was 10-15 years in most patients, with hypertension being the predominant comorbidity. TIR negatively correlated with lower HbA1c (r=-0.547; p<0.001), lower average glucose (r=-0.790; p<0.001), and TAR (r=-0.951; p<0.001) and positively correlated with TBR (r=0.190; p<0.001). TAR, TBR, and HbA1c were identified as significant predictors of TIR. TIR from FreeStyle Libre showed a meaningful association with glycemic control, which could aid in optimizing treatment plans and improving clinical outcomes of T2DM patients.",Gupta V,Diabetes and Endocrinology,
40357068,Three-Dimensional (3D) Printing for Left Atrial Appendage Occlusion Device Sizing: A Systematic Review and Comparative Analysis.,,Cureus,10.7759/cureus.82043,"In recent years, the clinical application of three-dimensional (3D) printing technology has shown great potential in surgical planning. The left atrial appendage (LAA) is a key site for thrombus formation in nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF), increasing the risk of stroke. One recent application of this technology is for LAA occlusion, a procedure used to seal the LAA and prevent the formation of systemic thromboembolism associated with NVAF in patients with contraindications for oral anticoagulation therapy.  In this systematic review, the use of 3D printing for device sizing during the planning of LAA occlusion procedures was evaluated through a literature search using the following keywords: (""Left atrial appendage"" OR ""LAA"" or ""intra-atrial mass"" OR ""left atrial mass"" ) AND (""3D printing"" OR ""additive manufacturing"" OR ""rapid prototyping"" OR ""computer-aided design"" OR ""CAD"" OR ""bioprinting"") AND (""occlusion"" OR ""closure"" OR ""device sizing"" OR ""atrial fibrillation"").  After data extraction, 16 studies reported using 3D printing, prospectively or retrospectively, to estimate the accuracy of LAA device sizing and/or deployment. These studies demonstrated that 3D-printed models can improve anatomical measurements and allow for improved device sizing and implantation compared to standard-of-care imaging-assisted procedural planning.  Of the articles included in this review, two articles found a significant reduction in devices used per procedure (from 1.7 to 1.1 and 1.20 to 1.05, respectively), with shorter procedure times in the 3D-printed groups. Additionally, the 3D-printed models showed fewer devices deployed per procedure, perivascular leaks, and residual shunts. Additionally, one article found fewer perivascular leaks in the 3D group (one vs. four in controls), and one article showed no residual shunts in the 3D group compared to 14.29% in controls.  Although the 16 studies included in this review demonstrate the value of 3D printing in LAA occlusion procedures, the findings underscore the need for larger, multicenter studies to further quantify its clinical benefits, particularly in improving procedural planning and reducing complications in the intravascular treatment of LAA thrombosis in NVAF.

40357065,Physical Activity Assessment in Patients With Nephrotic Syndrome and the Impact of COVID-19: A Study Using the International Physical Activity Questionnaire and Accelerometry.,,Cureus,10.7759/cureus.82126,"Background Nephrotic syndrome (NS) typically involves proteinuria, reduced levels of albumin in the blood, and swelling. It may also lead to complications, including an increased risk of thrombosis and a decline in kidney function. While pharmacological treatments are primary, physical activity (PA) may play a role in improving outcomes. However, limited data exist on PA levels in patients with NS, particularly regarding the validity of self-reported PA assessments. The COVID-19 pandemic also introduced significant lifestyle changes, potentially impacting PA and kidney function. This study aimed to (1) compare self-reported PA using the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) with objectively measured PA via accelerometry in patients with NS and (2) evaluate changes in PA and kidney function before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods This multicenter cohort study recruited outpatients aged ≥15 years with primary NS between 2019 and 2020. Participants completed IPAQ and wore accelerometers for at least seven days. PA intensities were categorized as light PA (LPA), moderate-to-vigorous PA (MVPA), or sedentary behavior (SB). The association between IPAQ and accelerometers by activity measurement method describes the values measured for each activity intensity and shows the correlation coefficient. Kidney function was assessed using estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and urinary protein-to-creatinine ratio (UPCR). PA and kidney function were compared before (December 2019 to March 2020) and during (June to December 2020) the pandemic. Results Seventeen participants were included in the IPAQ-accelerometer comparison, and eight were analyzed for pre-pandemic versus pandemic PA changes. Across all intensity levels, IPAQ tended to underestimate PA compared to accelerometers, but this was not statistically significant (IPAQ vs. accelerometer in total PA: 56.6 vs. 652.6 min/day, p = 0.56). IPAQ showed no correlation with accelerometer-measured LPA but demonstrated a moderate correlation with MVPA. During the pandemic, MVPA decreased by 0.88% (95% CI: -5.08 to 3.33%), while SB increased by 0.59% (95% CI: -10.1% to 11.3%). Step count decreased by 810 steps/day (95% CI: -3,597 to 1,977). Kidney function remained stable, with eGFR decreasing by 4.1 mL/min/1.73 m² (p = 0.98) and UPCR increasing by 1.9 g/gCre (p = 0.17), although these changes were not statistically significant. Conclusions IPAQ underestimated PA compared to accelerometry, particularly for low-intensity activity. During the pandemic, PA decreased, while sedentary time increased, although kidney function remained stable. These findings highlight the need for objective PA measurement in patients with NS and suggest that pandemic-related lifestyle changes may have influenced PA behaviors. Further research is warranted to assess the long-term impact of PA on kidney outcomes in this population.",,,

The peripheral perfusion index (PPI), derived from pulse oximetry, quantifies peripheral perfusion but varies across fingers. A pulse oximeter probe may cause burns when worn at the same site. Therefore, changing the site has been recommended. However, changes in PPI values owing to probe replacement reduce the reliability of clinical and research applications. No two fingers with equivalent PPI values have been identified yet. This study assessed the interfinger differences in PPI by measuring the five fingers simultaneously and identified the two fingers with the least fluctuation in values.  A total of 30 healthy volunteers were included in this single-center prospective exploratory study. For PPI measurements, the pulse amplitude index (PAI) was measured using a pulse oximeter on a bedside monitor (Life Scope PT; Nihon Kohden Corp., Tokyo, Japan). The tape-type disposable pulse oximeter probes were attached to each of the five fingertips of the dominant hand, and measurements were conducted in three rooms with different temperatures (16°C, 22°C, and 28°C) to induce thermoregulatory responses and capture a wide range of PAI values. The primary endpoint was the PAI in pairs of two fingers each (a total of 10 pairs). Paired t-tests with Bonferroni correction were used to compare finger pairs, with statistical significance defined as  The combination with the least difference in PAI was the index-ring finger combination (0.07% ± 1.89%,   PPI values measured using the pulse oximeter showed the smallest interfinger difference between the index and ring fingers. If changing the finger to which the probe is attached during clinical or research use is needed, it may be possible to consistently measure the PPI values by alternately attaching the probe to the index and ring fingers.",,,

Hemodialysis remains a critical life-sustaining treatment for CKD patients, with arteriovenous fistulas (AVFs) being the most commonly used vascular access. The long-term functionality of AVFs relies heavily on patients' self-care abilities, encompassing their knowledge of maintenance practices, appropriate attitudes toward care, and the implementation of effective self-care behaviors. Consequently, accurately assessing the self-care capabilities of patients with AVFs is essential for optimizing treatment outcomes and enhancing their overall quality of life. This study aims to translate the scales of knowledge, attitude, and practice of self-care for patients with arteriovenous fistula (SKAPS-AVF) into Chinese and evaluate its psychometric properties among Chinese patients to ensure its validity and reliability in clinical and research settings. The study employed the Brislin translation model to translate and back-translate the original scale, followed by cultural adaptation to ensure its relevance to the Chinese context. Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) were conducted to assess the structural validity of the scale. Reliability was evaluated by calculating Cronbach's alpha, split-half reliability, and McDonald's Omega ( Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) revealed that the translated scale has a three-factor structure, with eigenvalues greater than 1 for all factors and a total variance explanation rate of 63.099%. Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) demonstrated good model fit, with fit indices such as the chi-square value, Comparative Fit Index (CFI), Tucker-Lewis Index (TLI), and Root Mean Square Error of Approximation (RMSEA) meeting acceptable standards. Reliability analysis indicated that Cronbach's alpha, split-half reliability, and McDonald's Omega values all exceeded 0.7, suggesting good internal consistency and stability of the scale. The C-SKAPS-AVF demonstrated good psychometric properties, with high structural validity and reliability, making it a robust tool for assessing self-care capabilities in patients with arteriovenous fistulas. This scale provides a reliable measurement tool for related clinical interventions and research. However, future studies should consider expanding the sample size and evaluating the scale's longitudinal stability and applicability across different cultural contexts.",,,

The Consortium of Rural States (CORES), comprising eight Clinical and Translational Science Award (CTSA) hubs, is a research consortium that focuses on clinical and translational research impacting rural health. Utilizing the Translational Science Benefits Model (TSBM) framework, each CTSA hub's evaluation lead co-created an inventory of rural-focused activities, projects, and initiatives that occurred at their respective site during the funding period 2021-2023. Variables included program area; activity type and description; target population; activity status; outputs; and short-term outcomes. The evaluators then mapped site outcomes according to the four TSBM domains (clinical, community, economic, policy) and 30 subcategories (benefits). 184 rural-focused activities, projects and initiatives were identified across the hubs. All rural-focused efforts involved impacts in the Community and Clinical domains of the TSBM, with >60% focusing on Community impacts. These results suggest an opportunity gap to better define Economic and Policy-level impacts in the context of rural-focused initiatives. This work demonstrates a novel mapping of the TSBM to rural health research settings and explores the nuances of using the concepts and domains of the TSBM as a coding tool. This work gives the Consortium insight on the types of projects and impacts that are supported and how to prioritize more exploration of the full range of translational science benefits in rural health initiatives going forward.",,,

MWA has emerged as a recent alternative for treating osteoid osteoma (OO), providing similar accessibility, safety, and technical effectiveness as radiofrequency ablation. This systematic review aims to evaluate the safety and efficacy of MWA in treating OO. A systematic review of published studies on the use of MWA in managing OO was conducted. Studies were excluded if they were 1) not written in English, 2) case reports, 3) lacked adequate peer review, or 4) consisted solely of abstracts. Before full-text assessment, titles, and abstracts were screened. Extracted data included author, year, study design, patient count, age, gender, OO site, ablation power (watts), duration, complications, outcome, and recurrence. The data were analyzed and presented as means, frequencies, and percentages. Eight studies, including 143 cases, met the inclusion criteria; among these cases, 59.44% were male, and the mean age was 19.03 ± 7.09. Most of the OOs were in the femur, 54.54%. MWA at 60 W was the prevailing power setting, utilized in 37 cases (25.87%), with an ablation time of 90 s for 95 cases (66.43%). Clinical success was achieved in 137 (95.80%) cases, with recurrence observed in 4 cases (2.80%). However, 16 minor and major complications were observed despite the overall success.

Using a previously published combined Markov-decision-tree model adapted for Peru, this study estimated the outcomes of different vaccination strategies targeting various age and risk groups. The model used age-specific epidemiology, clinical, cost, and quality-of-life inputs derived from the published literature and national surveillance data. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to assess uncertainty. The vaccination strategy targeting older adults aged ≥ 60 years and the high-risk population between 12 and 59 years old with a 24% vaccine uptake was estimated to prevent 78,483 symptomatic cases, 2,962 hospitalizations, 103 deaths, and 2,913 lost QALYs compared with no vaccination, translating to an incremental decrease of $12,856,654 in total direct costs and an incremental decrease of $35,090,748 in total societal costs. These gains were further increased by expanding vaccination to additional age groups and increasing vaccine uptake. Vaccination in the population aged ≥ 60 years and the high-risk population between 12 and 59 years old in Peru was projected to yield substantial health and economic benefits.

Such tools help monitor disease progression, assess treatment response, and inform clinical management. Canadian SMA clinicians participated in a Delphi process to achieve a 2021 national consensus on recommended outcomes, recognizing future reassessment would be essential given the evolving field and gaps in patient-reported and bulbar measures.ObjectiveDerive updated Canadian consensus of recommended outcome measures for adults with SMA.MethodsA national consensus workshop was held with SMA clinicians, patient/family representatives, research leaders, national registry and advocacy organizations. Clinics and registry experience and data were presented and discussed, utility of current and additional outcomes reviewed. Long and short lists of measures were generated, with voting to derive consensus.ResultsPractical implementation, value of data, and relevance to persons with SMA were key considerations. Consensus was achieved to 'think outside the box', recognizing a spectrum of function and need to choose the right outcome measure for the right patient at the right time. Measures with greater acceptance for adults were selected, and bulbar measures introduced. Eight outcome measures are recommended; 4 motor, 2 respiratory and 2 patient reported domains, with use based on the individuals level of function. The Revised Upper Limb Module was deemed to have broadest applicability except in the strongest and weakest adults. Additional measures are included as optional and exploratory.ConclusionsEmploying measures meaningful for clinicians, researchers, and persons living with SMA is essential to ensuring quality data collection and an engaged patient-centred clinical team. Clinicians should select measures based on the person's functional ability and goals.

This study aims to design and validate a knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) questionnaire to assess understanding of leprosy reactions among leprosy-affected individuals. This study employed a sequential exploratory design in three phases. During interviews, affected individuals expressed dissatisfaction with the level of information provided by medical practitioners regarding leprosy reactions. People affected by leprosy reactions shared experiences of frustration, treatment barriers, and difficulties with daily activities during interviews and workshops. The pilot test with eight affected individuals let to the removal of one question, the addition of a new question, and adjustment to wording and instructions. Cronbach's alpha was calculated based on data collected from 63 individuals. The overall Cronbach's alpha was 0.71. The final KAP questionnaire consists of 39 questions, is considered clear and acceptable by users and can therefore be used to measure the KAP of individuals with leprosy reactions in Indonesia.

Participants of five Rush Alzheimer's Disease Center (RADC) cohorts with study visits between October 2015 and December 2019 and fee-for-service Medicare contributed observations. For each observation, we compared research-based dementia status to dementia status based on six ICD-10 code definitions. A total of 1869 participants contributed 5309 observations (mean age 82.9 years, 21.0% Black, 9.3% met research-based dementia criteria). The accuracy of ICD-10 code definitions was high (87%-90%); five of six code definitions favored specificity over sensitivity. All ICD-10 code definitions were less accurate among subgroups defined by older age, minoritized race, increased depressive symptoms, and history of stroke. Performance of ICD-10 code definitions mirrored that of ICD-9 code definitions. Awareness of differential performance by participant characteristics can improve the robustness of research.

We determined public attitude toward dementia risk prediction through the means of a focus group (n = 9) and subsequent online survey (n = 687). Thematic content analysis was used for focus group data and descriptive statistics for survey responses. Focus group participants expressed reluctance in knowing dementia risk due to fear, emotional burden, and belief that prevention was impossible. Conversely, practical benefits and maximizing present quality of life motivated others to know dementia risk. Of survey respondents, 66.1% would want to know their 10-year risk at present, increasing to 82.3% if preventive medication were available. People perceived their 10-year risk as rather high, yet lower still than their own personal threshold for considering preventive action. Development and implementation of dementia risk prediction tools require attention for personal actionability and emotional impact of risk communication. Among citizens with a particular interest in dementia, a large group is keen to learn their personal dementia risk, particularly when effective preventive measures are available. In focus group participants, hesitancy to learn about dementia risk was common, driven by fear, emotional burden, and doubts about the effectiveness of preventive interventions. The majority of survey participants (72%) believed a healthy lifestyle could reduce dementia risk.

This study aimed to co-design a health education strategy to improve bowel cancer awareness/screening in remote Tasmania. A co-design method was used to conduct two group workshops with 17 participants (14 community members, three healthcare providers). Workshops were guided by previous interviews with the community. Workshop one: participants chose the top three screening barriers and designed interventions to overcome them. These interventions were collated and presented to participants in workshop two. Participants shared ideas to refine interventions, then completed an acceptability, feasibility and appropriateness questionnaire of the overall strategy. Data was collected via written notes and analysed through content analysis. A health education strategy with two components and multiple interventions was developed: local media campaign (signage, video, bookmark, flyer, poster) and community health education events. Events included community champions sharing personal stories and healthcare providers providing clinical information. Participants identified the strategy as feasible, appropriate and acceptable for a rural/remote Tasmanian community. Following workshops, strategy components were developed in collaboration with the community. Large scale strategies which may be effective for metropolitan areas of Australia may not be accepted by or appropriate for those in rural/remote areas.

The treatment gap remains high: only about 14% of individuals with problematic alcohol use access treatment. The implementation of digital interventions, addressing problematic alcohol use, into healthcare can be one way of reducing the treatment gap. However, little is known about how healthcare staff perceive the integration of digital interventions in routine addiction care. The aim of the study was to identify and describe healthcare staff's experiences of perceived benefits of digital interventions for patients with alcohol use disorders (AUD), introduced in recent years within routine specialized addiction care in Sweden. The aim was further to explore how the use of such interventions in this setting could be further developed. This study was conducted as an exploratory qualitative interview study with 16 informants from addiction care staff in Stockholm, Sweden. The informants came from three different groups: clinical managers, staff referring outpatients to digital interventions from within addiction care, and therapists from an e-support unit. The interviews were recorded, transcribed, and analyzed with thematic analysis. Three themes illustrated the benefits of digital interventions in routine addiction care, and future development areas. The theme An easy way in reflected the importance of easy access to addiction care where care would be flexible and available to everyone. Meeting individual patient needs raised the question of how to adapt treatment formats to the patients' individual needs. Smoothly interlocking organizational gears highlighted the need for structure and cooperation between digital care and in-person care. Each theme included three additional subthemes.

Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the impact of a disparity-reduction intervention on outcomes of patients with ACS in the ED. This randomized clinical trial included 264 ACS patients, randomly allocated into intervention (n = 132) and control group (n = 132). The intervention involved improving the triage process by (1) welcoming nurses and (2) conducting specialized triage. Also, a patient navigation (PN) program was implemented, comprising (1) emergency care comprehensive management, (2) supportive education and counseling, and (3) clinical actions with follow-up care. In the control group, standard triage and routine care were provided. Outcomes assessed included pain intensity, patient opinion of pain management, illness perception, threat perception, and short and long-term outcomes. The results showed that after the intervention, pain intensity and threat perception decreased significantly in the intervention group compared to the control group (P < 0.001). Moreover, the opinion of pain management-assessed only post-intervention-was significantly more favorable in the intervention group than in the control group (P < 0.001). Illness perception scores also increased more prominently in the intervention group than in the control group (P < 0.001). Short-term outcomes showed improvement in the intervention group compared to the control group (P < 0.05). Long-term outcomes revealed that the intervention group experienced better results than the control group in specialist visits, exercise stress tests, echocardiography, and readmissions (P < 0.05). Interventions such as improving the triage process and the PN are important in reducing disparities and improving patient outcomes.

This is the first study in which the validity, reliability, and sensibility of two patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) of psychological well-being, the five-item World Health Organization Well-Being Index (WHO-5) and the six-item version of the Ryff's Psychological Well-Being Scales (PWB-6), have been tested according to clinimetric criteria to determine their current and potential clinical applications in SSc patients. A cross-sectional study was conducted involving 219 patients with a diagnosis of SSc. Rasch and Mokken analyses were performed to assess the clinimetric properties of the two PROMs and determine their clinical utility. All items of WHO-5 and PWB-6 fitted the Rasch model, had an optimal scalability, and the dimensionality analyses yielded less than 5% of significant t-tests, thus indicating that the two PROMs were unidimensional measures. Person separation reliability indices revealed acceptable internal consistency and inspection of the person-item distribution map showed that WHO-5 and PWB-6 were reasonably well-targeted for use with SSc patients. Findings indicate that WHO-5 and PWB-6 are valid indices of psychological well-being that may provide unique prognostic information and help researchers and clinicians tailor personalized treatment strategies. The two PROMs can be used jointly but for different clinical purposes. WHO-5 is particularly suitable to assess the degree of subjective vitality, a positive feeling of aliveness and energy that may help SSc patients cope with their illness. The PWB-6 can be used to identify unique experiences of psychological well-being that may help SSc patients not only cope with their feelings of loneliness and uncertainty but also experience a meaningful life despite the progression of disease. In clinical research and daily practice, the baseline and follow-up use of WHO-5 and PWB-6 may thus lead to a substantial improvement in the quality of care of patients with SSc. Given the cross-sectional design of the present investigation, future prospective studies are, however, recommended to further assess the predictive validity and prognostic utility of the two PROMs.",,,danilo.carrozzino@unibo.it.

The aim of this EQA was to standardize the detection of phleboviruses in order to provide comparable data to feed mathematical models for the surveillance of the impact of climate changes and environmental parameters on the kinetics and diversity of sand fly species and on sand fly-borne microorganisms. Nine laboratories from seven countries participated in the EQA. Each laboratory was provided with eight vials, each containing an anonymous sample; two vials of lyophilized primers and probes to be used for the detection of Toscana virus (TOSV) and several Sandfly fever Sicilian virus (SFSV) species with a reverse-transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) assay; and one vial of lyophilized primers for the detection of generic phleboviruses with a RT-PCR assay along with the standard operating procedure. The laboratories were instructed to submit their results together with details on the techniques employed. All nine laboratories successfully detected the two TOSV- and the one SFSV-positive samples. Only one laboratory, using a generic phlebovirus assay, detected all of the targeted phleboviruses. All participating laboratories successfully identified the two TOSV and one SFSV using the proposed RT-qPCR assays, albeit with some variations in cycle threshold values across laboratories. The detection rate of SbPV was lower with the generic Phlebovirus assay than with the specific real-time RT-qPCR assays. This EQA aimed to assess the SbPV detection capabilities of molecular tools and strengthen their use, thereby supporting the involvement of laboratories in virus discovery and surveillance beyond their core expertise.",Ayhan N; Baronti C; Thrion L; Bongiorno G; Charrel RN; ,; Unite des Virus Emergents (UVE); Department of Infectious Diseases,nazli.ayhan@univ-amu.fr.

Palliative care (PC), seeking holistic care, becomes crucial in this context, and for its development, the World Health Organization has defined its education and teaching as one of the essential pillars. PC emphasizes patient dignity, autonomy, and holistic well-being, reflecting Thomasma and Pellegrino's beneficence-in-trust model, fostering trust and ethical care.The aim of this research was to analyze, through the bioethics perspective, the acquisition of PC competencies among medical students. This cross-sectional, quantitative study assessed 360 medical students from a public university in Paraná, using the Pallicomp tool questionnaire to evaluate PC competencies. Data were analyzed using statistical methods, comparing scores across academic cycles and prior PC coursework. Findings were interpreted through bioethical principles and Pellegrino and Thomasma's beneficence-in-trust model. Basic cycle students presented a higher overall score than those in the internship, with statistical difference, and the individual analysis of competencies did not reveal an increase throughout the course. When considering the overall score between students who took PC courses and those who did not, there was no statistically significant difference. Deficiencies were observed in key areas involving bioethical principles, including symptom management, compassionate communication, spirituality, and interdisciplinary teamwork. This study revealed gaps in PC education among medical students, with scores below 70% across academic cycles and a decline from basic to internship levels. The findings highlight deficiencies in holistic, patient-centered competencies, including psychological and spiritual care, interdisciplinary teamwork, and communication. Addressing these gaps requires integrating bioethical principles and practical training throughout medical education to foster ethical, humanized, and comprehensive care, aligning with the beneficence-in-trust model.

40355914,Entrustable professional activities for pediatric and subspecialties residency training in China.,2025-05-13,BMC medical education,10.1186/s12909-025-07231-6,"Outcome-based medical education is the latest focus in the past decade, and Entrustable Professional Activities(EPAs) have emerged as efficient vehicles to assess physicians. However, few studies have discussed the use of EPAs for residency training in pediatric medicine and its subspecialties. We conducted a pilot study to examine the feasibility of EPAs as a component of the clinical program of assessment in pediatric standardized residency training. We conducted a cross-sectional study for standardized residency training in different subspecialties within pediatric medicine at Qilu Hospital of Shandong University. Totally 65 residents and 35 directors joined in this study. An electronic EPA survey using 8 scales composed of 15 categories was distributed among residents and directors. Kruskal-Wallis test and Mann-Whitney U test were applied for comparing the self-assessments and director-assessments. Generalized estimated equation (GEE) was used to analyze the effect of postgraduate year(PGY), gender, and position on the EPA scores of director assessments. A total of 401 director-assessment and 65 residents' self-assessment ( response rate 100%) questionnaires were collected, both demonstrating rising trends in scores across PGYs. Significant differences were found between PGY1 and PGY2 (p < 0.01) and between PGY1 and PGY3 (p < 0.01), but not between PGY2 and PGY3 (p > 0.01). With an effect analysis of PGY, gender, and position on EPA scores performed, PGY had a significant effect on 13 out of 15 EPA scores, while gender affected only four EPA scores significantly, and position affected only three EPA categories. Meanwhile, some EPA categories revealed significant differences across various pediatric subspecialties (p < 0.01). The study findings suggest that EPA assessments is feasible among different PGYs in standardized Chinese residency training in pediatric medicine and its subspecialties. Postgraduate year had a significant impact on EPA scores, while gender and resident position also affected EPA scores to a certain extent. Improved stratified teaching programs are required for better subspecialty consistency.",,,zhaocuifen@sdu.edu.cn.

Each of the NCLs is a genetically distinct disease caused by variants in at least 13 different genes (CLN1-CLN14). NCLs are neurodegenerative, and symptoms can include a combination of childhood dementia, epileptic seizures, motor decline and vision loss, and eventually lead to premature death. There is currently no cure for any subtype of NCL, however, enzyme replacement therapy is available for CLN2 disease, and several treatment strategies are being explored for other NCL subtypes. Early diagnosis and initiation of supportive services (e.g. health, education, social services) are essential to preserve quality of life. Only a few studies have investigated family experiences with NCL, many of which are international in scope. A mixed-method research study was conducted in the UK to understand family experiences in CLN2 and CLN3 disease. It involved an initial literature review, followed by in-depth qualitative interviews. Interview data were analysed using a thematic analysis. Thirteen families (n = 13) participated in the interviews. This represented 16 parents (11 mothers and 5 fathers) of 18 children (10 diagnosed with CLN3 disease and 8 diagnosed with CLN2 disease). Findings were analysed jointly across CLN2 and CLN3 disease. Six overarching themes emerged from the analysis: difficulty in recognising early symptoms; the shock of a diagnosis; the demands of caring for complex and ever-changing needs; a constant battle to access appropriate and timely support services; the extensive impact on the unaffected sibling; and the all-encompassing impact on the family. This study contributes novel UK specific data on family experiences and unmet needs in CLN2 and CLN3 disease. More needs to be done to ensure NCLs are diagnosed early, and timely local support services are made available to protect quality of life for both the affected children and their families.",Nordstrom S; Wait S; Brownnutt L; Cole B; Kenrick S; Sisic Z; Thompson B; Nightingale J,The Health Policy Partnership; The Batten Disease Family Association (BDFA),Shannon.boldon@hpolicy.com.

While supervisor knowledge-sharing behavior has been identified as a potential innovation driver, the mechanisms influencing nurses' innovative behaviors remain unclear. To investigate the mediating role of organizational learning in the relationship between supervisors' knowledge sharing behavior and nurses' innovative behaviors in clinical settings. A cross-sectional study was conducted among 450 nurses from university hospitals of Ardabil University of Medical Sciences, Iran, between September and November 2024. Data were collected using the Supervisor Knowledge Sharing Behavior Questionnaire (SKSBQ), Innovative Behavior Inventory (IBI), and Organizational Learning Instrument-Development Stages (OLI-DS). Structural equation modeling (SEM) analyses were performed to test the hypothesized relationships. Findings revealed significant positive correlations between supervisor knowledge sharing behavior, organizational learning, and innovative behaviors. SEM results confirmed that organizational learning partially mediated the relationship between supervisor knowledge sharing behavior and nurses' innovative behaviors. The findings highlight the crucial role of supervisor knowledge sharing behavior in fostering nurses' innovative behaviors directly and through the mediating effect of organizational learning. Healthcare organizations should prioritize developing supervisors' knowledge sharing capabilities and establishing robust organizational learning cultures to enhance innovation among nursing staff.

This paper explores the facilitators and barriers to delivering peer support effectively, as experienced by Peer Support Workers (PSWs) in a range of services and settings. We conducted semi-structured qualitative interviews with paid mental health PSWs working across a range of settings in England. We took a collaborative, participatory approach. Interviews were carried out by researchers with experience of living with and/or supporting others with mental health conditions, and for some having experience delivering peer support themselves, and data were analysed using methods guided by general principles of thematic analysis. We interviewed 35 PSWs with a range of roles that spanned a range of mental health areas, and regions. Overarching facilitators and barriers were identified including the need for roles to have flexibility with some structure and boundaries; the need for support, supervision and training to ensure PSWs are skilled in delivering the unique elements of their job; the importance of working with a strong team and leaders who support and value PSW; the complexity of working where there are tensions between the flexibility of PSW and the structures of existing healthcare systems, as well as the systemic factors such as funding, pay and progression can have an effect both on the personal experience of PSWs and on the value placed on PSWs in the wider organisation. Our findings highlight the complexity of peer support work and PSW roles, with a variety both of facilitators allowing them to carry out roles effectively and the barriers to doing so. As PSWs numbers and the scope of their roles increase, awareness of barriers and facilitators needs to inform PSW job roles, support systems and integration into teams and systems.",Shah P; Mitchell L; Machin K; Chipp B; Jeffreys S; Jeynes T; Persaud K; Grundy A; Repper J,NIHR Policy Research Unit in Mental Health (MHPRU) Lived Experience Working Group; Implementing Recovery through Organisational Change (ImROC),una.foye@kcl.ac.uk.

The implementation should follow a scientific method, and therefore shares many characteristics and the rigorous approach of clinical research. However, it differs in purposes, methods, and aims by addressing factors that include identifying and resolving barriers and facilitators in the adoption of evidence-based clinical innovations. The use of comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA) can be facilitated by technological tools, with the possibility of early diagnosis of several chronic conditions, monitoring and management of the diseases typical of older people and, finally, to personalized care and optimization of healthcare resources. However, remote CGA also has limitations, including technology requirements, data security/privacy, and the need for comprehensive evaluation and simplicity. In this document we present the history and the model of implementation of the Italian guidelines on CGA in older persons. The standardization of CGA in older adults across different settings is particularly important in countries like Italy, that have among the oldest world population and where broader implementation of CGA, also outside traditional geriatric settings, has become a health priority that cannot longer be delayed.",Castagna A; Ruotolo G; Azzini M,UOC Di Geriatria; SOC Cure Primarie; SOC Di Geriatria,nicola.veronese@unicamillus.org.

AI-driven screening using chest radiographs could improve early detection, reduce fracture risk, and improve public health outcomes. To assess the cost-effectiveness of deep learning models (hereafter referred to as AI-driven) applied to chest radiographs for opportunistic osteoporosis screening in German women aged 50 and older. A decision tree and microsimulation Markov model were used to calculate the cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained (€2024) for screening with AI-driven chest radiographs followed by treatment, compared to no screening and treatment. Patient pathways were based on AI model accuracy and German osteoporosis guidelines. Women with a fracture risk below 5% received no treatment, those with 5-10% risk received alendronate, and women 65 + with a risk above 10% received sequential treatment starting with romosozumab. Data was validated by a German clinical expert, incorporating real-world treatment persistence, DXA follow-up rates, and treatment initiation. Sensitivity analyses assessed parameter uncertainty. The cost per QALY gained from screening was €13,340, far below the typical cost-effectiveness threshold of €60,000. Optimizing follow-up, treatment initiation, and medication adherence further improved cost-effectiveness, with dominance achievable by halving medication non-persistence, and in women aged 50-64. AI-driven chest radiographs for opportunistic osteoporosis screening is a cost-effective strategy for German women aged 50+, with the potential to significantly improve public health outcomes, reduce fracture burdens and address healthcare disparities. Policymakers and clinicians should consider implementing this scalable and cost-effective screening strategy.",,,m.hiligsmann@maastrichtuniversity.nl.

Challenges with MAB adoption into clinical practice may vary depending on whether the institution is an academic/integrated healthcare organization versus a private neurological practice. We have combined demographic and clinical data from a high-volume East coast private neurology practice and a West coast academic memory clinic at post-MAB adoption. Combined data of N = 165 patient showed the following demographics: mean age 72, 67% female, 92% Caucasian, average MOCA 18/30 with amyloid status confirmed by CSF in 72% of patients. Overall, ARIA rates were 8% for ARIA-E and 7% for ARIA-H, and there were no mortalities over the observation period. Three patients required immediate medical attention due to ARIA radiographic findings associated with clinical symptoms. The private practice enrolled patients with lower average cognitive screening scores than the academic practice, but was more efficient at initiation therapy (mean # of weeks between diagnosis and treatment 97 versus 149 days). The average patient out-of-pocket cost was ($654.38) significantly less than the 20% of the annual drug cost as previously estimated. The findings from two separate clinical environments support the notion that ARIA risk associated with lecanemab is no greater than what was found in the CLARITY-AD trial and that the costs to the patient were less than predicted. This study was limited by the lack of 12 month efficacy data. Additional real-world data relating to the clinical effectiveness of MAB use in clinical practice will be necessary to best determine the risk/benefit ratio of these drugs in community populations.",Nimma S; Lutz H; Gzesh D; Weisman D,Abington Neurological Associates,mrosenbl@uw.edu.

We aim to analyze the user interaction with the SAGES website (sages.org) guidelines' page and guideline downloads from their associated journal Surgical Endoscopy to help inform the organization about its distribution and dissemination methods. Google analytics from the sages.org website and Surgical Endoscopy downloads for each guideline were obtained from July 2023 to April 2024, as well as number of downloads for the lifetime of the guideline. Data were organized by overall guideline popularity, defined as number of sages.org views or number of journal downloads, and its associated citations. Popularity by country was only informed by google analytics data from sages.org. The country's associated economic status-high, upper middle, lower middle, and low-income was obtained and a chi-squared test, applied to proportions, was performed on each guideline to determine if the economic status of the country significantly influences guideline popularity (p-value less than 0.05, confidence interval 95%). The hiatal hernia guideline had the most sages.org views and citations over the 9-month period; however, the management of diverticulitis guideline had the most journal downloads from time of publication. Colorectal surgery (CRS) guidelines were the most popular category in journal downloads which was not observed in sages.org views. Additionally, the popularity significantly differed in four guidelines based on the country's economic status. Society websites and journals were found to be reasonable platforms for dissemination of guidelines, with viewership and download numbers in the tens of thousands for some articles. The variability in engagement across platforms may suggest different audiences with different needs.

However, the specific cardiac abnormalities that bridge the gap between ECG abnormalities and subsequent events remain poorly understood. This study aimed to evaluate the relationship between ECG abnormalities and the prevalence of coronary artery disease (CAD) in propensity score-matched patients with suspected CAD who underwent comprehensive cardiac computed tomography (CT). A total of 357 patients suspected of CAD underwent ECG and cardiac CT assessments, including calcium scoring, stress dynamic CT perfusion (CTP), coronary CT angiography (CCTA), and CT late enhancement. Propensity score matching based on demographic parameters and CAD risk factors was performed, resulting in 286 matched patients (143 without ECG abnormalities and 143 with ECG abnormalities). In both unadjusted and propensity score-matched analyses, ECG abnormalities were significantly associated with microvascular dysfunction and myocardial scarring (p < 0.05 for both analyses). However, no significant associations were observed between ECG abnormalities and coronary calcification severity or obstructive CAD (≥ 50% luminal narrowing) in the propensity score-matched patients. Among matched patients without obstructive CAD on CCTA, those with ECG abnormalities exhibited a higher prevalence (30%) of microvascular dysfunction, particularly in the diffuse-transmural pattern, compared to that (14%) of patients without ECG abnormalities (p < 0.01). ECG abnormalities may not be reliable indicators of the presence of obstructive CAD. However, given their association with microvascular dysfunction, CAD evaluation with comprehensive cardiac CT, including dynamic CTP, is recommended for patients exhibiting ECG abnormalities, particularly to evaluate myocardial perfusion abnormalities. Question We investigated whether ECG abnormalities in patients suspected of having CAD are linked to epicardial stenosis, microvascular dysfunction, or myocardial scarring. Findings After adjusting for traditional risk factors using propensity-score matching, ECG abnormalities were associated with microvascular dysfunction and myocardial scarring, but not with epicardial coronary stenosis. Clinical relevance These results suggest that ECG abnormalities may offer important insights into tissue-level changes and microvascular pathology, rather than simply reflecting epicardial stenosis, thereby underlining the need for comprehensive cardiac assessment in patients with ECG changes.",,,s-nakamura@med.mie-u.ac.jp.

Structural signalling of trends in guideline adherence in clinical practice is essential for advanced updates. Recent advances in computable care guidelines allow automated evaluation using real-world registry data.

This retrospective cohort study uses real-world data of EC patients from the Netherlands Cancer Registry (NCR) between January 2010 and May 2022. The Dutch guideline for EC was parsed into clinical decision trees (CDTs). Primary outcome was guideline adherence for multiple (sub)populations, with secondary outcomes encompassing adherence trends, recommendation implementation pace, non-adherent treatment strategies and impact of additional non-guideline-based patient and tumour characteristics on adherence. The Dutch EC guideline was parsed into 10 CDTs, revealing 22 patient and disease characteristics and 46 interventions. NCR data were mapped to CDT data items. Four CDTs were successfully populated with NCR data, and 21 602 cases were assessed. Adherence levels were computed, which showed a mean adherence of 82.7% (range 44-100%). Three statistically significant trends in adherence were identified: two increasing trends in the 'non-adherent' compared with the 'adherent' group, and one decreasing trend.

The capacity to predict which children with central lines are at greatest risk of CLABSI could inform surveillance and prevention efforts. Our team previously published in silico predictive models for CLABSI. To prospectively implement a pediatric CLABSI predictive model and achieve adequate performance in offline validation for implementation in clinical practice. The most performant predictive models were deep learning models requiring substantial pre-processing of many features into 8-hour windows including the current day and up to 56 days prior for the current admission. To replicate this pre-processing, we created novel infrastructure to (1) organize current-day data for all the relevant features and (2) create a staged historical data store for those same features with application programming interfaces to connect the two. We compared predictive performance of these scores for CLABSI in the next 48 hours with two labels, one based on manual review of positive blood cultures in children with central lines and another based on positive blood culture and receipt of at least 4 days of new IV antibiotics. The area under the receiver-operating characteristic (AUROC) fell from 0.97 from retrospective data to <0.60 despite multiple iterations of troubleshooting. Primary root causes included train/serve skew, feature leakage, and overfitting. Hypothesized secondary drivers were complex model specification, poor data governance and inadequate testing, challenging feature translation between real-time and historical data models, limited monitoring and logging infrastructure for troubleshooting, and suboptimal handoff between the model development and deployment teams.

Despite established ethical guidelines, adherence remains understudied. This study evaluates how well top U.S. cancer centers comply with these standards in television advertisements. We analyzed 31 TV ads from 2019 to 2024 produced by members of the top 20 cancer centers as ranked by U.S. News & World Report, comparing them against ethical guidelines from the American Medical Association, American Society of Clinical Oncology, and others. Two independent reviewers categorized ads as compliant, borderline, or transgressive. Transgressive ads explicitly violated guidelines, while borderline cases contained ambiguous claims with at least one problematic interpretation. Of the 31 ads from 12 institutions, 16 (52 %) were either transgressive or borderline. Only 4 of 12 (33 %) institutions produced exclusively compliant ads. Common issues included unrealistic expectations (36 %), implying exclusive treatment availability (13 %), and unclear eligibility criteria (13 %). Notably, institutions ranked in the top 10 produced 71 % of the ads and were responsible for 8 of 9 transgressive cases. The prevalence of transgressive advertising suggests that ethical guidelines alone are insufficient. Potential solutions include increasing awareness among marketing leadership and enforcing compliance, possibly as a hospital accreditation requirement. Policy Summary: As cancer care continues to advance and treatment options become more complex, ensuring advertising practices adhere to extant ethical guidelines is crucial for supporting informed patient decision-making and maintaining public trust in healthcare institutions.",,,ajbaldassarre@uh.edu.

This retrospective observational study used data from the World Health Organization mortality database, which included patients with nontuberculous mycobacterial infection in 83 countries. We stratified the data by sex, age, and geographic region and calculated crude and age-standardized mortality rates to estimate long-term mortality trends. In total, 42,182 nontuberculous mycobacterial infection-associated deaths (58.1% in women) were reported in 83 countries between 2000 and 2022. The locally weighted regression model estimation for the nontuberculous mycobacterial infection-associated mortality rate more than doubled-from 0.36 deaths per 1,000,000 individuals in 2000 to 0.77 deaths per 1,000,000 individuals in 2022. Eighty-six percent of nontuberculous mycobacterial infection-associated deaths occurred in people aged ≥65 years. The mortality rate was the highest in the Western Pacific Region. This study highlights the impact of emerging nontuberculous mycobacterial diseases and the importance of targeted interventions for managing and reducing mortality, particularly in vulnerable older populations.

40354640,"Identifying Optimal Wearable Devices for Monitoring Mobility in Hospitalized Older Adults: Feasibility, Acceptability, and Validity Study.",2025-05-13,JMIR aging,10.2196/64372,"Hospitalized, frail older adults have an increased risk of developing hospital-acquired disability associated with hospital practices of restricted physical activity and immobilization. The use of activity tracking wearable devices may allow identification and prevention of mobility decline, reducing hospital-acquired disability. This study aimed to identify the optimal wearable device and wear location for monitoring mobility in older hospitalized patients. Specific objectives included (1) comparison of the feasibility and acceptability of ActiGraph wGT3X-BT (ActiGraph LLC), MOX1 (Maastricht Instruments), MetaMotionC (mBientLab), and Fitbit Versa (Google) for continuous mobility monitoring and (2) determination of the concurrent validity of the selected device for detecting body posture and step count. Participants were recruited for this observational study in the acute medical care unit of an academic hospital in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada. Eligible patients were aged 60 years and older, able to undertake the mobility protocol, and had an anticipated length of stay greater than 4 days. The study was divided into 2 experiments. Experiment 1 evaluated the feasibility of 4 wearable devices and validated the derived data for body posture and step count. Experiment 2 involved a mobility assessment session and a 24-hour monitoring and feasibility period with the selected device from experiment 1. The ActiGraph wGT3X-BT emerged as the most feasible device, demonstrating superior usability, data acquisition, and management. The thigh-worn ActiGraph accurately detected sedentary behavior, while the ankle-worn device provided detailed information on step counts and body postures. Bland-Altman plots and intraclass correlation coefficients indicated that the ankle-worn ActiGraph showed excellent reliability for step counting, with minimal bias and narrow limits of agreement. Patients expressed a high willingness to wear a continuous mobility tracking device at the hospital and at home. Thigh- and ankle-worn ActiGraph are optimal for assessing and monitoring mobility in older hospitalized patients. Challenges such as discomfort and device removal observed during the 24-hour monitoring period highlight areas for future studies. Overall, our findings support the integration of wearable technology in hospital settings to enhance mobility monitoring and early intervention strategies. Further research is warranted to evaluate the long-term use of wearable data for predicting health outcomes post hospitalization and informing clinical decision-making to promote early mobility.",,,

We discuss the selection of a control condition in comparative psychotherapy trials; the distinction between adaptations and other types of intervention modifications; the need for processes to ensure that an intervention is developmentally and diagnostically appropriate; and the provision of detailed descriptions of interventions in articles and supplementary materials, as well as making manuals publicly available, to ensure that reviewers and readers can understand the interventions delivered and can accurately interpret the results. We highlight the potential downstream implications of mislabeling an intervention and conclude that the comparison condition in Stice et al.'s (2023) article should be reclassified to avoid misinterpretation. There are published frameworks and guidelines available that promote more detail, precision, and transparency about interventions being tested in clinical trials. We believe it is time for journals to implement these guidelines to ensure that reviewers and readers can fully understand what interventions were tested to draw informed conclusions from the study, replicate research findings, and reliably deliver these interventions in clinical practice.

Specifically, we first theorize that CEO Mach positively associates with a CEO's total pay and severance pay. Moreover, because paying top management team (TMT) members more is also in CEOs' interests-such as to help build TMT loyalty and cooperation, aid hiring, and ease retention while also narrowing the CEO-TMT pay differential to thus provide an impetus for a CEO pay raise-we argue that CEO Mach positively relates to TMT pay as well. Using a longitudinal sample of S&P 500 firms and clinical psychologists trained to assess CEO Mach from publicly available data, we find evidence supporting our theorizing.

This study aimed to analyze the prevalence and nature of exclusion criteria in clinical trials for prostate, breast, and lung cancers. The EU Clinical Trials Register identified 51 protocols uploaded between 2022 and 2024. Thematic content analysis categorized exclusion criteria, and the justifications provided, while frequency analysis quantified their prevalence. After excluding five protocols (two non-English and three inaccessible), the final dataset comprised 46 protocols: 13 for prostate cancer (22.8%), 24 for breast cancer (42.1%), and 9 for lung cancer (15.8%). Exclusion criteria targeting vulnerable populations were present in 78.3% of protocols, categorized into five themes: psychiatric conditions (24.6%), neurological conditions (22.8%), other psychological conditions (22.8%), legal/guardianship status (5.3%), and unspecified conditions (24.6%). Compliance concerns (39.1%) were the most common justification, followed by informed consent challenges (32.6%), safety risks (13%), drug interference (10.9%), and not in the best interest (4.3%). Notably, 29.1% of protocols lacked justification for exclusions, raising ethical and transparency concerns. The exclusion of vulnerable populations may limit the inclusivity and generalizability of cancer research. Heuristic biases and systemic practices can potentially influence this. Exploring the role of these factors and considering adaptive trial designs, along with providing detailed justifications for exclusion criteria, could support more equitable and representative clinical research.",,,

In T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), KLF4 expression is silenced by promoter methylation, and the induction of KLF4 suppresses the proliferation of T-ALL cells. Therefore, KLF4 is thought to function as a tumor suppressor in T-ALL cells; however, its role in the differentiation of T-ALL cells remains unclear. Here, we show that KLF4 induced T-cell differentiation and apoptosis in TALL-1 cells harboring an activating mutation in NOTCH3. Mechanistically, KLF4 directly downregulated NOTCH3 expression by binding to its promoter, thereby promoting the differentiation of CD4/CD8 double-positive cells into CD4 single-positive cells, with the differentiated cells subsequently undergoing apoptosis. Furthermore, we found that APTO-253, a small-molecule inducer of KLF4, effectively suppressed cell growth in TALL-1 cells by promoting T-cell differentiation followed by apoptotic cell death. These findings suggest a promising strategy for developing novel differentiation therapies for T-ALL with NOTCH3 mutations.",,,

To quantify changes in frequent mental distress among females in Texas, following implementation of the 2021 Texas Heartbeat Act Senate Bill 8 (SB8), which banned abortions upon detection of embryonic cardiac activity. This cross-sectional study was conducted using 2012 to 2022 data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS), a population-based representative survey. Participants were aged 18 to 44 years and included females in Texas, males in Texas, and females in other states. Data were analyzed from May 2024 to February 2025. Implementation of SB8 in Texas in September 2021. The primary outcome was frequent mental distress, defined as 14 days or more of poor mental health during the past 30 days. Difference-in-differences models were used to examine the association between SB8 implementation and changes in frequent mental distress among females aged 18 to 44 years in Texas compared with males in Texas and females from other states. This study included 79 609 individuals (age proportion, 18 to 29 years [43.9%], 30 to 39 years [38.3%], 40 to 44 years [17.8%]; 15 614 females in Texas [25.5%]; 14 500 males in Texas [26.1%]; 49 495 females in other states [48.4%]). Between 2012 and 2022, frequent mental distress increased from 14.2% (95% CI, 13.2%-15.2%) to 21.9% (95% CI, 19.4%-24.4%) in 15 614 females in Texas and increased from 11.1% (95% CI, 10.2%-12.0%) to 15.0% (95% CI, 13.1%-16.9%) in 14 500 males in Texas. SB8 implementation in 2021 was associated with an adjusted increase of 6.8 (95% CI, 3.0-10.6) percentage points among females compared with males. In a stratified analysis by age group, SB8 was associated with larger increases in frequent mental distress among females aged 18 to 29 years (9.8 [95% CI, 3.1-16.7] percentage points) and females aged 30 to 39 years (7.4 [95% CI, 2.0-12.9] percentage points) compared with males. In adjusted models comparing females in Texas with females in other states, SB8 was associated with an increase of 5.3 (95% CI, 1.7-9.0) percentage points compared with females in 5 pooled states (Arkansas, Indiana, Kentucky, Mississippi, Oklahoma) and an increase of 6.1 (95% CI, 2.0-10.2) percentage points compared with females in California in frequent mental distress. In this repeated cross-sectional study, there was a significant association between SB8 implementation and an increase in frequent mental distress. Disproportionately higher increases among younger people could be associated with higher levels of anticipated or actual need for abortion care or less ability to overcome barriers to care, including travel. These findings signal that state abortion policy may negatively affect mental health.",White K,Resound Research for Reproductive Health,

There is also concern that bedtime antihypertensive use could induce glaucoma-related visual loss or other hypotensive/ischemic adverse effects. To determine the effect of bedtime vs morning administration of antihypertensive medications on major cardiovascular events and death. Multicenter, open-label, pragmatic randomized clinical trial with blinded end-point assessment and recruitment via 436 primary care clinicians across 5 Canadian provinces inviting their community-dwelling adult patients with hypertension taking at least 1 once-daily antihypertensive medication. Participants were recruited from March 31, 2017, to May 26, 2022, with final follow-up on December 22, 2023. Participants were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to using all once-daily antihypertensive medications either at bedtime (intervention group; n = 1677) or in the morning (control group; n = 1680). The primary outcome was time to first occurrence of all-cause death or hospitalization/emergency department (ED) visit for stroke, acute coronary syndrome, or heart failure. All-cause unplanned hospitalizations/ED visits, and visual, cognitive, and fall- and/or fracture-related safety outcomes were also assessed. A total of 3357 adults (56.4% female; median age, 67 years; 53.7% taking monotherapy) were randomized and followed up for a median of 4.6 years in each treatment group. The composite primary outcome event occurred at a rate of 2.3 per 100 patient-years in the bedtime group and 2.4 per 100 patient-years in the morning group (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.77-1.19; P = .70). Individual components of the primary outcome, all-cause hospitalizations/ED visits, and safety outcomes did not differ between groups. In particular, there was no difference in falls or fractures, new glaucoma diagnoses, or 18-month cognitive decline. Among adults with hypertension in primary care, bedtime administration of antihypertensive medications was safe but did not reduce cardiovascular risk. Antihypertensive medication administration time did not affect the risks and benefits of blood pressure-lowering medication and instead should be guided by patient preferences.

Unanchored MAICs were performed using individual patient-level data (IPD) for all apheresed patients randomized to the cilta-cel arm of CARTITUDE-4 (n = 208) and published arm-level data for EloPd from ELOQUENT-3 (n = 60), IsaKd from IKEMA (lenalidomide-refractory subgroup, n = 57), IsaPd from ICARIA-MM (n = 154), and SVd from BOSTON (lenalidomide-refractory subgroup, n = 53). Eligibility criteria from each comparator trial were applied to the cilta-cel arm IPD, and further imbalances in patient characteristics were adjusted by weighting the cilta-cel patient data to match the reported baseline characteristics of the comparator trials. Comparative efficacy was estimated for overall response rate, very good partial response or better (≥ VGPR) rate, complete response or better (≥ CR) rate, progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS). After adjustment, cilta-cel patients were significantly more likely to achieve an overall response versus EloPd, IsaPd, and SVd, and were significantly more likely to achieve ≥ VGPR and ≥ CR versus all comparators.

It has elucidated the radiological underpinnings of specific clinical phenomena such as pseudobulbar affect, apathy, behavioural change, spasticity, and language deficits. Academic concepts such as sexual dimorphism, motor reserve, cognitive reserve, adaptive changes, connectivity-based propagation, pathological stages, and compensatory mechanisms have also been evaluated by imaging. The underpinnings of extra-motor manifestations such as cerebellar, sensory, extrapyramidal and cognitive symptoms have been studied by purpose-designed imaging protocols. Clustering approaches have been implemented to uncover radiologically distinct disease subtypes and machine-learning models have been piloted to accurately classify individual patients into relevant diagnostic, phenotypic, and prognostic categories. Prediction models have been developed for survival in symptomatic patients and phenoconversion in asymptomatic mutation carriers. A range of novel imaging modalities have been implemented and 7 Tesla MRI platforms are increasingly being used in ALS studies. Non-ALS MND conditions, such as PLS, SBMA, and SMA, are now also being increasingly studied by quantitative neuroimaging approaches. A unifying theme of recent imaging papers is the departure from describing focal brain changes to focusing on dynamic structural and functional connectivity alterations. Progressive cortico-cortical, cortico-basal, cortico-cerebellar, cortico-bulbar, and cortico-spinal disconnection has been consistently demonstrated by recent studies and recognised as the primary driver of clinical decline.

The use of accurate thresholds, whether for aBMD or other imaging-based biomarkers, is crucial to improve sensitivity and identify high-risk older adults. Areal bone mineral density (aBMD) is a surrogate for bone strength but has limited prognostic value. Finite element (FE)-derived femoral strength offers a biomechanical alternative to aBMD for fracture risk assessment, but its long-term predictive value remains unclear. This study compared the discriminatory accuracy of aBMD and femoral strength for hip (HFs) and major osteoporotic fractures (MOFs) over 16 years, accounting for mortality risk. In the prospective Age Gene/Environment Susceptibility-Reykjavik (AGES-Reykjavik) Study, elderly participants underwent CT scans at entry and automated algorithms were used to compute aBMD and femoral strength. Time-dependent area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUC) was used to compare the predictive abilities of aBMD and femoral strength. Optimal cutoffs at the Youden's index were compared with the World Health Organization (WHO)-defined aBMD cutoffs at various time points. The cohort comprised 4621 older adults (mean age 76 ± 5 years). Femoral strength had a significantly higher AUC than aBMD in identifying HFs (p < 0.05) from the 6th year in males and females, while their AUCs in predicting MOFs were similar. WHO-defined aBMD showed low sensitivity (17-52%) but high specificity (78-94%) for both HFs and MOFs. The sensitivity of optimal femoral strength was significantly higher than that of aBMD at comparable specificity by 5-19% for HFs and 2-10% for MOFs (p < 0.05). Both image-based markers predict long-term fracture risk and enable opportunistic screening with existing CT scans. However, femoral strength demonstrates better discriminatory accuracy than aBMD. The low sensitivity of the WHO-defined aBMD demonstrates the necessity to revise current risk assessment criteria.",Praveen AD; Jha D; Ferguson SJ; Helgason B,Future Health Technologies Programme,anitha.dpraveen@sec.ethz.ch.

Over the past century, unprecedented advancements in medical science, public health initiatives, and social policies have significantly increased the global human lifespan. The debate between lifespan (the total number of years a person lives) and health span (the period of life free from chronic disease or disability) has gained considerable attention in both scientific and public discourse, with global focus now gradually shifting from merely living longer to living better. With this increase, a critical question has emerged: are these additional years truly spent in good health? As the global elderly population projected to reach 2.1 billion by 2050, this demographic shift is expected to place a substantial burden on health care systems, economic structures, and social frameworks. Emerging research in epigenetics, regenerative medicine, and lifestyle medicine suggests that preventive measures and personalised interventions can compress morbidity, promote healthier ageing trajectories, and ultimately increase health span. We review current lifespan and health span frameworks to foster dialogue among basic scientists, clinical specialists, social scientists, public health experts, and policymakers, advocating for a balanced approach that prioritises extending healthy, functional years of life over simply increasing lifespan.",Jugran D,,

The aim was to set research priorities, identify key themes and help inform subsequent research in the field. A national research collective was established comprising over 20 stakeholders, including FGM survivors/women with lived experience, healthcare professionals, academics and advocacy groups. The group undertook two discussion workshops with FGM survivors (n = 11 participants), two national stakeholder events (n = 142 attendees) and significant advocacy and partnership-building activities. Key insights were that FGM survivors would value reconstructive surgery to address body image concerns, genital pain and sexual difficulties. Potential barriers to surgery included stigma, safeguarding concerns, lack of awareness and fear. Significant gaps were identified around women's knowledge of clitoral anatomy, FGM types and specialist services. Survivors and stakeholders emphasised the need to complement surgical reconstruction with a comprehensive care pathway including trauma counselling and psychosexual therapy. This study highlights the importance of a survivor-led approach to FGM service development, as often the voices of FGM survivors are not included.

40353153,Retrospective analysis of recurrence patterns and clinical outcomes in grade I-III meningiomas after surgery.,,Surgical neurology international,10.25259/SNI_32_2025,"The objective of this study was to evaluate the outcomes of meningioma patients with the World Health Organization (WHO) grades I-III who underwent surgical resection and identify factors influencing recurrence and survival. This retrospective study included patients who underwent surgery for meningioma at the National Brain Center Hospital between January 2020 and December 2022. Clinical characteristics of patients with recurrence, such as gender, age, preoperative Karnofsky Performance Scale (KPS), grading, and history of radiotherapy, were recorded. The recurrence time was assessed within 2 years post-surgery. Magnetic resonance imaging or computed tomography imaging results were used to determine meningioma location, while the WHO grading was based on pathological findings. Survival analysis of recurrence across different grades was performed using Kaplan-Meier curves. Of the 184 patients who had surgical resection for meningioma, 53 (28.8%) experienced recurrence. The recurrence group consisted primarily of women (81%), with a preoperative KPS > 70% (83%), Simpson grading II-III (60.3%), WHO grade II (39.6%), and meningiomas located in the convexity (24.5%). Most patients (81.1%) had no history of radiotherapy, and 64.15% had two or more resections. The average recurrence-free period after surgery was 17.95 ± 20.39 months. Mortality due to recurrence was most common in the WHO grade II patients (11.1%). Kaplan-Meier curves showed differences in recurrence between grading subgroups, with the WHO grade III meningiomas exhibiting the highest recurrence rate and the worst prognosis. Higher-grade meningiomas are more likely to recur and result in poorer outcomes. Further research is needed to investigate tumor recurrence at the molecular level. A multidisciplinary approach to treatment improves outcomes and reduces complications associated with recurrence.",,,

A national working group was formed consisting of representatives from all regional healthcare organisations in Sweden and included all relevant healthcare professions, academia, and patient organisations. A mixed method iterative design and consensus approach was applied in the development of the P3C pathway. As a foundation, patient interviews along with a review of literature were conducted investigating the evidence base for healthcare interventions, earlier regional care programs/pathways and guidelines in Sweden as well as patient experiences and challenges with healthcare for LBP. Updated evidence-based clinical recommendations, tools supporting the practical use of the national P3C pathway and national healthcare data registry-based quality outcome indicators were then developed. Thereafter, an open consultation period provided review and feedback for final revisions and consensus. Essential factors for integrating best praxis according to scientific evidence and patient and healthcare professional perspectives were identified to establish a Swedish national P3C pathway for LBP. This provides a novel and innovative example of feasible methodology applicable in the international context.

Currently, there are no antiviral drugs or vaccines available. We have previously demonstrated that a simian adenovirus vector vaccine (ChAdOx1 prMEΔTM) and a virus-like particle-based vaccine bearing E proteins locked in covalent dimers (VLP-cvD) are effective against ZIKV infection in animal challenge models. In this study, we further explored the efficacy of these vaccines, either individually or in combination, using a heterologous prime and boost vaccination strategy in mouse challenge models. Although the individual vaccines provided good protection levels, the heterologous prime-boost vaccination regimen (ChAdOx1 prMEΔTM followed by VLP-cvD) offered the most effective protection. This regimen elicited a strong cellular response and high levels of neutralising antibodies, which were attributed to ChAdOx1 prMEΔTM and VLP-cvD, respectively. Our findings support the use of combined vaccine technologies and offer valuable insights into the multifactorial protection achievable through heterologous vaccination. These results have important implications for the development of effective vaccination strategies against ZIKV and other emerging viruses.",,,

This was a population-based study (Global Burden of Disease, Injuries and Risk Factors Study 2021). Adults aged 20 years and older from 204 countries and territories and 811 subnational locations from 1990 to 2021 were included. The primary outcomes were IS-related age-standardized prevalence, mortality, disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), average annual percentage change (AAPC), and risk factors associated with DALYs. From 1990 to 2021, the global age-standardized prevalence of IS decreased from 1,309 (95% UI 1,151 to 1,481) to 1,266 (95% UI 1,120 to 1,423) cases per 100,000 population, with an average annual decrease of -0.12%. However, the prevalence increased notably in the middle sociodemographic index (SDI) regions and East Asia but remained stable in Southeast Asia. The total number of IS cases still increased significantly from 33.2 million to 68.4 million. During the same period, the overall age-standardized mortality for IS decreased from 116 to 70 cases per 100,000 population, with an average annual change of -1.60%. Similarly, the overall age-standardized DALYs for IS decreased by 35%, with an average annual change of -1.36%. The decrease in both the age-standardized mortality and DALY rates was correlated with the SDI, with the most rapid decrease occurring in high-SDI regions. Conversely, in subregions of southern sub-Saharan Africa, an increase was observed. Males consistently faced a greater burden of IS across all subgroups. High systolic blood pressure and high low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels consistently represented the most significant risk factors contributing to DALYs from 1990 to 2021. Globally, the total IS caseload has increased. Targeted strategies, such as metabolic risk control in high-SDI regions, low-cost interventions in middle-/low-SDI regions, and improved neuroimaging infrastructure in sub-Saharan Africa, are needed. Future research should focus on subtype-specific burdens, the legacy effects of COVID-19, and intervention cost effectiveness to guide policymakers in developing efficient strategies to combat the global burden of ischaemic stroke.",,,

This study evaluates productivity losses for MG patients and their caregivers by MG symptom severity. In the multinational MyRealWorld-MG study, 1,049 MG patients and caregivers reported on work productivity (sick leave, reduced working hours, early retirement). Productivity losses were calculated using the average wage per hour. A UK perspective was adopted for the whole sample, and country-specific analyses were conducted for Italy, Spain and the US. The MG-Activities of Daily Living (MG-ADL) score was used to estimate the association between symptom severity and productivity losses, with patients categorized as having mild (0-4), moderate (5-9), or severe (> = 10) symptoms. In the MyRealWorld-MG study, 36.5% of MG patients reported taking sick leave within the last month and 11.4% reported stopping work (or retiring early) due to MG. Furthermore, 36.0% required caregiver support with 14.6% of caregivers reducing working hours and 13.4% stopping work. Mean productivity losses were £16,630/year for patients and caregivers combined, largely attributable to patient productivity losses (£13,891). Patients with severe MG incurred 3.8 times more productivity losses compared to patients with mild disease. Productivity loss estimates varied between Italy, Spain and the US. The impact of MG on patients' and caregivers' work productivity leads many of them to reduce work hours or retire early, resulting in significant productivity losses. The magnitude of these productivity losses is correlated with symptom severity and varies by country.",Dewilde S; Qi CZ; De Ruyck F; Paci S; Van de Veire L; Griffiths A; Mantegazza R; Phillips G,Services in Health Economics; argenx; Emeritus,
40352736,Criteria For Agreement When Conducting Local Consensus Discussions: A Qualitative Study.,,Journal of healthcare leadership,10.2147/JHL.S522784,"Healthcare is a complex, multi-layered team environment where effective change often requires reaching consensus among relatively autonomous stakeholders. Although conducting informal consensus discussions is a frequently used implementation strategy in real-world clinical settings, limited information exists about what defines consensus when using these methods. Specifying the criteria for consensus is important, as it can shape the design of consensus-building strategies. This study aimed to identify and define the key domains of consensus used in local consensus discussions to standardise healthcare practices. A qualitative study was conducted in one private hospital in Australia using a modified, grounded theory methodology. Clinical, non-clinical and leadership staff involved in developing standardised perioperative pathways using informal consensus discussions were recruited. Data were collected via semi-structured interviews and naturalistic participant observations between February 2023 and May 2024. Data collection and analysis occurred concurrently until theoretical saturation was achieved. Data were analysed using open coding with constant comparison, focussed and theoretical coding to develop theoretical concepts. Sixteen hours of observations with 31 participants and nine semi-structured interviews were conducted. Analysis identified four distinct consensus criteria: i) unanimous consensus, ii) delegated consensus, iii) assumed consensus and iv) concessional consensus. While unanimity was the preferred outcome, other consensus types emerged as viable alternatives when unanimous agreement was challenging to achieve. Each criterion had differing factors and mechanisms which influenced reaching the consensus criterion, underpinning assumptions, and considerations for practice, which formed four domains of consensus. These domains provide a structured framework for classifying consensus criteria when conducting local consensus discussions in healthcare. The findings broaden our understanding of consensus in local healthcare discussions, moving beyond a singular focus on unanimity. By clearly defining consensus types, organisations can strategically select consensus methods that best support decision-making and intervention implementation.",,,

However, most research on portable devices has not considered a wide range of ages and clinical conditions. This study aimed to evaluate the reliability of the Gripwise digital dynamometer in measuring handgrip strength in older Brazilian adults, comparing its performance with the widely used Saehan device. A cross-sectional study was conducted with 149 participants (32 men and 117 women), with an average age of 69.5 years. Handgrip strength was measured using both the Gripwise and Saehan dynamometers. Reliability was assessed using the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). Analyses considered three handgrip strength measurements from both devices, as well as the highest value obtained. The classification of dynapenia (low muscle strength) was compared using different cutoff points proposed by Villain et al. (2023), Spexoto et al. (2022), and Cruz-Jentoft et al. (2019). Both dynamometers demonstrated excellent reliability, with ICC values above 0.90. However, significant differences in mean handgrip strength values were observed between the devices (approximately 3.5-four kgf). These variations impacted the classification of dynapenia, with the Gripwise identifying more cases of low muscle strength compared to Saehan. The lower values reported by the Gripwise may impact clinical decision-making in two ways. On one hand, lower values may lead to earlier detection of muscle weakness, allowing for quicker intervention in individuals with strength below typical thresholds. However, this could also result in an overestimation of the prevalence of dynapenia if the values do not accurately reflect true muscle strength, which could lead to unnecessary interventions. Therefore, it is crucial to consider the need for adjustments in the cutoff points when using Gripwise. These findings highlight the need to revise cutoff points for dynapenia classification, considering device variations and model differences in older age groups.",,,

Mentors and supervisors, including faculty members, may face several challenges in providing supervision for psychologists in low-resource settings. As such, there is a need to develop best practices for psychotherapy supervision in global mental health. We describe the common challenges and potential strategies in psychotherapy supervision based on our research, clinical, and academic partnerships between academic institutions, a nonprofit organization, and the Nepali government. The strategies and considerations we have found helpful include focusing on therapies with strong behavioral and interpersonal (rather than emotional or cognitive) components and using locally validated therapies or standard manuals that have been endorsed by the WHO for low-resource settings. Other strategies include providing psychotherapy training for local psychiatrists who may be in supervisory roles using the train-the trainer models to help them gain competence in navigating different expectations of social structures and family dynamics. Supervisors face many challenges while supporting trainees and early psychologists in global mental health settings. While ensuring local adaptation, key considerations can be developed into best practices to support supervisors, particularly psychiatrists and other faculty members based in high-income settings, and trainees based in low- and middle-income countries.",Rimal P; Shrestha S; Khatri R; Sapkota S; Sigdel K; Acharya B,Possible,

These challenges can severely impact their quality of life (QoL). This study aimed to examine the relationship between intolerance of uncertainty, caregiver burden, and QoL among caregivers of children with autism. A cross-sectional study was conducted with 59 caregivers from six branches of the Obour Company for Human Development in Riyadh. Data were collected electronically using a sociodemographic data sheet, the Intolerance of Uncertainty Scale, the Zarit Burden Interview (short form), and the World Health Organization Quality of Life Scale (brief form). Findings revealed that two-thirds of caregivers experienced high to moderate levels of intolerance to uncertainty and a moderate burden, while 13.6% reported a high burden. Nearly 60% of participants reported low overall QoL, particularly in the psychological and social domains. A significant positive correlation was found between intolerance of uncertainty and caregiver burden. Additionally, significant negative associations were observed between QoL scores and both intolerance of uncertainty and caregiver burden, except in the environmental domain. Intolerance of uncertainty emerged as a significant inverse predictor of overall QoL. These results emphasize the psychological toll of caregiving for children with ASD. Interventions such as family- and community-based support programs and child behavioral training are essential to reduce caregiver burden and enhance QoL. Tailored services should be prioritized in clinical practice to support caregivers more effectively.",,,

A Delphi study was conducted to investigate factors influencing the implementation of AI-based DSSs in the hospital setting. The study included 36 experts with perspectives on the hospital setting and DSS development. A consensus was reached on the importance of 34 factors and the ranking as well as assessment of current realization of implementation factors revealed important starting points for implementation strategies. The study results indicate that whilst there are multiple factors of importance in DSS implementation, some factors, as e.g., promoting application- and user-orientated development of DSSs, establishing user-friendly organizational structures, and fulfilling demands of trust, transparency, and responsibility through sensitization and education on organizational but also legal level should gain more attention. In addition, two factors did not reach a consensus in terms of importance, indicating that it may not be practical to consider all factors of importance when implementing AI-based DSSs in the hospital setting.",,,

Initially, a rotavirus vaccination program was introduced in several provinces of Indonesia in 2022, which would be conducted nationally. This review provides information on the rotavirus genotype distribution in Indonesia, efficacy and effectiveness data of the rotavirus vaccine, and an update on the status of rotavirus vaccine implementation worldwide. The results show a varied distribution of G and P genotypes from 1978 to 2018, with G1-G3, G9, P[4], P[6], and P[8] as the prevalent genotypes, followed by a small proportion of G4, P[9], P[10], and P[11]. Three rotavirus vaccines, which are prequalified by the World Health Organization (WHO) and available in Indonesia, showed an efficacy of 17.6-76.9% in high-mortality countries. The Indonesian government procured ROTAVAC with a G9P[11] genotype for the national immunization program, which showed 31.3-69.1% protective efficacy against severe gastroenteritis caused by other strains. This review suggested that the decision to choose the rotavirus vaccine for the national program should take into account the country's prevalent circulating genotype and the vaccine's efficacy against severe diarrhea. The use of a pentavalent rotavirus vaccine with high efficacy in high-mortality countries can be regarded as the prime choice for the program. Another alternative is the rotavirus vaccine, which showed efficacy data in multiple high-mortality countries. In addition, regular surveillance of the rotavirus genotypes and the clinical manifestations of diarrhea are necessary to design vaccination strategies in Indonesia.",,,

Autoantibodies targeting aquaporin-4 (AQP4) and myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) play critical roles in disease pathogenesis, and therapeutic strategies encompassing immunosuppressive therapies and emerging biologics are employed to manage disease activity and prevent relapse. While studies suggest a potential overlap between NMO and other autoimmune neurological conditions, research in this area remains limited. This review explores the commonalities and distinctions between NMO and related autoimmune neurological disorders, hypothesizing that shared autoantibody mechanisms and clinical features may refine diagnostic criteria and therapeutic interventions. Additionally, it addresses tailored management approaches for specific clinical features of NMO and its overlaps. The paper also explores current research on biomarkers and novel treatment modalities, highlighting persistent knowledge gaps, such as understanding the immune mechanisms behind NMO and predicting individual responses to therapies. The review underscores the necessity for collaborative research efforts to improve diagnostic accuracy and therapeutic efficacy. Ultimately, these efforts will enhance personalized care strategies and optimize outcomes and quality of life for patients with NMO and related autoimmune neurological disorders.",,,
40352047,Assessment of Clinicopathological Response to Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy in Patients Diagnosed With Locally Advanced Breast Carcinoma.,,Cureus,10.7759/cureus.82057,"Introduction Globally, breast carcinoma is the most prevalent carcinoma and the primary cause of cancer-related deaths in women. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) is a widely used treatment approach for patients with locally advanced breast carcinoma (LABC), as it reduces the size of the tumor, making previously inoperable tumors operable. Studies suggest that patients with LABC achieve a high response rate following NACT. Still, no such research has been done to date in central India. So, this study was designed to evaluate the clinical and pathological response to NACT in patients diagnosed with LABC who presented at a tertiary care institute in central India. The primary outcome of our study was the clinical and pathological response following NACT in patients diagnosed with LABC. The secondary outcome was the comparison of the response to NACT in different molecular receptor subtypes of LABC. Methods After approval from the IEC (2044/IEC-AIIMSRPR/2021, dated 30/11/2021) and written informed consent from the patients, this study was carried out at All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Raipur, from January 2022 to January 2023. Fifty-six women, aged 18 years and above, diagnosed with LABC, were included in this study. Patients who were lost to follow-up, did not give consent, underwent previous cancer treatment in any form, had unknown immunohistochemistry (IHC) status, had inconclusive pathological reports, had fungating/ulcerative breast lesions, were pregnant or lactating, and desired to be pregnant shortly were excluded. Demographic details of the patients and baseline tumor characteristics were noted. Patients diagnosed with LABC were administered NACT using a standard regimen. After three months, the clinical and pathological response of the tumor to NACT was assessed. Patients who responded to chemotherapy underwent surgery, while those with static or progressive disease were continued on chemotherapy for an additional three cycles and then reassessed. Based on the histopathological report of the postoperative specimen, the subtype and grading of the tumor were done, and an assessment of the clinical and pathological response of the tumor to NACT in various subtypes was made. Results Fifty-six patients receiving NACT for LABC were studied. Post-NACT, significant improvement in tumor characteristics, including size, hardness, and fixity to the skin or muscle, was noted (P<0.05), and the number of patients with axillary and supraclavicular lymphadenopathy decreased significantly (P<0.05). A significant rise in the number of patients belonging to T0-T2 and N0-N1 stages, along with a decline in the number of participants belonging to T3-T4 and N2-N3 stages, was noted, suggesting a remarkable downstaging of the tumor (P=0.001) post-NACT. A remarkable improvement in the grading of the tumor was noted (P=0.001). Out of 56 patients, in 12 (21.4%) patients, a complete pathological response (cPR) of the tumor was noted, while in the remaining 44 patients, there was no change in the ER/PR and HER2-neu receptor status. Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) had a maximum cPR rate of 12.5%. Conclusion Post-NACT, a significant downstaging and downgrading of the tumor and downstaging of lymph nodes were noted. We conclude that NACT has a definitive role in patients diagnosed with LABC as far as the clinical and pathological response of the tumor is concerned. Also, the TNBC subtype responds maximally to NACT and carries a better prognosis.",Kashyap Y,Medical Oncology,

Yemen's healthcare limitations make understanding CD determinants crucial for maternal and neonatal outcomes. This study examines CD prevalence, predictors, and clinical implications at a rural Yemeni referral hospital. Materials and methods We conducted a retrospective analysis of 1,355 delivery records from Jiblah Referral Hospital, Ibb, Yemen, between December 2021 and September 2024. Using IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, Version 23 (Released 2016; IBM Corp., Armonk, New York, United States), we analyzed CD prevalence and predictors through multivariate logistic regression, examining both overall CD and its elective/emergency subtypes. Results The CD rate reached 48.3% (n=654), comprising emergency (40.8%, n=554) and elective (7.4%, n=100) cases. Strongest predictors included prior CD (adjusted odds ratio (aOR): 3.05, 95% confidence interval (CI): 2.18-4.27, p<0.001), women aged 20-30 years (aOR: 1.72, 95% CI: 1.21-2.45), maternal age >30 years (aOR 2.15, 95% CI: 1.46-3.17), urban residence (aOR 1.76, 95% CI: 1.28-2.42), multiparity (aOR 1.87, 95% CI: 1.36-2.56), and breech presentation (aOR 2.56, 95% CI: 1.82-3.60), while literacy showed a protective effect (aOR: 0.72, 95% CI: 0.53-0.98, p=0.036). Emergency CD correlated with fetal distress (aOR 3.02, 95% CI: 2.01-4.54) and hypertension (aOR 2.15, 95% CI: 1.42-3.25), while elective CD associated with advanced maternal age (aOR 2.34, 95% CI: 1.54-3.55) and urban residence (aOR 1.92, 95% CI 1.37-2.69). Conclusion This study revealed CD rates more than triple the WHO recommendations, with both emergency and elective procedures showing distinct patterns. Emergency CDs were primarily driven by acute complications like fetal distress, while elective CDs were strongly associated with advanced maternal age and urban residence. The high proportion of emergency procedures particularly highlights challenges in managing obstetric complications, whereas elective cases reflect demographic disparities in access and decision-making. These findings underscore the urgent need for facility-specific audits to reduce unnecessary procedures, enhanced training for obstetric emergencies and vaginal breech delivery, and context-specific research to address both clinical and non-clinical predictors in conflict-affected settings.",,,
40352039,Low Molecular Weight 35 kDa Hyaluronan Fragment HA35 Effectively Controls Post-surgery and Post-radiation Pain in a Patient With Hypopharyngeal Cancer: A Case Report.,,Cureus,10.7759/cureus.81957,"Hypopharyngeal cancer, a rare form of throat cancer, is typically treated with a combination of surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy. These treatments often result in severe pain and discomfort for patients, particularly after surgery and radiation therapy. Hyaluronan, a calcium channel TRPV1 blocker, can help alleviate pain. However, its clinical use is limited by its molecular weight, which affects tissue penetration. Low molecular weight hyaluronan fragments, such as HA35, have good tissue permeability and have been successfully used to treat various types of pain. We reported a case of a 50-year-old male patient with hypopharyngeal cancer, esophageal cancer, and metastases to the skull base. The patient reported nerve pain radiating to the temple due to surgical damage to the first cervical vertebra. This pain was unresponsive to five daily doses of painkillers following radiotherapy, and he required sedatives to sleep at night. He was treated with low molecular weight hyaluronan fragment HA35. The patient initially received a subcutaneous injection of 100 mg of HA35 in the shoulder and neck along with oral painkillers once daily. The timing of HA35 injections was based on the patient's self-reported numeric pain rating scale (NPRS), with an injection cycle typically lasting five to seven days per dose. After five injections, the patient experienced significant pain relief and no longer needed sedatives to sleep at night. Over a one-year follow-up period, the maintenance treatment with oral HA35 concentrate and the injection therapy following radiotherapy nearly controlled both regular pain and post-radiation pain. Moreover, the treatment substantially alleviated anxiety and fatigue while improving diet, sleep, and overall quality of life, as evidenced by improved scores on the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire-Core 30 (EORTC QLQ-C30). No adverse reactions were observed throughout the treatment course. These findings not only support previous studies on the efficacy of hyaluronan in mitigating radiation-induced pain but also suggest that low molecular weight 35 kDa hyaluronan fragment HA35 may offer a promising, well-tolerated strategy for long-term cancer pain management and improved patient well-being.",Jia X; Hui MM,Hynaut Laboratories,
40352038,Mycobacterium avium Complex-Related Pulmonary Parenchyma Destruction: A Case Report.,,Cureus,10.7759/cureus.82097,"Non-tuberculous mycobacteria, particularly Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC), have become significant causes of pulmonary infections, especially in immunocompromised individuals. MAC lung disease presents a diagnostic challenge due to its clinical overlap with other pulmonary conditions, including Mycobacterium tuberculosis infections. The need for microbiological confirmation and radiological evaluation complicates early diagnosis. New molecular diagnostic methods, such as PCR, have improved detection but are not universally accessible. Treatment for MAC lung disease typically involves a multidrug regimen including macrolides, rifamycins, and ethambutol. However, the disease often proves resistant to standard therapies, and treatment failure is common due to drug resistance, delayed diagnosis, and poor adherence. Recent research has highlighted the need for personalized treatment strategies and alternative therapies, such as intravenous antibiotics and host-directed treatments, to improve outcomes. The prognosis for MAC lung disease remains poor, especially in patients with preexisting lung conditions like bronchiectasis or rheumatoid arthritis, who are at increased risk of disseminated infection. This case report and review underscore the importance of early recognition and intervention, highlighting the role of a multidisciplinary approach in managing complex infections. Additionally, it emphasizes the need for continued research to identify more effective treatment options and improve patient outcomes in this growing patient population.",Manimaran A; Brown J,Critical Care Medicine; Internal Medicine,
40352036,The Role of Anesthesia in Sedation and Weaning From Mechanical Ventilation: A Systematic Review.,,Cureus,10.7759/cureus.82074,"Mechanical ventilation is a critical component of care in ICUs, yet its prolonged use can result in significant complications. Effective sedation strategies play a pivotal role in facilitating the discontinuation of mechanical ventilation and minimizing associated adverse outcomes. This systematic review evaluates the impact of anesthetic-based sedation methods on optimizing the process of weaning adult patients from mechanical ventilation in intensive care settings. A comprehensive literature search was conducted across major databases, including PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, the Virtual Health Library, and Cochrane CENTRAL, up to March 10, 2024, following established systematic review guidelines. Eligible studies included randomized controlled trials and observational research comparing anesthetic agents with conventional sedation techniques, with outcomes such as weaning duration, extubation success, length of stay in the ICU, incidence of delirium, sedation quality, adverse events, and mortality. Study quality was assessed using a validated methodological checklist. Out of 1,649 records screened, five studies met the inclusion criteria. Results indicated that dexmedetomidine was associated with shorter weaning times and reduced anxiety, agitation, and delirium compared to traditional sedation. Sequential sedation protocols, particularly transitions from midazolam to dexmedetomidine, yielded improved clinical outcomes, while enteral methadone significantly reduced weaning duration compared to fentanyl. Despite higher daily costs, anesthetic agents demonstrated favorable economic outcomes due to shorter intensive care stays. These findings suggest that targeted anesthetic sedation strategies may enhance the weaning process and improve overall patient outcomes, underscoring the need for further large-scale studies to validate and standardize these approaches.",Alfaifi MM,Department of Critical Care,
40352035,The Effects of Temporary Interruption of Hepatic Blood Circulation.,,Cureus,10.7759/cureus.81941,"Large-scale liver surgeries often require the temporary interruption of hepatic blood circulation, a process that can lead to potentially irreversible damage to the liver and other internal organs. This study aims to investigate the macro-morphological, histological, and ultrastructural changes in the liver and other organs following temporary hepatic blood flow interruption.  Experiments were conducted on 26 rats, randomly assigned to two groups: Group I (control: five rats) and Group II (rats that underwent bile duct ligation: 21 rats). On day 6, the hepatoduodenal ligament was ligated. Decapitation was performed at specific time points following ligature removal: 15 minutes (n = 7), 24 hours (n = 7), and 48 hours (n = 7). Tissue samples were collected for general morphological, histochemical, and electron microscopic analysis. The investigation revealed that damage to the liver and other organs after temporary hepatic blood flow interruption and subsequent restoration was more prolonged and severe in the presence of cholestasis than in its absence. Fifteen minutes after the ligature removal, new bile duct formation or ""neoductulogenesis"" was observed, creating an additional reservoir for congested bile. At 24 and 48 hours, a marked decrease in neoductule numbers was noted. This was attributed to the flow of congested bile into the bloodstream through new pathways, drainage of intrahepatic bile ducts, and reduced intrahepatic bile pressure. These changes precipitated hepatocyte metaplasia into ductal biliary epithelial cells and promoted further neoductulogenesis.",,,
40352026,Bilateral Seminoma in a Pediatric Patient With a History of Cryptorchidism: A Case Report.,,Cureus,10.7759/cureus.82080,"Synchronous bilateral testicular germ cell tumors (BTGCTs) are a rare subset of testicular germ cell tumors (GCTs) in pediatric patients. Cryptorchidism is a well-established risk factor for testicular cancer and markedly increases the risk of malignancy; thus, an early diagnosis is essential for effective management and prognosis. In this study, we discuss a case of a pediatric patient diagnosed with bilateral seminoma, treated surgically with bilateral orchiectomy. In this study, we describe a 16-year-old boy with a past medical history of bilateral cryptorchidism and orchidopexy, presenting with right testicular induration over the last month. Physical examination showed Tanner stage 3 genitalia with complete induration of the right testicle, but no palpable mass was detected in the left testicle. Scrotal ultrasound found heterogeneous nodules with increased vascularity, with microlithiasis involving bilateral testicles, prompting suspicion for a GCT. A bilateral orchiectomy with intraoperative biopsy was performed. Histopathological examination revealed bilateral seminoma, stage I, with the absence of any metastatic spread. Follow-up tumor markers and imaging study were unremarkable. In the pediatric population, bilateral seminoma is an extremely rare pathology with metachronous presentation more commonly described. The traditional risk factor of cryptorchidism remains important, highlighting the need for long-term follow-up of these patients. Diagnosis is based on clinical evaluation, imaging studies, and histopathological confirmation. Treatment usually consists of orchiectomy, with consequences for endocrine and fertility function. Due to the very low incidence of synchronous bilateral seminoma in this age group, a multidisciplinary approach is warranted with an emphasis on fertility preservation and hormonal follow-up. High-risk populations still require early detection via testicular ultrasound.",,,
40352020,Association of Vertical Facial Patterns With Maxillary Sinus Volume in Skeletal Class I Adults: A Cross-Sectional Cone-Beam Computed Tomographic Study.,,Cureus,10.7759/cureus.81927,"Introduction The morphology of the maxillary sinus (MS) is influenced by craniofacial growth patterns, with vertical skeletal discrepancies potentially affecting MS volume. This study aimed to compare MS volume across normodivergent, hyperdivergent, and hypodivergent individuals, and to evaluate the correlation between MS volume, the mandibular plane angle, and vertical maxillary height. Materials and methods This retrospective, cross-sectional study included 60 adult patients (age > 18 years) with a skeletal class I pattern and fully erupted permanent dentition. The patients were divided equally into three groups (n = 20 each): normodivergent, hyperdivergent, and hypodivergent, based on the mandibular plane angle. Cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) scans were obtained and analyzed using ITK-SNAP software for semi-automatic segmentation of MS volume (in mm³) and linear measurements of the anterior and posterior vertical maxillary heights (in mm). The bilateral MS volumes were measured independently by two calibrated examiners to ensure reliability. Statistical analysis was performed using ANOVA, Pearson correlation coefficient, and post-hoc Tukey tests (p < 0.05). Results The mean age was comparable across the groups (p > 0.05). No significant differences were found between the right and left MS volumes within groups, indicating bilateral symmetry. However, significant differences in MS volume and vertical maxillary height were observed across the groups (p < 0.05). Hyperdivergent patients exhibited significantly larger MS volumes and greater anterior and posterior vertical maxillary heights than hypodivergent patients. The normodivergent individuals had intermediate values. A moderate positive correlation was found between the mandibular plane angle and posterior vertical maxillary height (p = 0.016), whereas a stronger correlation was found with anterior maxillary height (p = 0.001). The MS volume showed a stronger positive correlation with vertical maxillary height than with the mandibular plane angle. Conclusion MS volume was significantly influenced by vertical maxillary height rather than the mandibular plane angle. Hyperdivergent individuals exhibited larger MS volumes and greater vertical maxillary heights compared to hypodivergent and normodivergent individuals. These findings highlight the role of vertical craniofacial dimensions in sinus morphology and may inform clinical decisions regarding orthodontics and maxillofacial surgery.",,,
40352001,Delayed-Interval Delivery in Multifetal In Vitro Fertilization (IVF) Pregnancies: Two Case Reports.,,Cureus,10.7759/cureus.81925,"Delayed-interval delivery in twin pregnancies is a rare but increasingly recognized obstetric intervention aimed at improving neonatal outcomes, particularly in cases of preterm labor. The rise in multiple gestations associated with in-vitro fertilization (IVF) has contributed to the need for optimized management strategies in such cases. However, there remains no consensus on standardized protocols for delayed twin delivery. We present two cases of dichorionic-diamniotic twin pregnancies obtained via IVF, where the birth of the second twin was delayed by 5 and 30 days. In the first case, a 31-year-old nulliparous woman presented at 24 weeks of gestation with preterm labor. Despite initial tocolysis and antibiotic prophylaxis, the first twin was delivered at 24 weeks, while the second twin was successfully retained until 28 weeks. The first neonate developed severe retinopathy of prematurity, while the second twin exhibited normal neurodevelopmental outcomes. In the second case, a 52-year-old multiparous woman with an IVF pregnancy and donor oocytes experienced premature rupture of membranes at 25 weeks, leading to immediate vaginal delivery of the first twin. Conservative management, including tocolysis and antibiotics, enabled the extension of the pregnancy for five additional days. The first neonate had a favorable postnatal course, while the second twin developed posthemorrhagic hydrocephalus requiring ventriculoperitoneal shunting. The decision to delay twin delivery is contingent upon multiple factors, including maternal stability, absence of chorioamnionitis, and the viability of the remaining fetus. Current literature suggests that prolonged latency between twin deliveries is associated with reduced neonatal morbidity when managed with strict maternal monitoring, tocolysis, and infection control. However, the benefits must be weighed against maternal and fetal risks, particularly the potential for intrauterine infection and placental dysfunction.  Asynchronous twin delivery remains a complex but potentially beneficial intervention for improving neonatal outcomes in cases of preterm labor, especially in IVF pregnancies. These cases highlight the importance of individualized management, vigilant maternal-fetal surveillance, and further research to establish standardized protocols for optimizing perinatal outcomes.",,,

While healing is perceived as inevitable, it heavily depends on tissue perfusion, which ensures oxygen and nutrient delivery, removal of waste, and promotion of cellular repair mechanisms. However, complications such as vascular occlusion due to fibrin or cellular debris, microbial contamination leading to infection, ischemic tissue necrosis, and dysregulated inflammation can impair healing. Proper care and repair are crucial to maintaining tissue perfusion and supporting the normal wound healing phases: reaction, regeneration, and remodeling. The use of oral enzymatic agents like trypsin, bromelain, and rutin offers a faster and more reliable method to support wound healing by reducing inflammation and enhancing tissue regeneration.

A comprehensive literature search of PubMed, Ovid, Cochrane, Web of Science, and Scopus from inception until June 7, 2022, was performed to identify eligible studies. Strict inclusion and exclusion criteria were applied to the identified studies. Data collection was performed by two independent reviewers with disagreements resolved by consensus review with a third reviewer. In total, 14 articles were chosen, with a total of 15 radiomics models. Of the included studies, 12 models reported sensitivity, with a mean of 0.778 (standard deviation (SD) = 0.073). Similarly, 12 models reported specificity, with a mean of 0.751 (SD = 0.111). The area under the curve (AUC) was reported by all 15 models, with a mean of 0.814 (SD = 0.081). Finally, accuracy was reported by eight models, with a mean of 0.768 (SD = 0.044). A meta-analysis was performed on eight studies that reported AUCs with confidence intervals (CIs), returning a pooled AUC of 0.764 (95% CI = 0.758 to 0.770). The Radiomics Quality Score (RQS) was applied to each included study as a measure of quality. RQS ranged from -1 to 22, with a mean of 13.4 and an intraclass coefficient of 0.874. Radiomics modeling has shown promise in serving as a diagnostic indicator for HPV status in patients with oropharyngeal cancer. Nevertheless, the quality of research methodologies in this area is a limiting factor for its broader clinical application and highlights the need for enhanced funding to support further research efforts.",,,

This case series highlights three patients who developed retrocorneal membranes following different ocular procedures. The first case involves a 67-year-old man with a history of right open globe rupture. He underwent multiple surgeries and developed corneal decompensation, for which Descemet stripping automated endothelial keratoplasty (DSAEK) was performed. He later developed a recurrent epithelial downgrowth (EDG) membrane. The second case presents a 79-year-old man who presented with a worsening vision to 3/60, one year after a complicated cataract surgery, due to a temporally growing fibrous downgrowth. The third describes a 70-year-old man who experienced blurred vision with visual acuity (VA) of 6/60, caused by a nasally growing fibrous downgrowth 10 months post-endothelial keratoplasty. All patients underwent retrocorneal membrane peeling combined with intracameral 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) treatment. This report discusses their clinical presentations, ocular imaging, treatment approaches, and histopathological findings. Retrocorneal membranes, particularly EDG, are difficult to manage and often result in poor visual outcomes despite treatment. While histopathology (HPE) remains the gold standard for diagnosis, clinical evaluation, anterior segment optical coherence tomography (AS-OCT), and regular follow-up are essential in guiding management.

40351968,Systemic Sclerosis and Primary Biliary Cholangitis: A Comprehensive Review of Two Overlapping Rare Entities With Insights on Diagnostics and Management.,,Cureus,10.7759/cureus.82008,"Primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) is an autoimmune liver disease of a chronic nature that can lead to liver cirrhosis, predominantly in females. PBC frequently coexists with other autoimmune diseases, such as systemic sclerosis (SSc), rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, and Sjögren's syndrome. Despite variations in the literature, most studies have reported that a few PBC patients have SSc, especially the limited cutaneous subtype. Pathology of SSc includes microvascular affection and widespread fibrotic changes along with the autoimmune process. This narrative review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the existing literature up to December 2024 regarding PBC, SSc, and overlap syndrome with emphasis on diagnostic points. Clinical manifestations can be significantly overlapping for both conditions. Thus, laboratory and histopathological investigations are necessary. The antibody profile is a cornerstone in such autoimmune diseases. While the antimitochondrial antibody (AMA) is considered specific for PBC, the presence of anticentromere antibody (ACA) highly suggests the concomitant presence of SSc. Several common pathologic mechanisms and triggers have been suggested for both diseases, and genes like HLA-DRB1, DQA1, STAT4, and IRF5 are shared between the two conditions. It is noteworthy that the prognosis and outcome of PBC cases are affected by the presence of SSc; for instance, the high liver-related PBC mortality decreases with the presence of SSc, although overlapping cases are at high risk of non-liver-related mortality. The overlapping cases comprise a clinical challenge for diagnosis and tailored management, although some promising medications are being investigated for both conditions, possibly due to common pathogenic mechanisms. Herein, we comprehensively review the available literature on PBC-SSc overlapping syndrome in terms of epidemiology, underlying pathophysiology, and clinical aspects.",Kommalapati V,Internal Medicine,
40351962,Artificial Intelligence in Primary Care Decision-Making: Survey of Healthcare Professionals in Saudi Arabia.,,Cureus,10.7759/cureus.81960," Artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to revolutionize healthcare, particularly in primary care, by improving clinical decision-making and patient outcomes. AI technologies, such as machine learning and natural language processing, can assist clinicians in diagnosing conditions, predicting outcomes, recommending treatments, and identifying at-risk individuals. Despite its potential, AI adoption in primary care is slow due to various challenges, including resource limitations, clinician training, and concerns about the reliability of AI systems. Understanding healthcare professionals' perceptions of AI is crucial for overcoming these barriers and promoting its integration into clinical practice.  A cross-sectional, survey-based study was conducted to assess healthcare professionals' awareness, usage, perceptions, and barriers to AI adoption in primary care decision-making in Saudi Arabia. The study included 250 healthcare professionals from primary care settings across urban, rural, and hospital-based clinics. Data were collected via an electronic survey that included both quantitative and qualitative questions, and analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistics.  A total of 250 healthcare professionals participated in the survey. The majority were primary care physicians (44.8%), with the remaining participants consisting of nurses (27.2%), medical assistants (15.6%), and healthcare administrators (8.8%). Awareness of AI tools was mixed, with 14.8% of respondents very familiar with AI and 47.2% unfamiliar. Thirty-one percent of respondents reported using AI tools, primarily for diagnostic support (59.5%). Common barriers to AI adoption included high implementation costs (49.2%) and lack of training (34%). A significant portion of respondents (48%) expressed concerns about AI undermining the human touch in healthcare. AI adoption in primary care is hindered by low familiarity and usage, as well as several barriers, including cost, lack of training, and concerns about the reliability of AI systems. However, there is optimism about AI's potential to support clinical decision-making. Overcoming these barriers through targeted education, infrastructure investment, and further research is essential for promoting AI integration in primary care and realizing its potential benefits for clinical practice.",,,
40351960,Patterns and Outcomes in the Management of Uterine Fibroids: A Hospital-Based Retrospective Study.,,Cureus,10.7759/cureus.81984,"Uterine fibroids are common benign tumors that can cause significant symptoms such as heavy bleeding, pelvic pain, and reproductive issues. The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical patterns, treatment modalities, and patient outcomes associated with uterine fibroids. This retrospective study was conducted at DHQ Hospital Okara, Okara, Pakistan, from June 2024 to December 2024. Data were collected from the medical records of 355 patients diagnosed with symptomatic uterine fibroids. Women who had confirmed uterine fibroids diagnosed through ultrasound were included in the study. Women who received treatment for uterine fibroids and patients with incomplete medical records were excluded from the study. Data were collected from medical records. The demographic information included age, marital status, parity, and reproductive history. The majority of patients were aged between 35 and 50 years (69.9%), with a mean age of 41.2 ± 7.83 years. Most patients were premenopausal (231, 65%) and multiparous (266, 74.9%). The most common symptoms were menorrhagia (248, 69.9%) and pelvic pain (195, 54.9%). The most frequent treatment modality was hormonal therapy (142, 40%), followed by surgical management (89, 25.1%) and minimally invasive procedures (53, 14.9%). Symptom improvement was highest in the minimally invasive group (92, 80%), while surgical treatments showed high patient satisfaction (64, 90%).

40351955,Transient Anti-Glutamic Acid Decarboxylase (GAD) Antibody Positivity and Insulin Secretion Reduction After IVIg in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus.,,Cureus,10.7759/cureus.82038,"This report describes a patient with type 2 diabetes mellitus who received intravenous immunoglobulin therapy for Guillain-Barré syndrome and subsequently experienced a sudden deterioration in glycemic control. Although anti-glutamate decarboxylase antibodies became positive and insulin secretion was transiently suppressed, both findings returned to baseline during the follow-up period. These changes initially raised concerns about new-onset or coexisting type 1 diabetes mellitus; however, the reversibility of anti-glutamate decarboxylase antibody positivity and the eventual restoration of insulin secretion argued against a new or evolving form of autoimmune diabetes. In type 2 diabetes, chronic inflammation may predispose individuals to immune dysregulation, and receiving intravenous immunoglobulin could transiently exacerbate underlying metabolic instability. In this case, however, the marked hyperglycemia and the brief period of suppressed insulin secretion did not lead to sustained autoimmune activity or permanent β-cell dysfunction. Instead, the patient's anti-glutamate decarboxylase levels reverted to normal, insulin production capacity improved, and classification as type 2 diabetes mellitus was ultimately reaffirmed. These findings underscore the need for clinicians to remain vigilant when interpreting new-onset antibody positivity or metabolic disturbances that arise shortly after intravenous immunoglobulin therapy. Repeated assessment of both antibody levels and insulin secretion is crucial to avoid premature changes in diabetes classification or therapeutic strategies based solely on transient antibody elevation. This case highlights the importance of recognizing that anti-glutamate decarboxylase antibody positivity and corresponding hyperglycemia can be induced transiently by immunoglobulin therapy and do not necessarily indicate progression to type 1 diabetes mellitus. Regular monitoring of metabolic parameters and clinical status over time can ensure more accurate diagnosis and management in patients with preexisting diabetes who experience sudden, unexplained changes in blood glucose following immunoglobulin administration.",,,
40351950,Application of Artificial Intelligence in the Interpretation of Pulmonary Function Tests.,,Cureus,10.7759/cureus.82056,"Background As per the Global Burden of Disease Study (GBD) 2019, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and asthma had a significant global burden. COPD is the fourth leading cause of death in the world and the second leading cause of death and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) in India. Pulmonary function tests (PFTs) are commonly used diagnostic tools. They include spirometry, body plethysmography, and diffusion capacity. In regions with limited resources, pulmonologists often only have access to spirometry. Additionally, PFT pattern interpretation is usually unreliable and subjective. Recent rapid advances in artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms can bridge the gaps. Objectives This study aims to compare the accuracy of the predictions made by AI algorithms with pulmonologists using limited clinical data and spirometry. It also examines the consistency and accuracy of pulmonologists' predictions based on the same information. Methodology Different AI algorithms were trained, and their accuracy was evaluated. Spirometry and limited clinical data from 440 patients were interpreted by an AI algorithm and eight senior pulmonologists. Accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) were calculated for the different patterns. Results Approximately 60% of the cases involved male patients, and about 70% were between the ages of 21 and 60. The Fleiss's kappa was 0.46. While the accuracy of pulmonologists against the gold standard was 65.82%, the accuracy of the AI was 86.59%. Conclusions PFTs, when interpreted by pulmonologists with limited clinical and spirometry data, have lower accuracy and higher variability. AI algorithms can consistently produce high accuracy. Adopting such technology among clinicians, especially in resource-constrained regions, could be pivotal for offering quality healthcare. In addition, it will also help in getting rid of inter-observer variability.",Singh S; Mishra N,Department of Microbiology; Department of Information Technology,

As a result, the adverse effects of the vaccine have been under scrutiny by the public eye. A comprehensive summary of the cardiovascular (CV) adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccines is vital for clinical recognition of rare adverse events, determining the public health implications, and creating a base for future research. In May 2023, a search was conducted in the PubMed and Cochrane databases to identify literature on CV complications resulting from the COVID-19 vaccine. All articles with relevant data and discussion regarding adverse effects of the COVID-19 vaccines were included in the review. In total, 4419 articles were screened, and 166 articles were included in the review. The vaccine-associated CV adverse events encompassed the following conditions: myocarditis, pericarditis, acute coronary syndrome, stress cardiomyopathy, hypertension, isolated tachycardia, myocardial infarction (MI) with nonobstructive coronary arteries (MINOCA), cardiac arrest, vaccine-induced thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT), MI, cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT), deep vein thrombosis (DVT), pulmonary embolism (PE), and other venous thrombotic disorders. Among these, myocarditis and thrombosis, especially VITT, emerged as the most frequently cited complications in the reviewed literature. Ranges of incidences for the following were recorded among the reviewed articles: myocarditis: 2 to 17 per million, VITT: 3-10 per million, CVST: 2.6-10 per million, MI: 3-4 per million. COVID-19 vaccines entail the potential for adverse events, although at low incidence, some of which exhibit notable severity. These adverse events exhibit demographic specificity and vaccine-specific profiles. The adverse events reviewed are uniformly acute in nature. The existing body of evidence offers limited support for the assertion that COVID-19 vaccines may elevate the baseline risk of CV events in the long term. However, the available research on effects greater than six months is scarce.",,,

40351936,The Relationship Between the Clavicular Tilt Angle and Sagittal Spinal Alignment Associated With Hyperkyphosis Posture.,,Cureus,10.7759/cureus.82044,"Introduction Hyperkyphosis is a deformity of the spine's forward curvature in the sagittal alignment, and its indices include the sagittal vertical axis (SVA), thoracic kyphosis (TK), and lumbar lordosis angle (LLA). These indices are difficult to evaluate in patients who cannot maintain a standing position. Therefore, we sought to determine whether the mean clavicular tilt angle, which can be evaluated regardless of the patient's posture, can be used as an indicator of hyperkyphosis. We hypothesized that the mean clavicular tilt angle would correlate with established sagittal spinal alignment parameters and could serve as a reliable surrogate indicator of hyperkyphosis in patients unable to stand. Hyperkyphosis can be evaluated using the indices that require standing or sitting. However, no studies have attempted to evaluate hyperkyphosis regardless of the patient's posture. Methods This retrospective study analyzed 106 patients (aged ≥65 years) who underwent surgery for lumbar spinal canal stenosis at our hospital between March 2023 and July 2024. All patients had both a plane radiography of the frontal plane including the clavicle and a plane radiography of the entire spine in the sagittal plane from the cervical spine to the pelvis taken before surgery. The mean clavicular tilt angle was measured using two methods: the conventional method and a newly devised method. The new method modifies the angle reference point to enhance applicability in cases with extreme postural deformities. The correlation between the clavicular tilt angle and SVA, TK, and LLA was examined for each method. Results A positive correlation (r = 0.343, p < 0.05) was found between the mean clavicular tilt angle and TK using the conventional method. A positive correlation (r = 0.562, p < 0.05) was found between the mean clavicular tilt angle and SVA using the new method, and a negative correlation (r = -0.437, p < 0.05) was found between the mean clavicular tilt angle and LLA using the new method, indicating moderate to strong correlations with spinal alignment parameters. Conclusions This study suggests that the mean clavicular tilt angle may be a useful indicator of hyperkyphosis. In particular, the new measurement method may serve as a practical tool for evaluating hyperkyphosis in frail or immobile populations. However, being a single-center retrospective study, these findings require validation through larger prospective studies.",,,

It exhibits a slow-growing yet locally aggressive behavior, most frequently presenting in young adults, although it can occur at any age and shows no significant gender predilection. Despite its clinical relevance, current research provides limited information regarding the risk factors, causative agents, and molecular pathways that contribute to its development and aggressive behavior. We present a case of OFM located in the mandible of a 38-year-old African male who reported a painless swelling in the right mandible extending from the first premolar to the second premolar. The clinical examination revealed a limited, firm, painless vestibular swelling in the region of teeth 44 and 45. The affected teeth exhibited normal vitality and physiological mobility. Radiographic imaging demonstrated a multilocular radiolucency with a ""soap bubble"" appearance, without evidence of root resorption. Histopathological analysis confirmed the diagnosis of odontogenic fibromyxoma, showing a proliferation of fibroblasts and myofibroblasts within a loose, myxomatous stroma rich in acid mucopolysaccharides, with scattered stellate cells displaying minimal pleomorphism. This case underscores the importance of a comprehensive diagnostic approach that integrates clinical, radiological, and histopathological findings to accurately identify OFM and distinguish it from other similar jaw lesions. Although conservative treatments such as enucleation with curettage offer notable benefits, the ideal surgical approach and follow-up protocol remain subjects of ongoing investigation. A more profound understanding of OFM's underlying pathogenesis could lead to improved treatment outcomes and guide future research on targeted therapeutic strategies.",,,

Despite increasing global incidence, optimal prehospital preservation strategies are underutilized, reducing the likelihood of successful replantation. This scoping review was performed as part of the International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation's (ILCOR) continuous evidence evaluation process to update the 2025 ILCOR Consensus on Science with Treatment Recommendations. Our aim was to scope the research literature on prehospital preservation methods used for amputated or avulsed body parts and their impact on replantation success. We searched PubMed, Embase, CENTRAL, CINAHL, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform from inception through February 26, 2025, for studies comparing approaches to preserve completely amputated or avulsed body parts in the out-of-hospital setting. Data on first aid intervention characteristics, ischemic times, and replantation outcomes were summarized. We concurrently reviewed first aid guidelines and participant manuals from global organizations to assess strategies taught for the management and storage of amputated body parts. Thirty-nine publications were included in the final analysis, with the majority (73%) being case reports. No randomized controlled trials were identified that directly compared different cold storage techniques (e.g., ice-water immersion vs. dry cold storage). Key findings emphasized the importance of cooling amputated parts after wrapping with saline-moistened gauze and double-bagging to extend ischemic tolerance. This review identified an extensive evidence base suggesting that nonfreezing cold preservation of amputated or avulsed body parts as soon as possible after injury is associated with survival of replantation and improved function and cosmesis. Training first aid providers, standardizing prehospital protocols, and increasing public awareness could enhance patient outcomes and expand access to replantation globally. However, additional studies are needed to identify alternative means of sustained cold storage of amputated body parts, especially in low-resource first aid settings.",Thilakasiri K,Ministry of Health,
40351922,Perspectives of Healthcare Professionals on the Management of Patients With Tracheostomy.,,Cureus,10.7759/cureus.82051,"Introduction Tracheostomy is a critical and common intervention for respiratory support. The complexity of cases requires vigilance, skilled personnel, and close interdisciplinary collaboration. Objective This study aims to highlight the complexity and interdisciplinary nature of tracheostomy care. By exploring healthcare professionals' perspectives on which specialties are most suitable for each stage of management, the study seeks to identify current clinical practices, uncover limitations, and suggest improvements in care delivery. Methodology The first part of the study involved a literature review, providing a scientific overview of the essential and multifaceted demands of tracheostomy care. In the second part, a quantitative approach was applied, utilizing a well-structured questionnaire to collect data from 101 healthcare professionals regarding their views on tracheostomy management. The research was conducted from September 1, 2023, to October 20, 2023, in public hospitals in Athens, Greece. The questionnaires were electronically distributed via Google Forms, and responses were analyzed using IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, Version 27 (Released 2020; IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA). Results The literature indicates that tracheostomy cases are encountered frequently in clinical practice and require complex, specialized, and multidisciplinary care. Despite their frequency and impact, there is a lack of standardized guidelines for their management, leading to inconsistent practices and preventable complications, often resulting in prolonged hospitalizations, Intensive Care Unit (ICU) readmissions, increased healthcare costs, and elevated morbidity and mortality rates. The questionnaire examined 20 key clinical actions across different care stages. Most participants identified the otolaryngologist as the most appropriate for half of these tasks, including tracheostomy placement, patient education, tube selection, cuff decisions, fistula management, hygiene, swallowing assessment, and cuff explanation. Nurses were associated with direct patient care - stoma management, suctioning, oral hygiene, and safe feeding practices. Speech therapists were linked to communication support and alternative communication training. Pulmonologists were assigned respiratory function oversight, dietitians, nutrition planning, and psychologists, emotional support. Research hypotheses were developed to explore differences in opinions based on demographic and professional variables, including gender, age, education, experience, specific training, and engagement with current practices. These findings emphasized both the importance of experience and the lack of standardized role definitions in tracheostomy care. Conclusions Tracheostomy management places a significant burden on healthcare systems due to its intensive and multifaceted demands. Effective resource and personnel management can reduce complications, enhance patient safety and the quality of care, and improve patient outcomes, while simultaneously contributing to the economic sustainability of the healthcare system. While the specialization of Otorhinolaryngology appears most suitable for many actions, there is a recognized need for other professionals for specific vital tasks. It is the responsibility of healthcare units to establish interdisciplinary teams with specialized knowledge, proper training, and clearly defined roles to ensure safe, efficient, and high-quality care delivery.",,,
40351909,An Objective Analysis of the Quality and Readability of Online Information on Breast Implant Illness.,,Cureus,10.7759/cureus.82042,"Breast implant illness (BII) has emerged as a significant concern for patients with breast implants, characterized by a range of symptoms, including fatigue, cognitive impairment, and joint pain. The growing recognition of BII has prompted increased scientific investigation. However, despite the rising prevalence of breast augmentation procedures, there remains a lack of consensus within the medical community regarding the diagnosis, etiology, and treatment of BII. This study aimed to evaluate the readability of online resources pertaining to BII to determine their accessibility to the general population. A systematic internet search was conducted using three major search engines (Google, Bing, and Yahoo) with the query ""breast implant illness."" After excluding duplicates and paid content, 28 unique websites were analyzed using five established readability indices: Flesch-Kincaid Reading Ease Score (FRES), Gunning-Fog Index, Coleman-Liau Index, Simplified Measure of Gobbledygook (SMOG), and Automated Readability Index. The results revealed a considerable range in the readability of online materials related to BII. The average FRES was 50.4, categorizing the material as ""fairly difficult"" to read. The Gunning-Fog Score averaged 9.3, suggesting a 9th-grade education level for comfortable comprehension. The SMOG Index indicated a reading level appropriate for individuals with at least 13 years of education. The Coleman-Liau Index suggested a reading level corresponding to a 21-year-old, while the Automated Readability Index pointed to a high school freshman level. These findings highlight a significant disparity between the readability of available information and the recommended standards set by the American Medical Association and the National Institutes of Health, which propose that patient education materials should be written at a 6th-grade reading level or lower. The study's results are consistent with research on the readability of online health information in other domains, identifying a mismatch between the reading level of the general public and the complexity of available health information. The importance of readability in online health information cannot be overstressed, particularly in the context of BII, where decisions may include elective surgery with inherent risks. The study calls for the development and implementation of standardized guidelines for creating online health materials that are accessible to a diverse audience. This includes simplifying language, using clear formatting, and incorporating visual aids to enhance comprehension.",,,
40351904,"A Critical Narrative Review of Medical School Curricula: Teaching Methods, Assessment Strategies, and Technological Integration.",,Cureus,10.7759/cureus.82015,"Medical education is a continuously evolving discipline that requires ongoing curriculum reform to align with the changing healthcare landscape. The increasing complexity of patient care, advancements in medical technology, and the need for physicians to possess both clinical acumen and humanistic qualities necessitate a re-evaluation of traditional medical training approaches. This narrative review critically examines the structure of medical school curricula, including teaching methods, assessment strategies, and technological integration. It explores evidence-based strategies and emerging trends to identify critical gaps and provide recommendations and areas for further research. Various teaching methods are compared and contrasted, including integrated and traditional curricula, problem-based and team-based learning, early and late clinical exposure, and interdisciplinary education. Assessment strategies examined include written exams and objective structured clinical examinations (OSCEs), along with formative and summative assessments. The integration of technology, particularly virtual reality (VR) and artificial intelligence (AI), is also discussed.  For the review, we utilized SciSpace (PubGenius Inc.; https://scispace.com), a search engine that provides access to a vast collection of peer-reviewed research papers from various databases. We assessed for bias and quality, including all papers from this century that contained the relevant keywords and key phrases. A narrative critical review style was chosen for its flexibility to provide insight into the current body of literature on this topic, in contrast to an empirical systematic review that is more comprehensive.  Our findings indicate that institutions are transitioning from a traditional to an integrated curriculum. Incorporating both problem-based and team-based learning proves more effective in curriculum design. The costs and benefits of OSCEs should be weighed individually by each school to guide efficient implementation. Furthermore, both formative and summative assessments are vital. AI and VR are essential as medical education evolves and require continuous monitoring. Additionally, early clinical exposure is more beneficial for students, and interdisciplinary education fosters better patient outcomes.",,,

Hematologic evaluation revealed an elevated M-spike of IgM and a high MAG antibody titer. His initial titer was measured at 1:102400 on February 28, 2023. These findings were consistent with the diagnosis of Waldenström macroglobulinemia (WM) with associated anti-MAG antibody neuropathy. The patient was started on rituximab and reported a slight improvement in symptoms. However, the patient felt the efficacy of rituximab diminished with each subsequent dose. Due to this, the patient was initiated on zanubrutinib. Close monitoring of clinical symptoms and laboratory parameters was conducted to assess treatment response and potential side effects. Following zanubrutinib therapy, the patient exhibited mild improvement in neuropathic symptoms, which have stabilized, although still present. Serologic examination demonstrated a decrease in anti-MAG-antibody titer at 1:25600 in the spring of 2023 and 1:51200 in November of 2023. Patient reports increased fatigue and musculoskeletal pain. This clinical vignette highlights the outcomes of zanubrutinib in the management of anti-MAG antibody neuropathy in a patient with WM. Further research and larger clinical trials are warranted to validate these findings and establish zanubrutinib as a viable therapeutic option for this rare and often challenging neurological disorder.",,,

Negative perspectives reflect a serious gap in reproductive health education among future parents and may lead to delaying parenthood, increasing the risk of infertility or fetal loss. Aim This study aimed to assess students' perspectives on fertility-related issues and motherhood across multi-country backgrounds. Methods A descriptive, cross-sectional design was conducted from Spring 2021 to Spring 2022 among voluntary participants focused on the fertility and motherhood perspectives of health sciences colleges in six participating countries (Egypt, Iraq, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Sudan, and Turkey).

Although clinically significant, studies have revealed gaps in physicians' attitudes and practices regarding drug-induced anaphylaxis, potentially affecting patient safety. This study assessed physicians' attitudes and practices related to drug-induced allergies. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted among 167 physicians across four hospitals in the Qassim region using a validated structured questionnaire. The tool assessed three domains: demographic characteristics, attitudes toward drug allergy management, and clinical practices. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics with IBM SPSS Statistics software, version 26 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY). Results A total of 167 physicians were included in the study. Attitudes toward drug allergy management were largely positive, with 91.6% (n=153) recognizing the need for advanced training. However, practice patterns varied, with only 50.3% (n=84) consistently recognizing and managing drug hypersensitivity reactions. The availability and routine use of drug allergy testing was reported by 47.3% (n=79), yet accurate interpretation remained low (31.9%, n=53). Although 65.7% (n=110) routinely obtained allergy histories, proper skin test controls were performed by only 20.1% (n=34). Conclusion While physicians exhibited positive attitudes toward drug allergy management, inconsistencies in clinical practice were evident. Deficiencies in diagnostic awareness, reliance on inaccurate testing methods, and variable adherence to management guidelines underscore the need for targeted educational interventions.",,,

This study aims to assess the feasibility, safety, and preliminary efficacy of a combined mindfulness-based and cognitive-motor intervention, with a view to future optimization and broader application. This single-arm design study will involve older adults with subclinical depression aged 60 years and above. Participants will undergo an 8-week intervention combining mindfulness practices and cognitive-motor exercises. The primary outcomes will be feasibility and adherence to the intervention, and the secondary outcomes will be depressive and anxiety symptoms, cognitive function, activities of daily living, and safety. Additional secondary outcomes will be brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings and serum cortisol levels. We anticipate high feasibility and adherence, with minimal adverse events. Improvements are expected in depressive and anxiety symptoms, cognition, and function, along with reduced cortisol levels. MRI may reveal structural and functional changes in brain regions associated with emotional regulation and cognition. Findings will inform the development of scalable digital interventions. This study will provide initial evidence on the utility of integrating mindfulness and cognitive-motor approaches for older adults with subclinical depression.

However, current practices around collecting and distributing such data to trainees are not effective. Specifically, it is not clear what patient data are significant and compelling to trainees for reflective practice. The goal of our study was to characterize trainee perspectives on what data are meaningful to promote reflective activities for learning in the clinical work environment. From 2020-2021, we conducted a longitudinal cross-sectional study to assess trainee interest in clinical outcomes data. Over 14 days, pediatrics and internal medicine residents doing inpatient work at the University of California San Francisco completed surveys corresponding to recently opened patient charts. 958 surveys were completed by 41 participants (average 23 unique patient encounters per participant). Trainees expressed interest in follow-up for 32.9% of encounters (n = 315/958), most often to 'learn if something significant or unexpected happened.' Trainees most often desired follow-up patient data when they had made significant decisions or felt responsible. Trainees were interested in clinical outcomes data for a limited number of patient encounters, highlighting challenges with current strategies to promote reflective practice using clinical outcomes data. While refinement of such approaches continues through consideration of what trainees find meaningful in data, understanding motivating and demotivating factors in trainees' outcomes data-seeking behaviors will also be crucial for success in using such data for learning opportunities.",,,

While residents are expected to take an active role in their learning, little is known about how they actually experience learning and working within the EPA framework. This study explores paediatric residents' experiences of learning, working, and developing within an EPA-based training programme. We conducted a qualitative study using semi-structured interviews with 11 paediatric residents from three of the seven Dutch training regions. Interviews were transcribed verbatim, anonymised, and analysed using template analysis to identify themes related to residents' learning and professional development within EPA-based training. Residents described increasing confidence and competence in the phase prior to entrustment. Some linked this development to the EPA structure, as it supported goal setting and feedback-seeking, while others attributed this development primarily to learning through clinical experience.The entrustment decision process-particularly the Clinical Competence Committee (CCC) feedback-was seen as reassuring, though residents also described discomfort with being evaluated by a group. After entrustment, residents experienced greater autonomy but noted variation in supervision practices. Some felt unsure about when to request supervision, particularly in apparently straightforward settings. Others described feeling empowered to pursue individualised learning opportunities. In reflecting on these findings, we drew on the concept of Self-Regulated Learning to explore how residents engaged with their training. Making these principles more explicit within EPA-based programmes may support residents in optimising their learning and strengthen their preparation for independent practice.",,,

Shifting from traditional dispensing to clinical roles requires professional development and identity transformation. In South Africa's public healthcare system, this shift faces additional challenges, such as a lack of formal positions, limited resources, and role ambiguity. Understanding how clinical pharmacists navigate this transition and develop their clinical identity is essential for their integration into healthcare teams and for improving patient care. Using a constructivist approach, this qualitative study employed semi-structured interviews with clinical pharmacists (n = 12) across South Africa's public healthcare sector. We analyzed data through the lens of boundary crossing. Through thematic analysis we explored how pharmacists navigate the complexities of transitioning from dispensing to broader clinical roles, and how these experiences shape their professional identity. Clinical pharmacists navigated both intrapersonal and interpersonal boundaries in their evolving roles. Three key themes were identified: (a) Bridging the gap within: Pharmacists navigate intrapersonal boundaries for clinical identity formation, (b) Bridging the gap between: Pharmacists navigate interprofessional boundaries for collaboration and identity formation, and (c) Building bridges: Pharmacists employ strategies to promote collaboration and recognition. This study uncovered the complex interplay between intrapersonal boundaries - such as role ambiguity, self-doubt, reconciling traditional dispensing roles with expanded clinical responsibilities, and the need for mentorship - and interpersonal boundaries, including hierarchical structures, unclear role expectations, limited recognition, and challenges in interprofessional collaboration, in shaping clinical pharmacists' identities. Fostering boundary crossing competence and interprofessional collaboration can help overcome systemic barriers, enabling pharmacists to navigate their roles, advocate for their expertise, and gain recognition within healthcare teams, ultimately enhancing their integration and improving patient care in resource-constrained settings like South Africa.",Stoffels M; Kusurkar RA; Wouters A,Amsterdam UMC location Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam,

Systemic disparities continue to affect racially marked individuals and cultural minorities, underscoring the need to explore how these issues are perceived by future healthcare professionals. This study examines how medical students understand racism and intercultural competence in clinical settings, using the example of Muslim patient care, and compares their perspectives with national-level developments. Methods A qualitative case study was conducted with 65 medical students enrolled in an elective course on ethical aspects of caring for Muslim patients. Participants responded to open-ended questions regarding their motivations, clinical experiences, and educational goals. Responses were analyzed using structured qualitative content analysis (MAXQDA 24©, VERBI, 2024). Results Ten central themes emerged, including communication barriers, limited awareness of culture- and faith-specific practices, and the importance of individualized care. While racism and discrimination were acknowledged, they were addressed less frequently. The reflections aligned with broader observations on structural inequalities and the need for culturally sensitive care. Conclusion The findings reveal notable gaps in intercultural competence among future physicians, with implications for both clinical care and medical education. Students identified relevant challenges but lacked tools to address them confidently. Although preliminary, these results highlight the need to further integrate topics such as racism, religious diversity, and structural discrimination into medical training. Doing so may better prepare healthcare professionals to deliver equitable and patient-centered care in an increasingly diverse society.",,,

Finger foods (foods that can be easily transferred from the plate to the mouth without cutlery) have the potential to increase food intake and enable mealtime independence. However, the components of a well-designed trial evaluating a finger food menu in a hospital are unclear, with little published evaluation of how to implement a finger food menu in hospitals. This study aimed to implement a finger food menu and to evaluate the feasibility of using it in a stroke rehabilitation ward. The feasibility study was a prospective, before-and-after intervention study. Thirty-one hospital inpatients from a stroke ward in a National Health Service hospital in the United Kingdom were included. A finger food menu was offered over two lunchtime meals and compared with the standard lunchtime menu. Feasibility was assessed by evaluating recruitment and retention of patients to the study, feasibility of data collection methods, interrater reliability of plate waste estimations using digital photography and assessing change in food intake. Intervention costs were assessed to support a cost-consequence analysis. Barriers and facilitators to implementation were evaluated through qualitative observations. Thirty-one participants were recruited (mean age 80, SD 8.5). Retention to the study was low, with 40% of patient participants not completing the study. Attrition was due to participants moving from the study ward. Dietary intake measures were successful via plate waste photography with good interrater reliability κ = 0.709 (95% CI: 0.64-0.77). A cost-consequence analysis identified food costs and staff costs as key to delivering the finger food menu. The ward context and use of an internal facilitator to support the delivery of the intervention are important factors to consider. Using finger foods in hospitals for older people after stroke is feasible and warrants a future cluster randomised control trial with minor adaptions to the protocol.",Barnes CJ,Head of Improvement,

Long-term hyperglycemia can lead to severe chronic complications, imposing substantial economic burdens on both society and patients. Despite the availability of various hypoglycemic agents for clinical use, these agents often fail to meet the therapeutic needs of T2DM and its complications. Consequently, there is an urgent need for novel therapeutic strategies and drugs. Lithocarpus litseifolius(L. litseifolius), commonly referred to as &quot;cordyceps on trees&quot;, has a long history of use in traditional medicine and can be applied in tea, sugar, and medicine. Research indicates that L. litseifolius extracts are rich in dihydrochalcones, including trilobatin, phloridzin, and phloretin, which exhibit a range of pharmacological activities, such as anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, hypoglycemic, hypolipidemic, hepatoprotective, and cardioprotective effects. These properties suggest potential applications in the treatment of T2DM and its complications. This review systematically compiled and organized the relevant literature from the past decade on dihydrochalcones(trilobatin, phloridzin, and phloretin) from L. litseifolius extracts. It highlighted recent research progress regarding their role in treating T2DM and its complications through mechanisms such as reducing insulin resistance, regulating glucose transport, improving glucose and lipid metabolism, modulating enzyme activity, regulating gut microbiota, and alleviating inflammation and oxidative damage. The purpose of this review is to provide a reference and basis for future research on the prevention and treatment of T2DM and its complications using dihydrochalcones(trilobatin, phloridzin, and phloretin) from L. litseifolius extracts.",,,

In-depth development of a traditional Chinese medicine(TCM) prevention and control system is of strategic significance to the implementation of the &quot;bone health program&quot;. Focusing on osteoporosis(OP), a representative disease affecting people's bone health, this paper concludes that accelerating the research on the prevention and control of OP by TCM is conducive to enhancing the knowledge and awareness of OP among the public, and it is beneficial to revealing the evolutionary pattern of OP and improving the understanding and management of this disease. Additionally, it can provide an overall framework for and strengthen the systematicity and completeness of the research on the prevention and treatment of OP by TCM. Meanwhile, it can help to explore new research paradigms and optimize the existing research model, so as to promote innovative breakthroughs in the prevention and treatment of bone health-related diseases by TCM. Under the overall layout of the &quot;bone health program&quot;, importance should be attached to the early prevention and the innovation of very early diagnosis and intervention of OP. Emphasis should be put on the discovery of the target network of disease and treatment mechanism for revealing the core pathogenesis of OP and the therapeutic mechanism of TCM. In addition to local lesions of the bone and its clinical outcomes, attention should be paid to the development of multiple metabolic complications. The fusion of advanced interdisciplinary technologies should be promoted for OP and its complications, and thus a research and development system based on clinical application scenarios and driven by big data can be built. The measures above will facilitate the progress in the prevention and treatment of OP and other bone diseases by TCM and provide new momentum for enriching and deepening the research connotation of the &quot;bone health program&quot;.",,,

Consequently, there is little evidence-based guidance for clinicians when choosing an augmentation option for patients with treatment-resistant depression. This trial examined whether it is more clinically and cost-effective to prescribe lithium or quetiapine augmentation therapy for patients with treatment-resistant depression over 12 months. This was a parallel group, multicentre, pragmatic, open-label superiority trial comparing the clinical and cost-effectiveness of lithium versus quetiapine augmentation of antidepressant medication in treatment-resistant depression. Participants were randomised 1 : 1 at baseline to the decision to prescribe either lithium or quetiapine. Six National Health Service trusts in England. Eligible participants were aged ≥ 18 years, met  After randomisation, pre-prescribing safety checks were undertaken as per standard care and trial clinicians decided whether to proceed with prescribing the allocated medication. Trial clinicians received recommendations for titration and dosing in line with current clinical guidelines; however, dosing regimens could be altered according to tolerability and response. Participants were followed up using weekly self-report questionnaires and 8-, 26- and 52-week research visits. The co-primary outcome measures were depressive symptom severity over 52 weeks, measured weekly using the self-rated Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology, and time to all-cause treatment discontinuation of the trial medication. Economic analyses compared costs between the two treatment arms over 52 weeks, from a National Health Service and Personal Social Services perspective, and a societal perspective. Two hundred and twelve participants were randomised, 107 to quetiapine and 105 to lithium. The quetiapine arm showed a significantly greater reduction in depressive symptoms than the lithium arm over 52 weeks (quetiapine vs. lithium area under the differences curve = -68.36, 95% confidence interval: -129.95 to -6.76,  The trial was unblinded, therefore expectancies regarding the trial medications may have influenced the results. Further, there was substantial missing data for some of the secondary outcome measures. As well as being more cost-effective, quetiapine may be a more clinically effective augmentation option for treatment-resistant depression. Examining predictors of treatment response, including clinical, sociodemographic and biological factors, will help establish whether there are additional factors to consider when choosing an augmentation treatment for treatment-resistant depression.

There is some evidence suggesting that adding another type of medication to an antidepressant might be beneficial for reducing depressive symptoms. Lithium and quetiapine are two of the most commonly used treatments in the National Health Service to add on to antidepressants. This study aimed to test whether adding lithium or adding quetiapine was more effective in reducing symptoms of depression, and whether there were differences in how long patients stayed on the added medications. We also compared the cost of the treatments to the National Health Service and to society (e.g. time off work due to health problems). Adults whose depression had not responded to at least two trials of antidepressants at the recommended dose and duration were eligible to take part. Two hundred and twelve participants were included in the study and had an equal chance of being prescribed either lithium or quetiapine. We assessed participants over 12 months, including weekly assessments of their depression and several visits to the hospital. Over the 12-month study period, we found that adding quetiapine to patients’ antidepressant treatment led to a greater improvement in symptoms of depression than adding lithium. There was no difference in how long the two groups stayed on the medications, or the number of side effects: around 50% of those who started taking lithium and 39% of those who started taking quetiapine stopped taking the medication within 12 months, usually due to side effects. Quetiapine provided a greater benefit for patients at a lower cost than lithium. The results suggest that overall, adding quetiapine may be a better option than adding lithium for those who are still suffering with depression after taking two or more courses of antidepressants.",,,

The World Health Organization recommends the use of 7.1% chlorhexidine digluconate gel for newborn umbilical cord care to reduce infection risks. In Ghana, this recommendation has been adopted by the Ministry of Health. However, uptake and adherence to this recommendation are inconsistent. To explore nurses' perspectives on the factors influencing the use of chlorhexidine gel in newborn umbilical cord care in a tertiary referral hospital in Ghana. A qualitative, exploratory, descriptive design was adopted using purposive sampling to recruit 15 nurses with at least six months' experience in neonatal care. Semi-structured, face-to-face interviews were conducted and data were analysed using content analysis to identify the main themes and subthemes. Two main themes and seven subthemes emerged from the analysis. While participants showed good awareness of chlorhexidine gel, there were inconsistencies in their knowledge of its application, largely due to inadequate training. Maternal socioeconomic status and cultural beliefs influenced adherence to use of the gel, with some mothers opting to use traditional substances such as herbal preparations, cow dung and toothpaste instead. Low maternal health literacy and affordability concerns further affected the uptake of chlorhexidine gel. Participants identified the need for structured training programmes and policy interventions to enhance the uptake of chlorhexidine gel. Limited knowledge among healthcare providers, maternal socioeconomic barriers, cultural influences and misconceptions about chlorhexidine gel hinder its widespread adoption for newborn umbilical cord care. Addressing these challenges requires targeted training for nurses, culturally sensitive maternal education and policy interventions such as cost waivers for chlorhexidine gel to promote equitable access. Furthermore, research comparing the effectiveness of the gel versus its aqueous form is recommended to improve acceptance and use in Ghana.",,,

The main objective of this review was to synthesize qualitative and quantitative data from research examining the gut microbiota composition, inflammatory markers, and therapeutic outcomes of interventions targeting the microbiome in the context of ME/CFS. The data collection involved a detailed search of peer-reviewed English literature from January 1995 to January 2025, focusing on studies related to the microbiome and ME/CFS. This comprehensive search utilized databases such as PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science, with keywords including ""ME/CFS,"" ""Gut-Brain Axis,"" ""Gut Health,"" ""Intestinal Dysbiosis,"" ""Microbiome Dysbiosis,"" ""Pathophysiology,"" and ""Therapeutic Approaches."" Where possible, insights from clinical trials and observational studies were included to enrich the findings. A narrative synthesis method was also employed to effectively organize and present these findings. The study found notable changes in the gut microbiota diversity and composition in ME/CFS patients, contributing to systemic inflammation and worsening cognitive and physical impairments. As a result, various microbiome interventions like probiotics, prebiotics, specific diets, supplements, fecal microbiota transplantation, pharmacological interventions, improved sleep, and moderate exercise training are potential therapeutic strategies that merit further exploration. Interventions focusing on the gut-brain axis may help reduce neuropsychiatric symptoms in ME/CFS by utilizing the benefits of the microbiome. Therefore, identifying beneficial microbiome elements and incorporating their assessments into clinical practice can enhance patient care through personalized treatments. Due to the complexity of ME/CFS, which involves genetic, environmental, and microbial factors, a multidisciplinary approach is also necessary. Since current research lacks comprehensive insights into how gut health might aid ME/CFS treatment, standardized diagnostics and longitudinal studies could foster innovative therapies, potentially improving quality of life and symptom management for those affected.",,,dr_khosravi2016@yahoo.com.

The application of SCT aims to restore cognitive functioning in people living with dementia. Beyond pre-clinical studies, several clinical trials have evaluated specific stem cell (SC) types for their efficacy in treating dementia. To assess the status and efficacy of pre-clinical and clinical studies utilizing SCs as a therapeutic approach for dementia. A systematic review was conducted using two electronic databases: MEDLINE and Embase. We reviewed studies on the application of SCs in dementia, focusing on the following aspects: Animal models used in pre-clinical studies, tissue sources of SCs and donor species, and administrative routes and outcome assessments. Included papers comprised randomized control trials (RCTs) and original studies, while those involving adjuvant therapies for dementia were excluded. Quality assessment criteria included relevance to the research question, type of SCs, stage of SC transplantation, duration and route of administration, methods for outcome assessment, and the total number of animals implicated. A total of 32 papers were included, encompassing 21 clinical trials and 11 preclinical studies. The preclinical studies employed various transgenic animal models to evaluate SCT outcomes. Animal models of dementia, particularly transgenic mice, have proven instrumental in replicating human disease mechanisms. These models facilitate understanding of pathophysiology and preclinical testing of therapeutic interventions. Studies utilizing SCT demonstrated notable improvements in spatial memory, reduced neuroinflammation, and protection against amyloid-beta (Aβ) toxicity. Key mechanisms included modulation of inflammation, microglial immune responses, neurogenesis support, and anti-amyloidogenic effects. Preclinical studies predominantly employed human placenta-derived mesenchymal stem cells (PD-MSCs), umbilical cord-derived MSCs (U-MSCs), and induced pluripotent stem cell-derived neuronal precursors. Administration routes varied, with stereotactic and intravenous injections targeting affected brain regions. Reductions in inflammatory markers such as IL-1β, TNF-α, and increases in anti-inflammatory cytokines like IL-4 and IL-10 were observed. These outcomes emphasize the immunomodulatory and neuroprotective capacities of SCT. SCT shows promise in addressing dementia-related pathologies by leveraging diverse therapeutic mechanisms. Continued refinement of preclinical models and translational research is essential to bridge gaps between preclinical findings and clinical applications, potentially paving the way for novel treatments for dementia.",Uwishema O; Ghezzawi M; Wojtara M,Department of Research and Education,uwolivier1@gmail.com.

There have been few controlled studies evaluating the effectiveness of DDI alerts. This study aimed to determine the impact of DDI alerts on rates of DDIs and on associated patient harms. Quasi-experimental controlled pre-post study in five Australian hospitals. Three hospitals acted as control hospitals (EMR with no DDI alerts) and two as intervention (EMR with DDI alerts). Only DDI alerts at the highest severity level (defined as 'major contraindicated') were switched on at intervention hospitals. These alerts were not tailored to clinical context (ie, patient, drug). A total of 2078 patients were randomly selected from all patients (adult and paediatric) admitted to hospitals 6 months before and 6 months after EMR implementation. A retrospective chart review was performed by study pharmacists. The primary outcome was the proportion of admissions with a clinically relevant DDI. Secondary outcomes included the proportions of admissions with a potential DDI and with DDI-related harm. Potential DDIs were identified in the majority of admissions (n=1574, 74.7%) and clinically relevant DDIs identified in half (n=1026, 48.7%). DDI alerts were associated with a reduction in the proportion of admissions with potential DDIs (adjusted OR (AOR)=0.38 (0.19, 0.78)) but no change in clinically relevant DDIs (AOR=1.12 (0.68, 1.84)) or in DDI-related harm (AOR=2.42 (0.47,12.31)). 199 DDIs (76 at control and 123 at intervention hospitals) for 35 patient admissions were associated with patient harm, and 2 patients experienced severe DDI-related harm pre-EMR implementation. Implementation of DDI alerts, without tailoring alerts to clinical context, is unlikely to reduce patient harms from DDIs. Organisations should reconsider implementation of DDI alerts in EMRs where significant tailoring of alerts is not possible. Future research should focus on identifying safe, efficient and cost-effective ways of refining DDI alerts, so expected clinical benefits are achieved, and negative consequences of excessive alerting are minimised.",Hargreaves A; Grant J,Office of the Chief Information Officer; eHealth NSW,melissa.baysari@sydney.edu.au.

We explored influences on decision-making regarding management of COVID-19 ARDS mechanical ventilation to identify modifiable factors to improve preparedness for future pandemics. A systematic review and small group interviews informed the development of an international questionnaire (UK, Italy, Germany and Netherlands) on factors influencing COVID-19 ARDS ventilation decision-making in critical care professionals. Participants ranked four themes in order of importance: disease (uncertainties around COVID-19 ARDS), contextual (cognitive strain), environmental (structural logistics) and team factors. Participants also ranked the subthemes within each theme. Thematic analysis was used to derive findings from qualitative data. Kruskal-Wallis, Mann-Whitney U and Kendall's tau were used for quantitative data analysis. Patient factors (comorbidities, clinical/biochemical parameters) were the most studied influences in the extant literature on decision-making; uncertainty was one of the least studied. 371 critical care professionals responded to the questionnaire. Disease uncertainty (lack of applicable guidelines, unfamiliarity with pathophysiology) was ranked as the most important influence on ventilation decision-making for COVID-19 ARDS across regions, professions and experience levels (p<0.001). Participants expressed underconfidence in their decision-making (median score: 9/20); this was unaffected by experience (p=0.79) or profession (p=0.58). Qualitative findings supported and extended the initial proposed influences, including the impact of team factors (+ve) and resource limitations (-ve) on disease uncertainty.

However, its adoption has been limited due to concerns about cost-effectiveness, significantly influenced by follow-up endoscopy rates (FERs). Understanding CCE's FERs is crucial for its integration into routine clinical practice. We synthesised the evidence to evaluate the overall rate of further investigation in CCE. A systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. Medline, Embase, and PubMed were searched through 15 August 2024. Studies included reporting FERs after CCE, including subsequent endoscopic procedures and radiological imaging. There were no language restrictions or limitations in CCE referral indications, patient recruitment criteria, or pathologies investigated. All studies were independently screened and extracted two times by four reviewers. A random-effects model was used for meta-analysis and meta-regression to identify key contributing factors. 2850 participants from 19 studies were included in the analysis. Compared with the key performance indicators for FERs in colonoscopy (0.10-0.15) and CT colonography (0.25), the pooled FER for CCE was found to be 0.42 (95% CI 0.34 to 0.50). The meta-regression analysis identified complete transit rates and adequate bowel cleansing quality as factors inversely associated with FERs. Furthermore, the CCE2 capsule demonstrated a higher reinvestigation risk than CCE1, likely due to its improved diagnostic accuracy. Although CCE indications were associated with lower FERs, subgroup analysis did not reach statistical significance with high heterogeneity. This study highlights significant FERs for CCE and identifies key contributing factors, emphasising the importance of appropriate patient selection to reduce reinvestigation needs. Future research should focus on improving completion rates, bowel preparation protocols, and refining CCE indications.

Various long COVID symptoms and HRQoL scores at 3, 6, and 12 months following diagnosis were collected from 986 participants. Generalized estimating equations (GEE) were used to explore the association between HRQoL scores evaluated using the short form-8 (SF-8), long COVID symptoms, and baseline clinical characteristics. Patients who had one long COVID symptom showed a significantly lower physical component summary score (PCS) and mental component summary score (MCS) compared with those without any symptoms at all time points after diagnosis. GEE revealed that long COVID symptoms, including dyspnea, fatigue, headache, and muscle weakness, were significantly associated with worse PCS, whereas poor concentration, sleep disorders, fatigue, and headache were significantly associated with worse MCS. Severity-related baseline parameters for patients with COVID-19 were significantly associated with worse PCS scores, although these factors were not significantly associated with worse MCS scores. Long COVID symptoms were associated with lower physical and mental HRQoL. Severe outcomes of COVID-19 impacted PCS but not MCS.",,,hidekit926@gmail.com.

However, little is known about midwives' knowledge, attitudes and beliefs about caring for larger bodied women. Women have reported experiencing weight stigma during interactions with healthcare providers, including midwives. Weight stigma is associated with reduced quality of health and primary healthcare avoidance. In Australia over half of pregnant women are of a higher weight during their reproductive years. To describe what is currently known about midwives' knowledge, attitudes and beliefs relating to caring for larger bodied women across the peripartum period. An integrative review was undertaken, involving a systematic literature search, quality appraisal, and synthesis of findings within the socioecological framework. Sixteen articles were included. Across the socioecological levels: individual level themes related to midwives' attitudes and beliefs and midwives' own body size; interpersonal themes related to communication and relationships; community themes related to the influence of cultural norms; organisation/institutional level themes related to BMI and weight checks, the need for training and education, and the role of healthcare practices and guidelines emerged; finally, at the policy level, system level factors and a weight inclusive approach were identified. This review highlighted that some midwives and student midwives hold negative, stigmatising views towards larger bodied women. Midwives are impacted by their own attitudes and beliefs as well as interpersonal, societal, organisational and system level factors. Efforts to reduce weight stigma require a multi-level socio-ecological approach, including educational strategies aimed at shifting current and future midwives' stigmatising attitudes and beliefs towards larger bodied women.",,,a.robins@student.uq.edu.au.

Although genetic testing has been available and included in Japan's national health insurance since 2016, the number of cases diagnosed with FXS remains low. This study aimed to explore the levels of awareness and understanding of FXS among pediatricians managing developmental delay/ intellectual disability in Japan, particularly between pediatrician with and without clinical genetics certification (or clinical experience with FXS). A survey involving 1217 certified pediatric neurologists from the Japanese Society of Pediatric Neurology and 367 members of the Japanese Society of Pediatric Genetics was conducted. Additional participants were recruited from an online mailing list of 1469 pediatric neurologists. The survey comprised questions on demographics, knowledge about FXS, and genetic testing practices. The responses were analyzed using Chi-square and Fisher's exact tests, and a p-value <0.05 was considered statistically significant. Out of 386 respondents, 326 had experience ordering some kind of genetic testing, including 78 certified clinical geneticists. Knowledge gaps were significant between clinical geneticists and non-genetic specialists. While 20 % of non-genetic specialists were unaware of insurance-covered FXS genetic testing, this percentage was lower among those with clinical experience in FXS cases. Many respondents, irrespective of certification, struggled to determine the indications for requesting FXS genetic testing. Furthermore, non-genetic specialists reported more difficulty providing genetic counseling owing to the psychological burden on mothers. This study highlights the necessity for expanding education and training on FXS among pediatricians in Japan. Addressing these knowledge gaps may enhance FXS diagnostic rates and improve the management of affected individuals and families. Future efforts should focus on strengthening the collaboration between clinical geneticists and general pediatricians and establishing reliable genetic counseling support systems.",,,t-okazaki@okayama-u.ac.jp.
40349380,Novel technique for deltoid spring complex reconstruction in progressive collapsing foot disorder.,,"Foot (Edinburgh, Scotland)",10.1016/j.foot.2025.102171,"Adult Acquired Flatfoot Deformity (AAFD) is a progressive condition characterized by the collapse of the medial foot arch, often caused by posterior tibial tendon dysfunction or deltoid spring ligament incompetency. Flexible type 2 AAFD results in peritalar subluxation and instability. The deltoid and spring ligament complex plays a critical role in foot stability. Current surgical treatments include ligament reconstructions, tendon transfers, and osteotomies, but comprehensive approaches for advanced cases are limited. This study compares two novel techniques-Quadrangular and Triangular repairs-using fiber tape or wire for reconstruction of the deltoid spring complex, combined with medial displacement calcaneal osteotomy (MCDO) for Stage II AAFD. Forty patients (mean age 44.6 years) with Stage II AAFD, unresponsive to conservative treatment, were enrolled between December 2023 and 2024. Both surgical techniques, combined with MCDO (excluding lateral column lengthening), were performed. Clinical and radiological assessments were made preoperatively, at 3 months, and at 12 months. The AOFAS Ankle-Hindfoot scale assessed functional outcomes, while radiological parameters such as Meary's angle, talonavicular coverage, and tibial-calcaneal angle were evaluated. At 3 and 12 months post-surgery, both techniques showed significant improvements in clinical (AOFAS) and radiological outcomes, including Meary's angle and hindfoot alignment (p < 0.01). Triangular repair demonstrated slightly better functional outcomes, but both techniques effectively restored foot biomechanics and alignment. Complications included wound dehiscence, metal irritation, and persistent subtalar pain, which resolved with conservative treatment. Quadrangular and Triangular repair techniques, augmented with fiber tape or wire and combined with MCDO, are effective for Stage II AAFD. Both methods improve clinical and radiological outcomes, with Quadrangular repair showing a slight advantage in functional recovery in severe deformity. These findings suggest that a personalized approach based on talonavicular coverage optimizes AAFD management.",,,jaiswalankit414@gmail.com.

The purpose of this study was to assess the safety and efficacy of a novel synthetic hybrid fabric (SHF) for PVR in adult congenital heart disease. SHF, consisting of bio-absorbable and non-absorbable yarns coated with cross-linked gelatin, was used in a prospective, multicenter, single-arm pivotal clinical trial involving subjects with an age range of 0-59 years. The overall study was registered in the Japan Registry of Clinical Trials (jRCT1080224691). This paper specifically presents a subgroup analysis focusing on five adult patients (aged 18-42 years) from the multicenter trial. The procedures were performed similarly to those using existing products, with no SHF-specific complications observed. The SHF material allowed surgeons to clearly observe the bioprosthetic valve annulus during suturing. None of the patients required blood transfusion or developed adverse events. At a mean follow-up of 4.5 years (range 4.0-4.9 years), no re-interventions or reoperations were needed. SHF shows promise as a patch material for PVR, offering significant benefits such as clear visualization during surgery, which facilitates precise valve placement. This transparency is crucial for adults with repaired TOF, as it helps reduce surgery time and complication risks. This study suggests that SHF could be a valuable material for adult PVR, extending its potential applications beyond pediatric cardiology.",Nishiwaki Y; Kikuchi K,Implantable Medical Device Development Department,hajime.ichikawa.jcho@outlook.jp.

We report the patient-reported outcomes (PROs), focusing on the hormone receptor-positive cohort. Patients were randomized 2:1 to T-DXd (5.4 mg/kg intravenously every 3 weeks) or physician's choice of chemotherapy and prospectively assessed for PRO measures. Change from baseline and time to definitive deterioration (TDD) were calculated from the EORTC QLQ-C30 and QLQ-BR45 and the EQ-5D-5L questionnaires. Baseline global health status/quality of life (GHS/QoL) scores were similar between groups (T-DXd, 331 patients; physician's choice, 163 patients); there were no clinically meaningful changes while on either treatment (median duration: T-DXd, 8.2 months; physician's choice, 3.5 months). Median TDD for GHS/QoL was delayed with T-DXd vs physician's choice (11.4 vs 7.5 months, respectively; hazard ratio, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.52-0.92). Median TDD for all prespecified PROs, including pain, favored T-DXd. In an additional analysis, the median TDD was shorter for nausea and vomiting with T-DXd vs the physician's choice. Trastuzumab deruxtecan maintained GHS/QoL scores despite a longer treatment course compared with standard chemotherapy and delayed definitive deterioration across all prespecified PROs vs the physician's choice. Appropriate management of adverse events and use of preventive measures (ie, antiemetic prophylaxis) may further support patient health-related quality of life.

A descriptive cross-sectional study. The study used an online survey involving 227 healthcare professionals from three public and one private healthcare organisation in Finland. Data was collected using the management of digital competence sharing (MDCS) instrument and analysed using descriptive statistics, independent sample t-tests and one-way ANOVA. Based on the professionals' perceptions, the overall management of digital competence sharing was weak. They perceived the highest level of creation of a friendly and safe digital organisational atmosphere while the lowest level of provision of resources and opportunities for digital competence sharing. Background factors, including gender, age, work experience in healthcare, organisation and clinical environment, showed statistically significant differences in how professionals perceived the management of digital competence sharing. The results emphasised the need for increased managers' attention to digital competence development, prioritising and supporting digital competence sharing among healthcare professionals. The results can be utilised in healthcare management to enhance the digital competence sharing among healthcare professionals and the use of existing digital competence to benefit the work community. The importance of digital competence is increasing among healthcare professionals, but at the same time, they perceive inadequate management support in this area. This study revealed limited management of digital competence sharing in healthcare organisations, particularly among older professionals and those in inpatient and primary care settings.

40349092,Rationale and protocol of the LEAD 2.0 study: a randomized controlled trial assessing the feasibility of a virtually delivered 6-month exercise and nutrition intervention in older adults with subjective cognitive decline (SCD).,,Pilot and feasibility studies,10.1186/s40814-025-01626-4,"With growing prevalence of dementia worldwide, dementia risk reduction is a key interest of the World Health Organization's Global Dementia Action Plan. Subjective cognitive decline (SCD) is a prominent predictor of future dementia diagnosis. Therefore, people with SCD are an important group for dementia prevention intervention. Exercise and healthy diet are associated with a 30-60% decrease in dementia risk in longitudinal studies. Technological advances yield the potential of trials that deliver lifestyle interventions virtually, reaching people in a wide geographical spread. However, the feasibility of large-scale virtual trials still needs to be established. This trial aims to examine the feasibility of a factorial randomized controlled trial exploring a 6-month virtual, exercise and healthy diet intervention. Secondary objectives will examine whether feasibility outcomes vary by gender or technology access. We will recruit 140 older adults (65 + years) with SCD, who will receive a combination of Aerobic and Resistance Exercise (EX) or Stretching and Toning (STRETCH) and either Diet Counseling (DIET) or Brain Health Education (ED). Participants will be randomized to four weekly hours of one of four intervention arms: (1) EX and DIET; (2) EX and ED; (3) STRETCH and DIET; or (4) STRETCH and ED. EX will include moderate intensity aerobic and resistance training. DIET will instruct participants in brain healthy food choices. Assessments will be performed virtually at baseline, 6 months (post-intervention), and 12 months. Feasibility will be measured by recruitment rate, adherence, and retention. Established feasibility will set the stage for a definitive trial. Feasibility results will also inform future virtual programs/services. In the long-term, if the interventions are feasible and beneficial, this intervention model could scale up and spread quickly to reach at-risk individuals for the purpose of dementia risk reduction.

The Patient Driven Payment Model (PDPM) is a new case-mix system developed in the United States of America for classification of skilled nursing facility patients. This study aimed to examine the validity of an adapted version of PDPM for classifying post-acute care patients in China. First, 13,496 post-acute care patients in seven facilities of Jinhua City from January 2018 to December 2020 were sampled and assigned to PDPM groups according to their clinical characteristics, functional status, and special care needs. Then, the effectiveness of grouping was analyzed by the percentage of variance in resource use explained by the classification (R Under the adapted version of PDPM, each patient is classified into a group for each of the four case-mix adjusted components: (1) physical therapy and occupational therapy (PT&OT), (2) speech-language pathology (SLP), (3) nursing, and (4) non-therapy ancillary (NTA). Each component utilizes different criteria for classification. The adapted PDPM explained 11.1%, 6.1%, 14.0%, and 10.6% of the variance in PT&OT, SLP, nursing, and NTA cost per day, respectively, for the sample patients (all p < 0.001), which were similar to the results in the United States of America.

While animal studies suggest a negative correlation between the two, most clinical studies indicate a positive correlation. Therefore, we hypothesize that a nonlinear relationship may exist between eosinophil number and overweight status. This study aims to investigate the association between eosinophil number and overweight status (as well as related indicators) using data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). We utilized data from NHANES 1999-2018, where eosinophil number was obtained from laboratory tests. Overweight status was defined as a body mass index (BMI) ≥ 25. We then applied weighted logistic regression/linear regression, subgroup analysis, and restricted cubic splines (RCS) analysis to investigate the association between eosinophil number and overweight status (as well as related indicators). A total of 77,217 individuals were included in this study, with 38,106 individuals in the non-overweight group (BMI < 25) and 39,111 individuals in the overweight group (overweight and obesity, BMI ≥ 25). The logistic regression analysis revealed a significant association between eosinophil number and overweight status (OR: 2.38, 95% CI: 1.81-3.12, P < 0.001). Additionally, eosinophil number was significantly positively correlated with obesity/BMI/triglycerides and negatively correlated with High-Density Lipoprotein (HDL). Finally, the nonlinear regression results indicated an inverted U-shaped relationship between eosinophil number and overweight status/obesity/BMI. Our study demonstrates an inverted U-shaped relationship between eosinophil number and overweight status/obesity/BMI. Eosinophil number is also significantly associated with HDL and triglycerides. These findings suggest that eosinophils may play a role in overweight (or obesity) and provide valuable insights for exploring the underlying immune mechanisms of overweight status.",,,zhangxixu1987@163.com.

The Saudi Laboratory Licensing Examination (SLLE) is required by the Saudi Commission for Health Specialties (SCFHS) in Saudi Arabia. Success in the SLLE reflects candidates' proficiency in applying their knowledge and skills, serving as an indicator for evaluating the quality of MLS programs. Although preparation strategies for different healthcare licensure exams have been explored, a significant lack of research focuses on SLLE preparation programs for MLS students in Saudi Arabia. This gap became particularly evident when the MLS program at Fakeeh College for Medical Sciences (FCMS) observed a decline in first-attempt SLLE scores for students who graduated in the academic year 2021-2022. To address this research gap and the practical need for improved SLLE performance, this study aimed to develop, implement, and evaluate an SLLE preparation program for MLS interns at FCMS. This program is intended to equip interns with the essential knowledge and skills needed to enhance their chances of success in the SLLE and ensure their readiness for future careers. A quasi-experimental study was conducted from 2022 to 2023 over six weeks at FCMS in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. The study included all 18 MLS interns enrolled in the academic year 2022-2023, utilizing total population sampling. The participants were final-year students in their internship phase. The SLLE preparation program adhered to a structured three-phase conceptual framework: pre-training (planning), training (implementation), and post-training (evaluation). Data were collected through researcher-developed questionnaires adapted from previous studies and reviewed for content validity by medical education experts at FCMS. Reliability was ensured through expert review. Interns' knowledge was assessed with pre- and post-tests. A paired samples t-test was employed to analyze differences between pre- and post-test scores. Data analysis was performed using SPSS version 28, and statistical significance was established at p < 0.05. The study included 18 MLS interns (14 females and 4 males). Level 1 (Reaction): Interns reported high satisfaction with all sessions, with ratings ranging from 94% to 100%.

Tumor cells respond to internal and external stresses, such as hypoxia and nutrient deprivation, by activating the unfolded protein response (UPR) in the tumor microenvironment. This response helps maintain homeostasis, promoting malignant progression, chemotherapy resistance, and immune escape. In this study, single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data from non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients treated with ICB revealed upregulation of thioredoxin (TXN) expression in the epithelial tissues of LUAD (lung adenocarcinoma) and LUSC (lung squamous cell carcinoma) patients with minimal pathological remission. High TXN expression was also associated with ""cold tumors,"" characterized by a lack of T cells and low levels of chemokine receptors and immunomodulators. Experimental results showed that TXN was highly expressed in NSCLC tissues, and its knockdown significantly inhibited the proliferation and migration of A549 and SK-MES-1 cells. Furthermore, TXN knockdown enhanced T-cell-mediated cytotoxicity against these tumor cells, suggesting that TXN contributes to immune escape in NSCLC by promoting tumor cell proliferation and migration while inhibiting immune killing. Notably, TXN knockdown also upregulated CD40 expression, indicating that TXN may regulate immune escape in lung cancer through CD40 modulation.",,,13639908783@139.com.

The virus is characterized by its pleomorphic structure and a single-stranded negative-sense RNA genome. It encodes six structural proteins and three nonstructural proteins. Attachment glycoproteins play a crucial role in allowing the virus to attach to the host cell surface. The matrix protein facilitates the encapsidation of the viral genome and proteins, enabling the formation of mature viral particles. The virus can spread via different routes, including zoonotic spillover and human-to-human transmission. Clinical manifestations include mild respiratory illness and severe and fatal encephalitis. The case fatality rate of Nipah virus infection varies widely, ranging from 40 to 75%, and is regulated by factors such as healthcare availability and quality, the patient's condition, and the virulence of the infecting strain. NiV has been reported in Malaysia, Bangladesh, and India, with fruit bats serving as natural reservoirs. Early detection and prompt response are crucial for controlling outbreaks; however, these efforts are hindered by diagnostic challenges and delayed recognition. The World Health Organization has categorized NiV as a priority pathogen owing to its epidemic potential, recurrent outbreaks, and alarming mortality rates.

Qualitative research with care home managers has explored current practices and specific barriers to accessing dental care services: this has highlighted problems with dentist availability, accessibility and financial concerns. No research has explored reported experiences of DCC implementation in care home settings. This study aimed to explore care home manager's perspectives and preferences on DDC following its wider implementation. The study used a qualitative approach in a constructivist paradigm. Six semi-structured face-to-face interviews were conducted with ten care home managers from a purposive sample of care homes participating in DDC. Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim, and analysed using reflexive thematic analysis. Five major themes were defined. Care home managers preferred DDC to avoid logistical challenges and stress for residents, highlighting the need for on-site dental services. While they wished for reliable partnerships with locally based oral health professionals, this was seen as unrealistic due to their limited willingness to treat care home residents. DDC was valued for its accessibility and support, yet financial concerns were raised due to increasing costs associated with DDC. Managers also emphasized the importance of stable oral care teams within the care home; they noted, however, that this was difficult to achieve due to high staff turnover in long-term care. Domiciliary dental care was widely accepted and appreciated by the care home managers in this study, but increasing costs presented a significant threat to its sustainability.",,,Lynne.janssens@ugent.be.

High-quality research is essential to address these challenges, with recent mandates emphasizing the importance of data sharing for transparency and reproducibility. However, data sharing remains limited across clinical research. Data sharing statements (DSS) have been proposed to improve accessibility, but their implementation and effectiveness in rehabilitation research remain unclear. We aim to identify barriers and guide future policies for standardizing data sharing in the field of rehabilitation. On June 6th, 2024, a PubMed/MEDLINE search identified clinical studies from five top rehabilitation journals based on impact factor. We extracted DSS and general characteristics in a duplicated and masked fashion to identify influential factors on DSS inclusion and then used a hierarchical logistic regression and thematic analysis. Email requests were sent to authors to verify their willingness to share data. Of 1,278 studies that underwent data extraction, 25.5% of studies in our sample featured a DSS; however, this figure was significantly influenced by one journal with a 99% inclusion rate, while the other four journals collectively had only a 5% rate. Further analysis of 314 DSS revealed the majority designated a gatekeeper role for handling data requests. After emailing authors to verify their commitment to the reported DSS, only 22.7% adhered to them. Our study found substantial variation in DSS inclusion across rehabilitation journals, reflecting inconsistencies in how data sharing policies are implemented. We also identified a significant gap between stated data sharing intentions and actual author follow-through. These findings highlight the need for stronger accountability mechanisms. We recommend adopting the Transparency and Openness Promotion (TOP) to provide a framework for data sharing in the field of rehabilitation. Further standardization of DSS is needed, as alternative methods like data repositories have been shown to improve transparency and reproducibility.

Data were collected through individual and semi-structured group interviews, observations and a documentary analysis. They were then coded by two investigators according to two coding trees depending on the population involved. A thematic analysis was then carried out. This case study was composed of 18 interviews, two observations and three documents. They showed that healthcare professionals and healthcare authorities do not share the same vision, issues and expectations regarding prevention. For the former, prevention should be integrated into care as in preventive clinical practices, while the latter are more focused on the healthcare system with a vision based on prevention programs.

Gynecologic tissue biobanks also face some unique challenges. The broad heterogeneity of disease entities encompassed under this domain include common and rare malignancies, each with unique molecular subtypes that must be integrated into biobank information systems. Specimen acquisition extends beyond conventional tissues to include cervicovaginal microbiomes and ascitic fluid. Thus, gynecologic tissue biobanks should develop tailored collection strategies and the establishment of dedicated gynecologic tissue repositories that enable the aggregation of rare specimens through collaborative networks. This article emphasizes the need for high-quality annotation of biospecimens, the incorporation of multi-omics approaches to enhance the translational approaches, challenges associated with integration of high dimensional datasets, the role of biobank networks, and various ethical and cultural considerations concerning gynecologic biobanks.

The aim of this study was to investigate demographic, geographic and socioeconomic disparities in prescriptions for ARNi and SGLT2i for heart failure patients in a universal healthcare system. We used national registers to identify all Danish heart failure patients who were diagnosed on or after the updated clinical guidelines by the European Society of Cardiology (14 July 2016 for ARNi and 27 August 2021 for SGLT2i). Patients were followed until redemption of prescription, emigration, death or censoring on 30 June 2022, whichever came first. The Aalen-Johansen estimator and Cox proportional hazard models were used for individual analysis of ARNi (n=43 625) and SGLT2i (n=2819). The following factors were associated with lack of prescriptions for ARNi and SGLT2i: being women, older age, living alone and being non-native Danish or descendant. HRs ranged from 0.31 (95% CI 0.28 to 0.36) to 0.86 (95% CI 0.80 to 0.93) for ARNi and 0.49 (95% CI 0.41 to 0.58) to 0.93 (95% CI 0.72 to 1.20) for SGLT2i. Prescriptions for both ARNi and SGLT2i showed a social gradient, with the gradient for ARNi being statistically significant.

Oncology,10.1016/S1470-2045(25)00152-4,"Little evidence exists on the effect of risk-reducing surgeries in young BRCA carriers with a previous history of breast cancer. We investigated the association between risk-reducing mastectomy (RRM) or risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy (RRSO), or both procedures, with survival outcomes in a large global cohort of young BRCA carriers with previous breast cancer. The BRCA BCY Collaboration is an international, hospital-based, retrospective cohort study, conducted at 109 centres in five continents, including women harbouring germline BRCA1, BRCA2, or both, pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants and diagnosed with stage I-III invasive breast cancer at the age of 40 years or younger between Jan 1, 2000, and Dec 31, 2020. The primary objectives of the present analysis were to determine the association between RRM or RRSO and overall survival in young BRCA carriers with breast cancer. The primary endpoint was overall survival. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03673306. Between Jan 1, 2000 and Dec 31, 2020, 5290 patients were included, of whom 3361 (63·5%) patients were BRCA1 pathogenic variant carriers, 2708 (51·2%) had node-negative, and 2421 (45·8%) hormone receptor-positive breast cancer. Of 5290 patients, 2910 (55·0%) underwent RRM, 2782 (52·6%) underwent RRSO. After a median follow-up of 8·2 years (IQR 4·7-12·8), RRM was associated with significantly better overall survival compared with no RRM (adjusted HR [aHR] 0·65, 95% CI 0·53-0·78; 20-year restricted mean overall survival time 17·89 years [95% CI 17·61-18·17] with RRM vs 16·65 years [16·38-16·92] without RRM).

40347834,SLK is mutated in individuals with a neurodevelopmental disorder.,,EBioMedicine,10.1016/j.ebiom.2025.105725,"Key to neuronal cell polarization and maturation is proper cytoskeletal organization and function that endows the bipolar neuronal cell with mature dendrites, axons, and functional synapses. Ste20-like kinase (SLK) has been shown to have various cytoskeletal roles. SLK regulates the polarity of microtubules, and its deficiency in the developing murine cortex leads to major defects including impaired development of the distal dendritic tree. No neurodevelopmental phenotypes in humans, however, have been linked to SLK. Clinical phenotyping, positional mapping, exome sequencing and functional analyses using patient-derived cells, SLK knock down cell lines, as well as a Drosophila model of Slik deficiency (the orthologue of SLK). We identified three individuals from three families (two are consanguineous) in whom a neurodevelopmental disorder (NDD) is linked to biallelic variants in SLK. The deleterious nature of these variants is confirmed by their failure to rescue the abnormal synapse maturation and locomotor defects phenotype in a Drosophila model of Slik deficiency. We also recapitulated the previously published abnormal cytoskeletal phenotype using patient cells, which showed abnormal organization of the cytoskeleton with accompanying impairment of migration and polarization. Furthermore, transdifferentiated neurons from patient fibroblasts displayed immature neuronal-like morphology with reduced dendritic arborization. Our results support an autosomal recessive SLK-related NDD and suggest abnormal cytoskeleton-mediated neuronal maturation as the underlying mechanism.

This study examined the prevalence of sensory changes after msTBI and relationships with emotional distress, functional disability, and life satisfaction. A cross-sectional survey was conducted including 387 participants with msTBI (mean years post-injury, 12.8; range = 0.4-35.0 years) and 60 controls, not matched on age and sex but recruited in the same period. Self-reported sensory symptoms were assessed using a custom checklist and the Somatic Symptom Scale-8 (SSS-8). Emotional distress, functional disability, and life satisfaction were measured through the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), 12-Item World Health Organization Disability Assessment Schedule 2.0 (WHODAS 2.0), and Satisfaction With Life Scale (SWLS). We compared the frequency of sensory symptoms between groups and examined associations with demographics, injury factors, and clinical outcomes within the msTBI sample. 70% with msTBI reported experiencing ≥1 sensory changes due to their brain injury, and 35% reported experiencing dizziness in the previous week, averaging 2.2 symptoms in total, which was significantly higher than controls after adjusting for age and sex. Sensory changes were more common in younger participants (light hypersensitivity), females (light and noise hypersensitivity), those with more severe TBI (overall sensory changes, affected vision, reduced smell), and those fewer years post-injury (overall sensory changes, noise hypersensitivity, reduced smell, altered taste, dizziness), though many of these associations did not survive multiple comparison correction. Sensory changes were clearly and consistently associated with worse clinical outcomes, with medium-large effect sizes for emotional distress and functional disability and smaller effects for life satisfaction. Although causality cannot be established, these findings suggest that sensory changes are a clinically significant issue after msTBI, even among individuals more than a decade post-injury on average. This underscores the need for routine assessment and further research on underlying mechanisms and interventions.",,,jai.carmichael@monash.edu.

While algorithms to optimize testing exist for RS/Oncotype Dx, no such efforts have focused on ROR/Prosigna. This study aims to enhance pre-selection of patients for testing using machine learning. We included 348 postmenopausal women with resected HR+/HER2-node-negative breast cancer tested with ROR/Prosigna across four Swedish regions. We developed a machine learning model using simple prognostic factors (size, progesterone receptor expression, grade, and Ki67) to predict ROR/Prosigna output and compared the performance regarding over- and undertreatment with commonly employed risk stratification schemes. Previous classifications resulted in significant undertreatment or large intermediate groups needing gene expression profiling. The machine learning model achieved AUC under ROC of 0.77 in training and 0.83 in validation cohorts for prediction of indication for adjuvant chemotherapy according to ROR/Prosigna. By setting and validating upper and lower cut-offs corresponding to low, intermediate and high-risk disease, we improved risk stratification accuracy and reduced the proportion of patients needing ROR/Prosigna testing compared to current risk stratification.

This qualitative interview study used semi-structured questions and inductive reflexive thematic analysis. Purposeful sampling focused on midwives working in youth clinics in the Stockholm region. Of the 29 youth clinics approached, nine agreed to participate, resulting in 24 midwives participating. Data were collected through semi-structured interviews and analyzed using reflexive thematic analysis by Braun and Clarke's six-phase framework. The findings are presented in three main themes with nine sub-themes. Midwives face challenges in addressing violence, balancing their sense of duty with the need to create a safe environment for youth. Strategies for detecting and asking about IPV varied, with midwives employing different approaches and facing organizational challenges. The need for professional development and clear guidelines was emphasized, highlighting the importance of collegial support and established routines. Youth clinics are essential for identifying adolescents exposed to violence, with midwives ideally positioned to support those affected by IPV. However, midwives face challenges in inquiring about IPV and require appropriate conditions, including tools, training, time, and clear procedures.

The current study aimed to assess the length of diagnostic delay, whether this is changing over time, correlates of longer delay and the importance of diagnosis. This study utilised a mixed methods cross-sectional online survey of people with endometriosis (n = 506). Individuals with self-reported endometriosis were recruited via social media and websites of Australian endometriosis organisations completing an online, cross-sectional survey. Hierarchical multiple regression, ANOVA and template analysis were conducted. Participants reported an average diagnostic delay of 12.3 years (SD = 7.7), with delay appearing shorter in those who first saw a general practitioner (GP) for their symptoms since 2018 (mean 4.7 years, SD = 3.4). More recent endometriosis-related symptom onset, younger age at diagnosis, and accessing medical care through public healthcare were associated with shorter delays, whilst seeing a higher number of doctors prior to diagnosis and queer identity was associated with longer delays. Participants indicated that diagnostic delay most commonly occurs due to dismissal and disbelief by medical professionals and qualitative accounts revealed that receiving a diagnosis is important for many reasons. Diagnostic delay is perceived as a barrier to receiving timely, effective care for endometriosis. Increased societal and medical professional knowledge regarding symptoms indicative of endometriosis, and early treatment and clinical skills focused on pain validation and acknowledgement are recommended to improve timely diagnosis.",Stanley K,Endo Help Foundation,dmosterd@deakin.edu.au.

If apathy increases dementia risk via lifestyle-related dementia risk factors, targeted lifestyle interventions could help high-risk individuals. We used data from the preDIVA study including 3303 individuals aged 70-78 years. Apathy was assessed using the geriatric depression scale, and CVRF (cardiovascular risk factors) (systolic blood pressure, cholesterol, diabetes, body mass index (BMI), smoking, and physical activity) were considered as potential mediators. Outcome was incident dementia during 12 years of follow-up. We assessed mediation using Multiple Mediation Analysis (MMA). Of the association between apathy and dementia (HR 1.49 [95% CI 0.99-2.41]), 27% was mediated by physical inactivity, BMI and diabetes combined. Of this total, physical inactivity mediated 28% of the effect (HR 1.12, 95% CI 1.03-1.29), diabetes 9% of the effect (HR 1.04, 95% CI 1.02-1.10), and BMI counteracted these effects by -12% (HR 0.95, 95% CI 0.88-0.98). The relationship between apathy and dementia is partly mediated by physical inactivity, BMI and diabetes. Apathy is an important clinical marker that signals the existence of potentially modifiable pathways, providing an opportunity for lifestyle interventions. To potentially reduce dementia risk via lifestyle modification in patients with apathy, a tailored approach should be taken to overcome the characterizing symptom of diminished motivation.",Lindhout JE; van Dalen JW; van Gool WA; Richard E; Hoevenaar-Blom MP,Department of Public and Occupational Health; Department of Neurology,

The present study aims to examine the associations of biological aging markers with appetite loss in community-dwelling people aged 21 to 102 years. This retrospective case-control study used baseline data from the INSPIRE-T cohort in Toulouse, France. Each of the 49 cases with appetite loss was sex- and age-matched to two controls without appetite loss (n = 147; median age of 79 years, interquartile range: 19.5; 67% women). Appetite loss was assessed using a single yes-no question from the World Health Organization´s Integrated Care for Older People screening tool. Biomarkers (first- and second-generation DNA methylation-based epigenetic clocks [Horvath, Hannum, PhenoAge, and GrimAge], the inflammatory aging clock iAge, and Adenosine triphosphatase inhibitory factor 1-IF1) were derived from blood samples. Logistic regression analyzed the associations of these markers with appetite loss. In fully adjusted models, accelerated aging using GrimAge was the only biomarker associated with appetite loss (Odds Ratio = 1.21, 95% Confidence Interval: 1.03, 1.43). When stratified by age (≤ 65 years vs. > 65 years) and sex, this association remained significant only in individuals over 65 years and men.

The examination modalities included optical coherence tomography (OCT), microperimetry (MP-3), and focal macular electroretinography (FMERG) with 10-degree and 5-degree stimulus spots under infrared camera monitoring centered on the treated MHs after ART. All three patients showed improved visual acuity after the ART; MP-3 showed relatively good sensitivity around the fixation point with a dense scotoma at the center of the graft. All MHs were closed with autologous grafts and the size of MHs was decreased. OCT revealed clearly visible ellipsoid zones of the host retina around the grafted retina, however one transplanted eye showed disorganized outer layer of the host retina near the border of graft-host retina. FMERGs with the 10-degree stimulus were recorded successfully in all three treated eyes with more than half of a- and b-wave amplitudes of the fellow eyes. FMERGs with the 5-degree stimulus were recorded successfully in two of the treated and their fellow eyes. The FMERGs showed well-maintained macular retinal function after ART.

Smoking is widely recognized as a significant risk factor for this disease.MethodsThis study extracted data on the disease burden of pancreatic cancer attributable to smoking in China from the Global Burden of Disease 2021 (GBD 2021) database. A total of 447 334 individuals were included in the analysis. A joinpoint regression model was used to calculate the annual percentage change (APC) and average annual percentage change (AAPC) to assess trends in the disease burden from 1990 to 2021. The age-period-cohort model was applied to explain the epidemiological trends of the disease by controlling for variables associated with age, period, and birth cohort. Decomposition analysis was conducted to quantify the relative contributions of population growth, population aging, and epidemiological changes. The Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model was utilized to forecast the burden of pancreatic cancer due to smoking in China over the next 15 years.ResultsFrom 1990 to 2021, the age-standardized mortality rate (ASMR) and the age-standardized disability-adjusted life years rate (ASDR) due to smoking-related pancreatic cancer in China exhibited an upward trend.

The mortality and DALY rates increased with age, peaking at approximately 85 years and 70 years, respectively, indicating a substantial burden on the elderly population. Furthermore, we predict that female ASMR and ASDR may start to decline in the next 15 years; however, the absolute burden remains unchanged. Conversely, the ASMR and ASDR for males continue to rise, indicating an increasing burden, with the male burden consistently surpassing that of females.ConclusionsThis study demonstrates that from 1990 to 2021, the burden of pancreatic cancer attributable to smoking in China has intensified, with significant disparities related to sex and age. The future outlook appears quite severe, given the large population base and accelerating population aging. Strong smoking cessation and control measures specifically targeting elderly males are imperative to limit tobacco exposure among high-risk groups, as these measures are crucial for alleviating the burden of pancreatic cancer in China.",,,

This study explores the co-design process of the i-Minds DHI, developed for young people exposed to technology-assisted sexual abuse (TASA), with a focus on advancing PPIE in DHI development. The research team collaborated with a Lived Experience Advisory Group (LEAG) to co-design the intervention, detailing activities, experiences, benefits, challenges and priorities identified throughout the process. The study involved four participatory co-design workshops and focus groups with LEAG members. Key activities included identifying key features of the app design and content, gathering feedback on prototypes, discussing priorities for the app's function and trial design, and refining the language and content of user-facing materials. Features were prioritised using the MoSCoW method. Recruitment of LEAG members, facilitated by the Marie Collins Foundation, emphasised the importance of involving trusted organisations when addressing sensitive topics like TASA, as many young people do not initially recognise themselves as victims. Key findings highlighted the importance of clear communication, structured processes (e.g., Terms of Reference) and financial remuneration for members to promote equity of opportunity. Agile development methods enabled iterative refinement of the app, integrating user feedback in real time. However, time and budget limitations constrained the integration of all desired features, with the MoSCoW method providing transparency in decision-making. We offer recommendations for effective PPIE, including prioritising lived experience input early in research, allocating sufficient resources and fostering transparent communication. Despite challenges, such as limited diversity within the LEAG and remote meeting formats, PPIE was considered meaningful by members. This study provides a valuable framework for co-designing DHIs and improving inclusivity in PPIE efforts, particularly in sensitive research areas like TASA. This study was supported by a LEAG, which undertook the role of partners and was involved in study design, ethical considerations, recruitment, content revision and project oversight. Authors included lived experience members and people with intersecting lived experience and research identities.",Bucci S; Newton A; Whelan P; Cartwright K; Chitsabsean P; Green V; Larkin A; McDonald RF; Selby V; Varese F,Pennine Care NHS Foundation Trust; Mersey Care NHS Foundation Trust; Marie Collins Foundation; Greater Manchester Mental Health NHS Foundation Trust,

Specifically, the frequency of general pain clinic visits and pain clinic psychology visits were contrasted between rural and urban veterans in 2015 and 2022. National VHA administrative data were used to build two cohorts of veterans with an initial pain clinic visit in 2015 or 2022. Number of pain clinic visits and number of pain clinic psychology visits in the following year were calculated. Multivariable regression models examined rural/urban differences in receipt of follow-up pain clinic visits and receipt of follow-up pain psychology visits in both 2015 and 2022, after adjusting for demographic characteristics and psychiatric comorbidity. Veterans with an initial pain clinic visit increased by 22.5% from 2015 (n = 95,549) to 2022 (n = 117,044) and included about one-third rural veterans in both years. Rural veterans had lower rates of follow-up pain clinic visits in 2015 (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]: 0.85; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.82-0.87) and this gap remained, but narrowed, by 2022 (aOR: 0.92; 95% CI: 0.90-0.95). The gap in pain psychology follow-up visits, however, disappeared between 2015 (adjusted incidence rate ratio [aIRR]: 0.88; 95% CI: 0.81-0.95) and 2022 (aIRR: 1.00; 95% CI: 0.93-1.08).

To ease this burden, many countries offer home-based medical services. In Region Halland, Sweden, a mobile team intervention in municipal home care (MHC) was introduced to support frail elderly patients. This study aimed to assess whether the intervention reduced ED visits and hospitalizations among MHC recipients. The study population consisted of all patients aged ≥ 65 years enrolled in MHC in Halmstad, Sweden, from October 2014 - April 2016. Healthcare utilization during the seven months prior to the initiation of the intervention (October 2014 - April 2015) constituted the pre-intervention group and were compared with healthcare consumption during a seasonally matched seven-month period after the launch of the intervention (October 2015-April 2016). The primary outcome was the number of adverse events, defined as unplanned ED visits or hospital admission. Negative binomial regression was used to assess the association between exposure and adverse events, presented as Incidence Rate Ratios (IRRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). A total of 2163 patients were included in the pre-intervention group, and 2197 patients in the intervention group. Both groups had a mean age of 84 years, with no significant differences regarding sex. In the pre-intervention group, 64% had severe comorbidities, compared to 66% in the intervention group. Primary care home visits by physicians increased from an average of 0.9 in the pre-intervention group to 1.1 in the intervention group (p < 0.001). Risk for adverse events was elevated among patients with severe comorbidities (IRR = 3.14, 95% CI: 1.91-5.15, p = < 0.001). There was a slight decrease in the incidence rate for the intervention group; however, this reduction was not statistically significant (IRR = 0.91, 95% CI: 0.82-1.01, p = 0.09). The mobile team intervention in MHC did not significantly reduce ED visits or hospitalizations among elderly MHC recipients, suggesting that physician-led interventions alone may be insufficient to lower acute care utilization in this population. This highlights the complexity of care needs among frail older adults and suggests that a more comprehensive, multidisciplinary approach may be required to achieve meaningful reductions in emergency care use.",Agvall B,Department of Research and Development,karin.ervander@med.lu.se.

Despite the importance of digital health education, consensus on essential primary medical degree content is lacking. Focusing on core competence domains can address critical skills while minimising additions to an already demanding curriculum. This study identifies the minimum essential digital health competency domains from the perspectives of learners, teachers, and content experts aiming to provide a framework for integrating digital health education into medical curricula. We conducted focus groups with students (n = 17), and semi-structured interviews with medical educators (n = 12) and digital sector experts (n = 11) using video conferencing. Participants were recruited using purposive sampling. The data were analysed using framework analysis and inductive thematic analysis to identify common themes. Four core themes and eleven sub-themes were identified and aggregated into four essential competency domains: ""Understand the Local Digital Health Ecosystem and Landscape"", ""Safe, Secure and Ethical Information Literacy and Management"", ""Proficiency in Digital Health Tools and Associated Technologies"" and ""Scholarly Research and Evidence-based Practice"". Medical educator and digital sector expert participants provided the greatest source of data for curriculum content consideration. Students demonstrated varying levels of aptitude, confidence, and interest in technology. Our balanced engagement with learners, educators, and digital health experts enabled the identification of a context-relevant framework for the minimum essential digital health competence domains for graduating medical students. The identification of focused, clinically relevant core competencies makes them amenable to integration into an existing curriculum tailored to local contexts. This approach addresses limitations of restricted curricular space and accommodates varying student interests, confidence and aptitude in technology. The delivery approach should consider a student-centred adaptive modality that takes advantage of advances in artificial intelligence (AI) as an effective pedagogical tool.",,,Rebecca.Grainger@otago.ac.nz.

With the development of social media, TikTok and Douyin were used as important tools for ECC popularization and early screening. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the educational impact from the integrity, accuracy and quality of ECC-related short videos on TikTok and Douyin. We searched for short videos related to ECC on the mobile application TikTok and Douyin on April 15, 2024. The search keywords were as follows: ""Early childhood caries"" on TikTok in both English and Japanese, and Chinese search on Douyin. The first 100 short videos were selected as samples for each group. we applied an instrument called DISCERN, which consisted of 3 sections and a total of 16 questions to evaluate the quality of each short video, and used a checklist to rate the content of videos. The accuracy of the content was evaluated based on the Children's Caries Risk Assessment and Management Guidelines. A total of 115 short videos were assessed for the useful information quality of ECC, including 78 Chinese, 26 English, and 11 Japanese. The score for the content quality of short videos showed that each of the three groups assigned the highest scores to the sections on symptoms and treatment, with Chinese short videos achieving the top ratings. The DISCERN scores for useful short videos in each group were 33.10 ± 3.49 in Chinese, 29.54 ± 2.37 in English, and 28.27 ± 2.61 in Japanese, respectively. Compared with English and Japanese videos, Chinese videos had the highest DISCERN score with significant differences (p < 0.05). Meanwhile, in Chinese short videos, healthcare professionals or organizations uploaded videos with higher DISCERN scores, which were more comprehensive and extensive than those uploaded by private users.

The aim of the Adapted Physical Activity for children treated for Cancer and Insulin-Sensitivity (APACIS) study is to investigate the effects of two exercise programs started as early as diagnosis on metabolic profile and physical health. APACIS is a trial that includes children at diagnosis of all pediatric cancers which are randomly allocated to the Soft group - for low intensity physical activity - or to the Strong group - for mixed, high intensity exercise. Both programs are done at least twice weekly for 30 to 60 min over 6 months, adapted to the health status of the children, with a follow-up of 18 months. The primary objective is the change in insulin sensitivity measured by the Homeostasis Model Assessment of Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR) at 0, 3, 6, 12 and 24 months between the two groups. The secondary objectives include changes in cholesterol, triglycerides and cortisol blood levels, state of undernourishment, cardiorespiratory fitness (based on peak rate of oxygen uptake of the 6 Minute Walk Test), flexibility (sit and reach flexibility test), fat mass distribution (Waist-to-Hip Ratio) and level of physical activity assessed by questionnaire at 0, 3, 6, 12 and 24 months. On-therapy metabolic adaptation in the different patient groups will also be evaluated by an integrated pipeline combining the detection of 150 metabolites, with metabolic pathway enrichment and network mapping. This approach will be complemented by an analysis of intestinal and oral microbiota, to identify the species impacted by treatments and the influence of exercise on these toxicities. The APACIS study investigates the metabolic, motor, and nutritional effects in children with cancers performing low versus high intensity exercise with an innovative approach consisting of early practice since diagnosis. It will contribute to better personalize physical activity prescription during treatment of pediatric cancers.

40346595,Interventions to improve referrals from primary care to outpatient specialist services for chronic conditions: a systematic review and framework synthesis update.,2025-05-10,Systematic reviews,10.1186/s13643-025-02841-z,"Prior systematic reviews highlight that accessing specialist healthcare to treat chronic conditions can be obstructed by variations in referral rates, inappropriate referrals, and poor communication. Structured referral proformas, peer feedback, and educational interventions involving specialists have been identified as successful strategies for improving referral rates and appropriateness. However, the success of such interventions is often dependent on specific clinical contexts, and little is known about the practicalities of implementation. Additionally, with advancements in healthcare delivery, such as e-referral systems, there is a need to explore new interventions and how they address barriers to referral. This systematic review evaluated the updated evidence exploring interventions aiming to improve rates and/or appropriateness of referral from primary care to specialist services in patients with chronic conditions.Five academic databases were searched (CINAHL, MEDLINE, Embase, British Nursing Index, and Public Health Database), and studies published in English between 2013 and 2023 were included. The Joanna Briggs Institute's appraisal tool was used to assess the quality of studies, and a narrative synthesis was conducted using the TiDiER framework (template for intervention description and replication). Eighteen full-text publications and five abstracts were included. A behavioral theory or framework for intervention development was used in seven studies. All interventions were based on primary care, and thirteen studies evaluated a multi-component intervention. Process and system changes were most commonly used to improve referral, including electronic health systems, referral algorithms, collaborative working, and patient direct access. Interventions targeted at patients were the least common. Staff education was often used in addition to process and system changes. When used alone, referral algorithms and staff education were less effective at improving referral rates or appropriateness. Implementation barriers included time constraints, logistical issues, and patients/staff preconceived perceptions of referral necessity. Unsurprisingly, the success of interventions aimed at improving referral practices is based on contextual circumstances, and as with previous reviews, there is no one-size-fits-all approach.Given the challenges highlighted in this review, multi-component interventions addressing referral barriers in both primary and secondary care appear to be a successful way to improve referral practices.

BEAT-SHOCK (BEst Available Treatment for septic SHOCK) registry is a prospective registry consisting of 309 adult patients with septic shock requiring high-dose norepinephrine (≥ 0.2 μg/kg/min). This predetermined analysis included 82 patients treated with PMX-HP. They were grouped according to the median time from intensive care unit (ICU) admission to administration of PMX-HP: the early administration group (n = 40) and the late administration group (n = 42). The primary outcome was short-term hemodynamic status, including mean arterial pressure and vasoactive-inotropic score (VIS; calculated from doses of dopamine, dobutamine, norepinephrine, epinephrine, vasopressin, milrinone, and levosimendan) within 48 h after ICU admission. The median time from ICU admission to administration of PMX-HP was 265 min (interquartile range [IQR]: 113-480). The median ages were 70 (IQR: 59-81) and 72 (IQR: 64-80) years (P = 0.77), and 21/40 (53%) and 25/42 (60%) patients were male (P = 0.52) in the early and late administration groups, respectively.

One burgeoning capability is the collection of social determinants of health (SDOH) data and using that information to provide social care. This study describes the information infrastructure and technological capabilities developed by community health centers (CHCs) and examines the factors influencing SDOH data integration and management in primary care practice. It offers health care leaders insights and strategies to build capacity for managing social care and quality. An observational design was used to examine the technological capabilities of CHCs in Michigan via a practice survey, and factors related to developing information infrastructure were qualitatively explored. The practice survey, semi-structured interviews, and national health center data were analyzed. Sociotechnical systems and organizational theories were used to develop the survey and interview guide. A sample of Michigan CHCs (n = 15) was recruited for the study. The practice survey was administered to CHC leaders, clinicians, and staff (n = 27). Semi-structured interviews (n = 25) were then conducted to explore infrastructural, organizational, and technological factors associated with managing social care and information. Michigan CHCs developed capabilities to exchange patient information with state and local partners. Data were typically shared with maternal and infant health (n = 5, 33.3%), mental health (n = 5, 33.3%), substance use (n = 6, 40%), domestic violence (n = 6, 40%), and food assistance (n = 6, 40%) providers, but CHCs did not develop the same capabilities with all social services examined. The interviews revealed that CHCs leveraged health care and government investments in information technology (IT) as a strategy to share data and address quality. The survey results revealed that CHCs developed the ability to use SDOH data to manage population health and provide value-based care. IT used to manage social care and address quality is necessary but insufficient in primary care settings.

However, the scarcity of reported cases with confirmed sources limits the ability to evaluate and manage VAP, which remains a major challenge for healthcare systems globally. Pathogens were isolated from endotracheal aspirate (ETA) samples of VAP patients using conventional culture techniques. Whole-genome comparisons, based on average nucleotide identity (ANI), were performed to identify genetically identical strains by comparing pulmonary isolate genomes with gut metagenome-derived bacterial genomes. Mouse models of pneumonia and colitis were used to validate the translocation of pathogenic bacteria from the gut to the lungs. Metagenomic analysis was performed to characterize the gut microbiome and resistome. Pathogenic isolates were obtained from the ETA samples of seven VAP patients, with one isolate per sample. Among these, Escherichia coli (Ec1) and Burkholderia cenocepacia (Bc1) from two patients were genetically identical to strains in their respective gut microbiota, with ANI values above 99%, indicating gut-to-lung translocation. The Ec1 strain demonstrated increased resistance to cefazolin while remaining susceptible to gentamicin, amikacin, and kanamycin, compared to previously reported pneumonia-associated E. coli strains. The Bc1 strain showed elevated resistance to macrolides, chloramphenicols, and tetracyclines relative to pneumonia-associated B. cenocepacia strains. Metagenomic analysis revealed a highly individualized gut microbiota composition among VAP patients. Notably, the translocated bacteria were not dominant within their gut microbiota. Additionally, these patients showed a marked increase in the total abundance of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in their gut microbiota. The translocation ability of the Ec1 strain was validated in a mouse pneumonia model, where it caused more severe lung damage. Furthermore, elevated levels of Escherichia-Shigella were detected in the lung tissues of colitis mice, suggesting that gut-to-lung bacterial translocation may occur in a severely inflamed host, potentially leading to pneumonia. This study demonstrates the gut-to-lung translocation of E. coli and B. cenocepacia, highlighting their role in the development and progression of VAP in ICU patients. These findings provide valuable insights for implementing targeted prevention and treatment strategies for VAP in ICU settings.",,,maodq@nankai.edu.cn.

Like any measurement instrument, a PROM should be valid, reliable, and responsive. Adequate content validity relies on patient input, while construct validity can only be ensured by Modern Test Theory (MTT) models. Inadequate PROMs induce a significant risk of measurement errors. Currently, there is no thorough analysis of PROMs used in clinical research on idiopathic adhesive capsulitis (AC). The aim was to identify all PROMs used to evaluate AC, analyze their content and construct validity, and summarize the results in a recommendation on which PROM is the best for trials on AC. Musculoskeletal PROMs used to evaluate patients with AC were identified through PubMed searches in November 2024. Development and validity studies were identified for each PROM. Content validity was assessed based on existing guidelines emphasizing the involvement of patients in the development. Construct validity was assessed based on existing guidelines emphasizing the use of MTT models in the analysis. Both content and construct validity were rated from 1 to 5, and a concluding, aggregated assessment was made. 16 different PROMs, used up to 45 times, were identified. 79 articles on measurement properties were identified and analyzed. None of the PROMs had been developed specifically for patients with AC. Four PROMs were developed by the involvement of patients but with other conditions than AC. Five PROMs had been validated with an MTT model. However, all five possessed inadequate content validity. Hence, it was not possible to identify any PROM with adequate content and construct validity for patients with AC. An adequate PROM for idiopathic AC does not exist and a new condition-specific questionnaire is needed. The existing PROMs should be used with significant reservations and results obtained by these PROMs should be interpreted with caution.",,,kalle2312@gmail.com.

However, high rates of implant failure were more frequently observed in obese patients (body mass index < 30). The study aimed to determine the potential reduction in implant failure rates by adding an anterior symphyseal plate in obese patients (class I). The study was designed as a prospective, randomized controlled trial with a single-blind methodology, conducted at a level 1 trauma center. The study involved 36 patients with Tile C1-2 and C1-3 injuries, and class I obesity between February 2022 and May 2023. All cases had posterior and anterior ring fixation, with 18 cases having superior symphyseal plating and 18 cases having additional anterior plating (Groups A and B). The primary outcomes were radiological, functional outcomes, and implant failure rates. Patients in group A were followed up for an average of 13.39 months, and those in group B for 13.7 months. Group A exhibited a significantly shorter operative time with a mean difference of 30 min (p < 0.001), as well as lower reoperation rates (p = 0.03). Both groups had similar final clinical and radiological outcomes (p = 0.44 and 0.78) and implant failure rates (p = 0.18) at the last follow-up. The authors found that using a single high-quality symphyseal plate effectively addresses symphyseal diastasis in vertically unstable Tile C1-2 and C1-3 pelvic ring injuries among patients with class I obesity. This method lowers morbidity by reducing operation times and minimizing reoperation rates, while the inclusion of an additional anterior plate does not enhance the final radiological and clinical outcomes.

40346460,A randomized controlled trial adding behavioral counseling to supervised physical activity in people living with and beyond cancer (BOOST-UP-): a study protocol for a live remotely-delivered behavior change intervention.,2025-05-10,BMC cancer,10.1186/s12885-025-13904-8,"For many people living with and beyond cancer (LWBC), physical activity (PA) declines significantly after supervised PA interventions. The effect of short-term, supervised PA interventions on motivational outcomes and longer-term PA in people LWBC is limited, especially theoretically-based approaches to identify key motivational outcomes for behavior change. The purpose of this study is to compare the effects of a 6-month virtual supervised PA group plus standard exercise counseling (PA + EC) versus a virtual supervised PA plus motivationally-enhanced behavioral counseling (PA + BC) group on moderate-to-vigorous intensity PA (MVPA) in people LWBC. This study is a two-armed, multi-site randomized controlled trial (RCT). People LWBC will be recruited and randomized to a 6-month virtual supervised PA intervention plus standard exercise counseling (PA + EC group; n = 118) or a 6-month virtual supervised PA plus behavioral counseling based on the Multi-Process Action Control (M-PAC) framework (PA + BC group; n = 118). Supervised PA will be delivered via synchronous Zoom classes that tapers to a home-based protocol at the end of the study. The goal of both groups is to gradually increase PA to the cancer PA guidelines (e.g., 90 min of MVPA/week). The PA + BC group will receive twelve behavioral counseling sessions with a qualified exercise professional (QEP), and the corresponding counseling session will be delivered bi-weekly. The behavioral counseling sessions will be based on the M-PAC's reflective, regulatory, and reflexive processes. In addition to the supervised PA classes, the PA + EC (i.e., attention control group) will receive twelve standard PA counseling sessions based on PA training principles. People LWBC will complete measures at baseline, midpoint, post-intervention (6-months), at 6-months follow-up, and 1-year follow-up. Self-reported measures include quality of life (QoL), motivational outcomes, health economics, and patient satisfaction. Objective measures include PA via accelerometry. Multilevel modelling will examine change in the primary (i.e., PA) and secondary outcomes (i.e., motivational outcomes from the M-PAC, physical function, QoL) at the five time points. This study will create greater understanding on efficacious programming to support PA maintenance that can be used by clinical and community-based organizations as a low-cost, supportive care tool to improve health outcomes for people LWBC.

In response to the increasing demand and the limited availability of donor organs, there has been a global concerted effort to increase the use of less optimal donor kidneys in suitable recipients. During this complex allocation process, organ acceptance decision-making is the final step. Transplant nephrologists are typically the gatekeeper of this process and make the ultimate decision regarding organ suitability for the intended patients. However, with considerable evidence suggesting the value of shared decision making, engaging patients, caregivers and their primary nephrologists prior to accepting the allocated organ, ensures the healthcare decisions align with the patients' values and their preferences. To tackle this challenge, we developed a visualisation guided simulation-based tool to assist shared decision-making. We have shown that the three-dimensional clinical information required for organ acceptance can be represented using an intuitive and user-friendly interface. By utilizing our published allocation simulation process, simKAP, this decision support system called Kidney Transplant Support System has the capacity to forecast a sequence of potential kidneys offered to a candidate on the waiting list, with the provision of estimated waiting time, donor quality and the expected post-transplant patient survivals for each consecutive offer. Implementation of this tool may inform shared decision-making and reduce organ discards.",,,jean.yang@sydney.edu.au.

Treatment strategies for HCC are multimodal and largely depend on the disease stage, liver function, and individual patient factors. Based on the WHO's VigiAccess database, this study employed a retrospective descriptive analysis of adverse drug reaction (ADR) reports associated with four widely used tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) for HCC, including Sorafenib, Cabozantinib, Lenvatinib, and Regorafenib. The analysis included demographic data such as patient age, gender, and geographical distribution, alongside clinical information on the systems and symptoms associated with ADR reports. A total of 112,975 ADR reports related to the four TKI-targeted drugs were identified. Sorafenib exhibited the highest ADR reporting rate (30.7%), followed by Cabozantinib (29.4%), Lenvatinib (24.5%), and Regorafenib (15.4%). The odds ratio method was employed to assess the statistical correlation between the use of these targeted drugs and the occurrence of ADRs. Notably, Sorafenib (3,746) and Regorafenib (2,496) served to have the highest number of reported palmar-plantar erythrodysaesthesia syndrome. Chi-square analyses suggested that ADRs related to Lenvatinib were reported significantly more frequently in female patients compared to their male counterparts. The findings of this study can enhance public awareness of drug-related adverse events and provide an evidence-based foundation for prioritizing the management of ADRs associated with TKIs in second-line HCC therapy.",,,1264528702@qq.com.

Although CTOs are used internationally in most high-income nations, CTO use in Australia is very high compared with world standards. CTOs are a contentious issue in mental health practice. While they aim to protect both consumers and society, they often interfere with personal freedom and trust between consumers and mental health professionals. International and Australian research is inconclusive about the effectiveness of CTOs in achieving their clinical aims. Australian research overwhelmingly reports consumers' experience with CTOs as coercive and distressing. Families generally support CTOs but are unhappy with certain aspects of the process. Consumers and families' feelings about CTOs often depend on how much they trust the mental health team, the support they receive, and the relationship between the consumer and mental health professional. Health professionals experience significant challenges balancing therapeutic care with their role carrying out CTOs. Local treatment culture, problems in the mental health system and staff attitudes also influence how CTOs are used. There is a lack of recent and high-quality guidance to inform CTO decision-making for mental health professionals. This perspective paper is presented as a narrative literature review, which proposes that if CTOs are used in clinical practice, close consideration towards how and why they are implemented is warranted.",,,

Thus, we developed the Breast Cancer Treatment Application (app) for patients and practitioners to use throughout the cancer care continuum. The app facilitates virtual assistance, delivers educational resources, collects patient-reported outcome measures and provides individualised support via volunteer e-coaches. Among newly diagnosed patients with breast cancer, we will compare changes in patient activation, other patient-reported outcomes and health service outcomes over 1 year between those using the app and Fitbit, and those receiving standard care and Fitbit only. This randomised controlled trial will include 200 patients with breast cancer seen at a tertiary care cancer centre in Ontario, Canada. The intervention group (n=100) will use the app in addition to standard care and Fitbit for 13 months following diagnosis. The control group (n=100) will receive standard care and Fitbit only. Patients will complete questionnaires at enrolment, 6 and 12 months post-diagnosis to measure patient activation (Patient Activation Measure-13 score), distress, anxiety, quality of life and experiences with their care and information received. All patients will also receive Fitbits to measure activity and heart rate. We will also measure wait times and number of visits to ambulatory care services to understand the impact of the app on the use of in-person services. Ethics approval was obtained on 6 January 2023.

A systematic review.,2025-05-10,BMJ open,10.1136/bmjopen-2024-093620,"In high-income countries (HICs), migrants living with HIV (MLHIV) are more likely than other HIV subpopulations to encounter problems which hamper their adherence to the care process; these include social and administrative insecurity, discrimination and psychological distress. This systematic review aimed to determine the specific features of adherence to the HIV care process among MLHIV in HIC. Three researchers independently selected studies from a search for papers focusing on empirical studies on MLHIV's adherence to the care process in HIC, published between 1 January 2010 and 1 November 2024 in the following databases: MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, PsycINFO and Google Scholar. The three dimensions evaluated for adherence to the care process were adherence to treatment, retention in care and virological response. HICs were characterised according to the World Bank's definition. Of 601 studies screened, 69 were included (26 (38%) analysing treatment adherence 44 (64%) 44 (64%) retention in care and 34 (48%) virological response). In 49 (71%) of these studies, MLHIV from sub-Saharan Africa accounted for the majority of persons included. MLHIV were mainly categorised according to their geographical region of origin. Only one study considered the reasons for migration. Of 52 statistically significant associations, only five found that being a migrant (vs being a non-migrant) was associated with a better HIV care process. Moreover, several individual (sociodemographic, clinical and psychological), and structural (care system organisation and political) factors associated with difficulties in adhering to the HIV care process were identified. MLHIV living in HIC had poorer adherence to the HIV care process for all three dimensions studied (ie, treatment adherence, retention in care and virological response). Research studies categorise MLHIV according to their geographical origin. However, this type of categorisation does not adequately capture social inequalities in health. To overcome this, studies must instead categorise MLHIV according to various intersecting factors, including, among other things, their reason for migrating, the length of time living in the destination country and violence experienced during their migratory journey.

It is the leading cause of direct maternal deaths globally and continues to be a major cause of mortality in the UK. Oxytocin is the standard first-line treatment for atonic PPH. The PPH rate is increasing, and this may be partially related to the overuse of oxytocics in labour. Laboratory studies on myometrium suggest that repeated use of oxytocics leads to the saturation of oxytocin receptors and reduced therapeutic efficacy of oxytocin. Carboprost (a prostaglandin analogue) is usually reserved for second-line management of atonic PPH. A systematic review comparing the efficacy of carboprost and conventional uterotonics for PPH prophylaxis found that carboprost was associated with less blood loss, but around 15% of women experienced side effects. The study's aim is to compare intramuscular carboprost with intravenous oxytocin for the initial treatment of PPH. In addition, to assess the cost-effectiveness of both treatments, participants' views on the two treatments and the consent process. COPE is a double-blind, double-dummy, randomised controlled trial that aims to recruit 2000 women (1:1 allocation, stratified by mode of birth) across 20 hospitals in the UK. Due to the emergency nature of PPH, COPE uses a research without prior consent (RWPC) model. Randomisation and treatment will occur if eligibility criteria are met once bleeding starts.

Yet, the underlying neurobiological mechanisms of such proactive effects on emotional processing remain elusive. In the current double-blinded, pharmacologically-manipulated study, 36 male adults (DXM group) received cortisol-repressive dexamethasone on the previous night, then performed the Emotional Face Matching Task (EFMT) during fMRI scanning the next afternoon. Relative to the placebo group (31 males), the DXM group exhibited lower accuracy in the emotion matching condition (p < 0.01), but not in the sensorimotor control shape matching condition. ROI-to-voxel psychophysiological interaction (PPI) analyses revealed significant task-by-group interaction involving the right and left amygdala, but not the medial orbitofrontal cortex (MOFC) or hippocampus. Specifically, the DXM group exhibited stronger functional connectivity between the right amygdala and left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (lDLPFC) during emotion matching (p < 0.001) but reduced connectivity in the same network during shape matching, as compared to the placebo group (p = 0.023). Meanwhile, the DXM group exhibited weaker left amygdala-right posterior middle temporal gyrus (rMTG) connectivity than the placebo group during shape matching (p < 0.001), but there was no group effect in the connectivity during emotion matching (p = 0.392). These results indicate that the CAR proactively prepares fronto-limbic functional organization for emotion processing in male adults. The findings support a causal link between CAR and its proactive effects on emotional processing, and suggest a model of CAR-mediated brain preparedness where CAR sets a tonic tone for the upcoming day to actively regulate neuroendocrinological responses to emotionally charged stimuli on a moment-to-moment basis.",,,shouwen_zhang@163.com.

Despite recent significant therapeutic advances, the prognosis for RB remains unclear owing to late diagnosis and resistance to conventional treatments. This review comprehensively explores the multiple roles of ncRNAs-microRNAs (miRNAs), long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs), circular RNAs (circRNAs), and PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs)-in RB pathogenesis. miRNA dysregulation serves as the initial cascade for modulating cell proliferation, apoptosis, and metastasis. Similarly, lncRNAs demonstrate dual behavior, functioning either as oncogenic drivers or tumor suppressors by interacting with several molecular targets and interacting with different signaling pathways, such as the PI3K/Akt and Wnt/β-catenin pathways. Additionally, circRNAs, owing to their persistent stability and unique ability to act as miRNA sponge main binding sites, affect various normal physiological processes, influencing tumor progression and chemoresistance. Emerging data also highlight the intricate crosstalk between piRNAs and other ncRNAs in retinal homeostasis and oncogenesis, with promising future implications for their utility as diagnostic biomarkers in liquid biopsy types. This comprehensive review consolidates the latest knowledge on the molecular mechanisms of noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) in retinoblastoma (RB), along with in silico analysis of ncRNA-gene interactions, providing a guide for precision medical approaches.

This increases macrophage sensitivity to cytotoxic oxysterols and leads to more vulnerable atherosclerotic plaques with enlarged necrotic cores in a mouse model of atherosclerosis. In humans, analysis of 187 carotid plaques reveals a positive correlation between LPCAT3/ELOVL5-generated phospholipids-including arachidonate (C20:4 n-6)-containing ether lipids-and more stable plaque profiles.

Structural insufficiency fractures in this area lead to severe pain, loss of ambulation, and impaired quality of life. Surgical reconstruction is challenging due to poor bone quality, complex anatomy, and often prior radiotherapy. We report the case of a 36-year-old woman with a history of metastatic breast cancer who presented with acute right hip pain and inability to walk following a fall. Imaging revealed a metastatic insufficiency fracture of the right acetabulum involving the roof and both columns. The patient had a prior history of pelvic radiotherapy. A two-stage hybrid reconstruction was planned to optimize mechanical support while minimizing postoperative complications. This case highlights the complexity of surgical decision-making in metastatic acetabular insufficiency. Various techniques exist, including cementoplasty, tripod fixation, Harrington reconstruction, 3D-printed implants, and pedestal prostheses. Each has unique advantages and limitations depending on lesion extent and patient factors. In our case, a staged hybrid approach (plate fixation, followed by Harrington + tripod + cemented THA) provided durable reconstruction without complications at 24 months follow-up. Hybrid reconstruction offers a viable and effective option for managing complex metastatic periacetabular insufficiency fractures, particularly in previously irradiated patients.

They thought midwives were well suited to perform this task, had good knowledge of women's health and were used to working from a holistic and salutogenic perspective. The midwives perceived certain conditions as essential, structured menopausal counselling, support in the organisation, education at advanced level and established cross-professional collaborations. They also thought an investment in menopause care is needed to promote equal care. This work indicates that midwives with their skills and working methods are well suited to conduct menopausal counselling and thereby could satisfy a healthcare need. Resources needed are investments in menopausal counselling visits by midwives.",,,anette.lycke@med.lu.se.
40344684,Development and validation of an instrument to assess the perception of competencies and level of preparedness in telehealth.,2025-05-10,Medwave,10.5867/medwave.2025.04.3032,"There is a need for a validated instrument that assesses the perception of competencies and the level of preparedness of professionals and technicians who perform telehealth care in Chile. To develop and evaluate the reliability and validity of an instrument designed to measure the perception of competencies and the level of preparedness in telehealth. An instrument on telehealth competencies and level of preparedness was designed, obtaining content validity through expert judgement. The instrument was then administered in 2023 to a total of 83 healthcare professionals and technicians with telehealth experience. To determine construct validity, exploratory factor analysis was conducted, extracting factors using Principal Axes and estimating the number of factors by combining Horn's Parallel Analysis and scree plot. Rotation was performed using the Oblimin method. To estimate reliability, Cronbach's Alpha statistic was calculated. The factor analysis identified items with loadings over 0.6, resulting in a final scale of two factors with a total of 31 items. This factorial model explained 75.5% of the total variance. The first factor brings together items assessing perceptions of telehealth competencies, and the second factor assesses perceptions of the level of telehealth preparedness. Both factors show adequate reliability indicators, with Cronbach's Alpha of 0.98 and 0.97 respectively, and present correlations considered adequate. The instrument has adequate psychometric indicators, even considering the sample size, to measure the perception of competencies and level of preparation in telehealth in health professionals and technicians in the Biobío region. The two factors that make up the instrument help identify training and education needs. It is suggested to extend the validation to samples from other regions and to increase the diversity of clinical disciplines.

Retrospective cross-sectional analysis of routine hospital administrative data (i.e. Hospital Episode Statistics-Admitted Patient Care records) for adults admitted to non-specialist hospitals in England 2017-18. AW admissions were associated with digestive, circulatory, respiratory, and endocrine disorders and were of short duration (median 3 days). Of the 19 588 completed AW admissions examined in 2017-18, 3957 (20.2%) resulted in readmission within 30 days. The strongest predictors of 30-day readmission were being no fixed abode (Adjusted Odds Ratio (AOR) 1.81, 95%CI 1.44-2.26), prior discharge against medical advice (AOR 1.57, 95%CI 1.40-1.77), and greater Charlson comorbidity index total score (AOR 1.02, 95%CI 1.02-1.03). AW 30-day admissions are common and associated to complex case presentations that require high levels of community support on discharge. Hospital-based alcohol teams should prioritize strategies, which maximize medically managed AW, effective transitions to specialist community care including outreach teams and strong collaborations with physical and mental health outpatient services. Together with specialist initiatives within community mental health teams, assertive outreach, and homeless services 30-day readmissions may be minimized. Routine hospital administrative data were analysed to explore associations with demographic and clinical variables and readmission to hospital within 30 days for those treated for alcohol withdrawal. Predictors of 30-day readmission were being of no fixed abode, prior discharge against medical advice and greater levels of comorbidity.",,,

This systematic review evaluates the effectiveness of case management interventions in improving caregivers' positive mental health, psychological distress, and satisfaction with health care services. We included (cluster) randomized controlled trials that evaluated the effects of case management. Systematic searches were conducted in PubMed, Scopus, CENTRAL, and PsycINFO up to 30 June 2024. Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane tool (RoB 2), and multi-level meta-analyses were performed for post-intervention outcomes, while follow-up data were synthesized qualitatively due to limited long-term evidence. A total of 17 studies were included, providing multiple effect estimates for different types of outcomes, showing small positive effects of case management on mental health (analyses based on 8 studies), psychological distress (6 studies), and satisfaction with health services (9 studies). Although case management interventions show promise in supporting carers, the limited number of studies limits the strength and generalizability of the findings. Further research is needed to explore the long-term effectiveness of such interventions. Trial Registration: The review protocol was prospectively registered at PROSPERO (CRD4202453375).",,,

However, real-world safety information on pertuzumab remains limited. This study assessed the safety of adding pertuzumab to trastuzumab-based therapy for HER2-positive breast cancer using real-world data. VigiBase, the World Health Organization's global database of adverse events (AEs), containing reports from November 1967 to December 2023, was used. Signals for pertuzumab-associated AEs in breast cancer cases were detected using the reporting odds ratio (ROR). Signals of trastuzumab plus pertuzumab relative to trastuzumab alone were detected in gastrointestinal disorders (ROR: 1.45, 95% confidence interval: 1.26-1.67), including diarrhoea (3.49, 2.83-4.30); infections and infestations (1.54, 1.24-1.91); and skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders (ROR: 1.63, 1.40-1.90), including pruritus (1.96, 1.51-2.55) and rash (1.63, 1.20-2.23). Further, signals of trastuzumab plus docetaxel plus pertuzumab relative to those of trastuzumab plus docetaxel were detected in gastrointestinal disorders (1.63, 1.38-1.93), including nausea (1.72, 1.24-2.39) and vomiting (1.48, 1.01-2.17), and in nervous system disorders (1.50, 1.20-1.87), including paraesthesia (2.60, 1.33-5.08) and peripheral sensory neuropathy (5.94, 1.79-19.71).

40343901,COVIVA: Effect of transcutaneous auricular vagal nerve stimulation on fatigue-syndrome in patients with Long Covid - A placebo-controlled pilot study protocol.,2025-05-10,PloS one,10.1371/journal.pone.0315606,"Up to 80% of patients who develop coronavirus disease-2019 (Covid-19) infection subsequently experience long covid/post-covid syndrome. The World Health Organization (WHO) has estimated that >770 million patients have been infected with Covid-19 globally. Even if only 10% of these patients develop long covid, > 75 million patients will suffer for a long period. Among the various symptoms of post-covid syndrome, fatigue is common, affecting up to 60% of the patients. As observed in other viral infections, elevated levels of inflammatory cytokines may play a role. Transcutaneous auricular vagal nerve stimulation (taVNS) is a noninvasive method that modulates the immune system via the central nervous system and has shown promising effects in autoimmune diseases and improving fatigue. In this pilot study, we investigated the feasibility of daily taVNS in patients with long covid-related fatigue. Additionally, the effects of taVNS on fatigue and quality of life will be analyzed. A total of 45 adult patients with long covid associated fatigue syndrome will be enrolled in this study, and will be randomized to the above-threshold-stimulation, below-threshold-stimulation, or sham-stimulation arms, after being informed that they will feel the stimulation. The above-threshold-group will receive a 4-week-long left-sided cymba conchae taVNS with 25 Hz, 250 µs pulse width 28s/32s on/off paradigm for 4 h throughout the day. The below-threshold group will receive stimulation below the sensational threshold, whereas the sham group will receive no stimulation following application of a non-functional electrode. The daily stimulation protocol will be recorded either manually or using the provided app. Three well-established questionnaires, the Multidimensional-Fatigue-Inventory-20, Short-Form-36, and Beck-Depression-Inventory, and the newly established Post-Covid-Syndrome-Score will be completed both before and after 4 weeks of stimulation. The primary endpoint has been set as the patients' average daily stimulation time after 4 weeks, while secondary endpoints include the effects of taVNS on fatigue and Quality of Live (QoL). As a non-invasive treatment option, taVNS may be a notable alternative for patients with post-covid related fatigue. This study was approved by the local ethics committee (23/7798) and registered (DRKS00031974) (see supporting information files). The ethical justifiability of this study was supported by prior research demonstrating the safety of taVNS. Patients will be recruited by general practitioners, and written informed consent will be obtained. All data will be pseudonymized for collection and storage. The study results will be published in peer-reviewed journals with the aim of providing evidence of the potential of taVNS in long covid management. The study will be conducted in accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki.",,,

Scalable models of care may help surmount this barrier. To test whether a combined patient and clinician intervention increased the rate of advance care planning (ACP) documentation in large health care systems. This stepped-wedge cluster randomized clinical trial using an open cohort design included patients aged 65 years or older with advanced cancer seen at oncology clinics in 3 health care systems located in the US South, Midwest, and Mid-Atlantic regions from April 1, 2020, to November 30, 2022. Data collection ended in 2024. The intervention involved delivering brief evidence-based patient-facing video decision aids available in 25 languages as well as goals-of-care communication training to oncology clinicians. Patients in the control period received usual care. The primary outcome was ACP documentation, which included any electronic health record documentation of a goals-of-care conversation, palliative care, hospice, or limitation of life-sustaining treatments, identified via a validated natural language processing program. Analysis was performed on an intention-to-treat basis. Twenty-nine practices, comprising 13 800 unique eligible patients with a total of 29 357 repeated measurements, were included (mean [SD] age, 74.5 [6.6] years; 52.3% men [15 344 of 29 357 measurements]). The proportion of patients with ACP documentation was greater in the intervention phase compared with the usual care phase (adjusted rate difference, 6.8% [95% CI, 2.8%-10.8%]; P < .001). ACP documentation in the intervention phase occurred among 3980 of 15 754 patients (25.3%) (goals-of-care conversation, 21.4% [3377 of 15 754]; palliative care, 9.6% [1517 of 15 754]; hospice, 5.4% [847 of 15 754]; and limitation of life-sustaining treatments, 7.2% [1128 of 15 754]). In comparison, ACP documentation in the usual care phase occurred among 2834 of 13 603 patients (20.8%) (goals-of-care conversation, 16.8% [2281 of 13 603]; palliative care, 9.5% [1287 of 13 603]; hospice, 5.3% [724 of 13 603]; and limitation of life-sustaining treatments, 8.4% [1149 of 13 603]). In this stepped-wedge cluster randomized clinical trial for older adults with advanced cancer, a bundled evidence-based decision aid and communication training intervention increased the proportion of older patients with ACP documentation. This approach offers an innovative paradigm with a clinically meaningful increase in ACP documentation, a widely used quality metric that reflects high-quality patient-centered care delivery.

Accurate classification within longitudinal cohort studies is crucial for understanding disease progression and for the comparability and collaboration across studies. The main objective of this systematic review was to identify and compare the diagnostic criteria used in prospective population study cohorts centering on the Alzheimer's disease clinical continuum in older adults. A review was performed of cohort studies started in the year 2000 or later, with a follow-up duration of at least 3 years among people aged between 50 and 85 years old living in the community. Original studies were searched in MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane, PsycINFO, and Web of Science. Two independent reviewers agreed on the final selection of 28 studies covering 25 cohorts. One study was identified by three independent judges as having methodological limitations due to inadequate reporting as per the modified NIH quality assessment tool. Data was extracted from each included study using a standardized extraction form. In general, the studies followed fewer than 1500 participants. The results showed convergence in the choice of diagnostic classification criteria among the 25 cohorts studied especially for the later stages of AD, while criteria for the earliest stages showed greater variability. Only five cohorts studied were concerned with the follow-up of the full spectrum of the disease.

We performed external validation, ensuring its applicability to patients undergoing robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP). Therefore, we also compared the external validation for the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) nomogram. We collected the data for 8194 patients who underwent RARP at Daimonji Clinical Application Database Group (Dai-CAD) as the validation cohort and performed the external validation using this cohort. The primary endpoint was the accuracy of the MSUG nomogram, and the secondary endpoint was comparison with the MSKCC nomogram. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and area under the curve (AUC) were calculated to quantify the accuracy of the nomogram at predicting pT ≥ 3. A calibration plot was performed to evaluate the extent of over- and underestimation. Locally advanced PCa was diagnosed in 677 of 2530 patients (26.8%) in the MSUG cohort and 1472 of 5799 patients (25.3%) in the validation cohort. The ROC curve for the validation cohorts fit to the MSUG nomogram and the MSKCC nomogram, with AUC of 0.66 and 0.65, respectively. For calibration plots, it overestimated the risk of locally advanced PCa when probability thresholds are over 70% in the MSUG nomogram, while it may overestimate when probability thresholds are over 30% in the MSKCC nomogram.

Two published transcriptome datasets involving mouse oxygen-induced retinopathy (OIR) model data were selected from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. iDEP (integrated Differential Expression and Pathway analysis) were used for differential expression analysis. Gene Ontology (GO)-based functional and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analysis were performed. In this study, a total of 1742 proteins were quantified from the two groups. 55 differentially expressed proteins closely related to immune and angiogenesis processes were identified, including 33 highly expressed as well as 22 lowly expressed in the ROP group. Combined with RNA-seq data from OIR model, we screened two particularly critical proteins, LYN and filamin A (FLNA), which were both expressed at significantly elevated levels. According to the findings of the tear proteomics data, we hypothesized two particularly critical proteins, LYN and FLNA, may serve as pivotal regulators of immune and angiogenesis processes in ROP.

Data was collected from patients who underwent level I polysomnography (PSG) in the sleep laboratory at Hospital Rainha Santa Isabel, Torres Novas, Portugal, between January 2018 and December 2022. The patients' medical data was analyzed and sociodemographic (gender, body mass index (BMI) and age), polysomnographic (Apnea and Hypopnea Index (AHI), mean SpO2, minimum SpO2, Oxygen Desaturation Index (ODI), T90 and T85) and laboratory data (hematocrit (HCT), hemoglobin (HGB) and erythrocyte count) were collected. Statistical analysis included one-way ANOVA with Tukey's HSD for pairwise comparisons, Pearson's correlation for associations between polysomnographic and hematological parameters, and multivariate regression to identify independent factors. HCT levels were found to be higher in the moderate OSA group, particularly compared to the no OSA group (42.34 ± 4.09% vs 40.28 ± 2.75%), with significant differences between groups (p = 0.032). Although HCT levels were shown to be higher in the OSA group, the mean values remained within normal range, so no patient manifested erythrocytosis. Our results suggest that moderate OSA is associated with increased HCT levels but does not seem to cause secondary erythrocytosis.

While significant brain plasticity occurs due to the pathology and surgical intervention, the mechanisms underlying cognitive functioning in the remaining hemisphere remain poorly understood. This multiple-case study longitudinally investigates neurocognitive reorganization in childhood after left hemispherotomy for RE and identifies structural patterns in the right hemisphere associated with language recovery. Indeed, the mechanisms that allow the right hemisphere to support language, after left hemispherotomy remain unclear. Cognitive trajectories were analyzed in three RE patients, and their cortical thickness (CT) changes were compared with data from a publicly available cohort of 393 healthy subjects. Language neuropsychological scores and T1-weighted MRI data were assessed in the healthy right hemisphere before hemispherotomy, one year, and five years post-surgery. Specifically, principal component analysis, structural covariance, and graph theory approaches were employed to investigate language network organization in patients and controls. Results reveal diverse language recovery trajectories among the three patients. Regarding CT, three potential signatures associated with favorable language outcomes were identified: (1) normal or below-normal CT values in cortical regions; (2) a more associative and integrative organization of the language network; and (3) increased global efficiency. These preliminary longitudinal findings provide novel insights into the mechanisms of neurocognitive reorganization following left hemispherotomy in childhood. By emphasizing structural patterns linked to favorable postoperative language recovery, this study highlights their value for guiding future research and clinical interventions.",Borne A; Perrone-Bertolotti M; Bulteau C; Cousin E; Roger E; Baciu M,Univ.

Qualitative data were collected through focus group discussions (FGDs). We used a rapid qualitative inquiry approach, incorporating a combination of Rapid Research, Evaluation and Appraisal Lab sheet, the Rapid Identification of Themes from Audio recordings, and mind-mapping techniques for data synthesis, analysis, and interpretation. The framework approach was applied to structure and explore the qualitative data for triangulation across FGDs. Five FGDs were conducted with 22 potential implementers (doctors, nurses, physio/occupational therapists, and community partners) between July and August 2023. We identified 24 CFIR determinants covering five domains (innovation, outer setting, inner setting, individuals, and implementation process). Enablers included intersectoral collaboration (partnership and connections), trialability (innovation trialability), alignment with overarching goal (mission alignment), and removal of hurdles and sufficient support (tailoring strategies). Barriers included complexity (innovation complexity), affordability (innovation cost), tradeoffs (relative priority), synergy among multiple programs (compatibility), resource intensity (available resources), fragmented understanding of the care model across providers (communication), physical spaces' design (physical infrastructure), limited time and resources (innovation deliverers' opportunity), gaps in clients' capability (capability), and non-compliance (motivation). Policy contexts and directives (policies and laws), theoretical benefits (innovation evidence base), comprehensiveness and patient-centeredness (design), enhanced service access (relative advantage), proposed task allocation (work infrastructure), information access (information technology infrastructure), capability building (access to knowledge and information), innovation deliverers' capability, motivation, and accessibility (innovation recipients' opportunity) were both barriers and enablers. The findings demonstrated agreement with the innovation and suggested implementation readiness at clinical and service levels. However, addressing key barriers and leveraging existing enablers are necessary for successful adoption and implementation.",Wang SZ,Family Medicine,

However, research on this topic remains limited. This study evaluates the usability of digital neuropsychological assessment tools and examines healthcare professionals' perceptions of their reliability and efficiency in clinical settings. A cross-sectional observational study was conducted at the Centro Neurolesi ""Bonino-Pulejo."" Healthcare professionals, including neuropsychologists and clinicians, were asked to alternate between digital and traditional paper-based assessments. The usability of the digital tools was measured using the System Usability Scale (SUS), while qualitative feedback was gathered through open-ended questions. A panel of 29 healthcare professionals participated in the study. The quantitative analysis of the SUS scores revealed a mean score of 89.48 ( Although the study's single-center design, small sample size, and reliance on self-reported measures may limit the generalizability of the findings, the results underscore the high usability and effectiveness of digital neuropsychological assessments. Healthcare professionals reported improved efficiency, accuracy, and data organization, supporting the tool's potential integration into clinical practice. These findings underscore the promise of digital tools in modern neuropsychology, paving the way for future multicentric and longitudinal research to validate their broader applicability.",Maggio MG; Giambò FM; De Pasquale P; Quartarone A; Calabrò RS,Neurorehabilitation Unit,

40343047,A Qualitative Study on the Design and Implementation of a First Responder Operational Stress Injury Clinic.,,Health services insights,10.1177/11786329251333019,"First responders (police, firefighters, and paramedics) are routinely exposed to potentially psychologically traumatic events (PPTE). While the prevalence of mental disorders is difficult to estimate, research has demonstrated that first responders report higher rates of mental health disorders than the general population. They also report significant barriers to accessing mental healthcare, including concerns about the confidentiality of mental health services and stigma by co-workers and organizational leadership. One way to address these barriers to seeking care is through the establishment of a first responder specific mental health clinic. The objective of this qualitative study was to assess how to best implement such a service for first responders in Ottawa, Canada. We conducted 14 in-depth semi-structured qualitative interviews with key interest holders from first responder services, unions/associations, and the Workplace Safety and Insurance Board (WSIB) which explored elements of service delivery and organizational barriers and facilitators to implementing the clinic. Interviews were analyzed and coded using thematic analysis by two independent coders. Four main themes were identified: implementation context (perceived need, workplace culture), design of the clinic (service delivery, confidentiality, cost, and communication about the clinic), the implementation process (barriers and facilitators to implementation), and the broader impact of the implementation of the clinic. Findings show that it is the right time to implement first responder specific clinical services as services begin to prioritize the mental health needs of their members. To increase uptake by first responders, confidentiality and cultural competency of care providers is paramount.",,,

Decision Curve Analysis (DCA) is a method for measuring clinical utility for binary outcome models over a range of risk thresholds. While the utility of polytomous outcome models can be assessed by applying DCA to different dichotomizations of their categories, no method exists to synthesize the binary measures into a single value. This paper illustrates DCA for polytomous outcomes and extends its concepts to develop a summary utility measure for polytomous outcome models. We apply this method to three ordinal logistic regression models, including the NIRUDAK and DHAKA models for predicting dehydration severity in patients over and under five years of age, respectively.

In this review, we comprehensively describe the cell biology of podocytes under healthy conditions and in glomerular disorders wherein podocyte injury is a major pathological mechanism. First, the molecular mechanisms that maintain podocyte actin cytoskeleton structure, permanent cell cycle exit, and metabolism under healthy conditions are described. Secondly, the mechanisms of podocyte injury, including genetic alterations and external insults that ultimately disrupt podocyte actin cytoskeleton dynamics or interrupt podocyte quiescence and mitochondrial metabolism are discussed. This understanding forms the basis of described potential therapeutic agents that act by modulating dysregulated podocyte cytoskeleton organization, prevent or reverse cell cycle re-entry, and re-establish normal mitochondrial energy production. Lastly, the application of modern techniques such as single cell RNA sequencing, super resolution microscopy, atomic force microscopy, and glomerular organoids is improving the resolution of mechanistic podocytopathy knowledge. Taken together, our review provides critical insights into the cellular and molecular mechanisms leading to podocyte loss, necessary for the advancement of therapeutic development in glomerular diseases.",,,

40342642,Paraoxonase 1 Enzyme Activity in Patients With Isolated Coronary Artery Ectasia.,,Cureus,10.7759/cureus.83703,"Paraoxonase 1 (PON1) is an organophosphate ester hydrolase associated with high-density lipoprotein (HDL). The recently emphasized function of PON1 activity is its antiatherogenic activity. PON1 is always found together with HDL in plasma, and PON1 is responsible for the protective effect of HDL against low-density lipoprotein (LDL) oxidation. Considering this role in cardiovascular diseases and its antioxidant properties, PON1 activity may be a valuable biomarker in predicting coronary artery ectasia (CAE), whose pathogenesis has not yet been fully elucidated. The aim was to reveal the relationship between PON1 activity and isolated CAE. This prospective case-control study's population comprises 5240 patients who underwent coronary angiography between December 2009 and April 30, 2010. Thirty patients with isolated CAE (Group CAE) and 25 volunteers with normal coronary arteries (Group Control) who met the inclusion criteria were included in the study. The sociodemographic, clinical, and anatomical characteristics and lipid profiles of the patients were analyzed. Groups CAE and control were compared in terms of PON1 activity levels. There was no significant difference between Group CAE (n=30) and Group Control (n=25) in terms of sociodemographic and clinical characteristics (p>0.05). There was ectasia in a single coronary artery in 19 patients (63.3%). The right coronary artery (RCA) was ectasian in 17 patients (38.6%) and was the most affected vessel. According to the Markis classification, the most common type of ectasia was type IV ectasia, which was seen in 14 patients (46.7%). When lipid profiles were compared, no difference was observed between the groups. PON1 activity levels were significantly lower in the CAE group than in the control group (Group CAE=127.5 U/L; Group Control=177.0 U/L; p<0.001). This study's findings suggest a significant correlation between low PON1 activity levels and the development of isolated CAE, suggesting that PON1 activity may play a potential role in the pathophysiology of CAE. Based on the association demonstrated between isolated CAE and PON1 activity in our study, future research may investigate the potential use of PON1 as a biomarker.",,,

This study examined bilirubin metabolism and systemic biomarkers as indicators of metabolic vulnerability in individuals with IED. Laboratory data for total and indirect bilirubin and white blood cell (WBC) count were analyzed in individuals with IED and a demographically and clinically matched general population (GP) control group. A 10:1 nearest-neighbor propensity score matching procedure was used to balance covariates including age, sex, race, ethnicity, body mass index (BMI), and alcohol and tobacco use. Participants with hepatobiliary or inflammatory conditions were excluded to reduce heterogeneity and confounding. Group comparisons used unique individuals with biomarker values averaged across timepoints. Individuals with IED showed lower total and indirect bilirubin levels compared to matched controls, with a moderate effect size for indirect bilirubin (d = -0.37) and a small effect for total bilirubin (d = -0.10). WBC differences were minimal (d = -0.12). Linear mixed-effects models incorporating repeated measures yielded consistent results, though none of the group differences reached statistical significance, likely due to limited sample size in the IED group. Sensitivity analyses suggested bilirubin findings were more robust to unmeasured confounding than WBC. These results highlight a potential hepatobiliary or metabolic signature in IED, rather than a primary inflammatory process. Given the preliminary nature of the findings, absence of cytokine data, and limited statistical power, results should be interpreted cautiously and warrant replication in larger samples with broader inflammatory and lifestyle profiling.",,,

Despite improvements in life expectancy and quality of life due to medical progress, children and adolescents (under the age of 20 years) with Down syndrome still face higher mortality rates. Future research is essential to elucidate the epidemiological patterns and trends in Down syndrome among children and adolescents, enabling the development of effective prevention and intervention strategies to improve survival and health outcomes. This study draws on Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2021 mortality data for children and adolescents with Down syndrome. Pearson's correlation coefficient was leveraged to assess the relationship between Down syndrome mortality and the Socio-demographic Index (SDI). The estimated annual percentage change (EAPC) in mortality was calculated to track temporal trends, and the Bayesian age-period-cohort (BAPC) model was employed to forecast future mortality. Over the past 42 years, there have been fluctuations in mortality among children and adolescents with Down syndrome. Globally, deaths have decreased by 22.8% from 26.95 thousand (95% uncertainty interval [UI], 10.10-74.66 thousand) in 1980 to 20.81 thousand (95% UI, 14.18-36.49 thousand) in 2021. Furthermore, BAPC model projections indicate a sustained reduction in mortality for children and adolescents with Down syndrome. Predominantly, deaths occur in 0-4 age group, with higher death rates in Low SDI regions, and notably, the number and rate of female patients exceed those of male patients. Intriguingly, a negative correlation was observed between death rates and higher SDI. Most countries have seen a decline in Down syndrome deaths among children and adolescents over the last 42 years, but a few high SDI countries are witnessing an increase. Future health interventions should prioritize these countries, focusing on resource allocation, infrastructure, and health education. Continued efforts on care for the 0-4 age group with Down syndrome are crucial to further reducing deaths in this age group.",,,

Each patient's gross tumor volume (GTV), lung, cord, heart, and esophagus were contoured manually by radiation oncologists and automatically by Adapt Anatomy on replanning computed tomography (rCT) images. The structures were also contoured on cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) images obtained on the same days as the rCT images, using Adapt Anatomy. The structural volumes contoured using Adapt Anatomy were compared with those contoured by the radiation oncologists. The dice similarity coefficient (DSC) and overlap index (OI) were calculated for each structure. Additionally, the DSC and OI calculated for the GTV on the CBCT images were compared with the values calculated from the rCT images. The automatic contour volumes for all of the structures did not differ significantly from the manual contour volumes, except for heart and esophagus volumes. The DSC and OI values for all of the structures were >0.8, except for the esophagus. The DSC and OI values for the esophagus were 0.73±0.070 and 0.68±0.10, respectively. The DSC and OI values calculated for the CBCT images did not differ significantly from those calculated for the rCT ones (p=0.208, 0.401, respectively). Adapt Anatomy showed sufficient accuracy compared to the other software solutions, and we concluded that there is a possibility that Adapt Anatomy may be useful for performing ART on CBCT images. However, careful reviews by radiation oncologists are warranted in clinical cases because its accuracy varies significantly in certain structures such as the esophagus.",Iwai Y,Research Physics,
40342483,Management of Extensive Hepatic Metastases From Adenoid Cystic Carcinoma of the Parotid Gland by Embolization and Hemi-Hepatectomy: A Case Report.,,Cureus,10.7759/cureus.81860,"Adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC) is a rare malignancy of the salivary glands characterized by slow growth, perineural invasion, and a predilection for distant metastasis, primarily to the lungs and bones. Liver metastasis from ACC is uncommon and poses significant diagnostic and therapeutic challenges. This report presents a case of mixed type of ACC (predominantly cribriform and tubular architecture with a solid component of 20%) originating in the parotid gland with multiple liver metastases from a tertiary center in India. A 32-year-old woman initially underwent a total conservative parotidectomy with facial nerve preservation and adjuvant radiotherapy for ACC of the right parotid gland in 2017. Immunohistochemistry was positive for CD117, S100, and smooth muscle actin (SMA). Following a recurrence of metastatic neck lymph node involvement in 2020, she underwent right modified radical neck dissection and additional radiation therapy. In 2024, surveillance imaging revealed liver lesions, confirmed as ACC metastases by biopsy with immunohistochemistry. Due to inadequate hepatic reserve for a right hemi-hepatectomy, a right portal vein embolization was performed to induce hypertrophy of the left liver. Subsequent right hemi-hepatectomy with segment II metastatectomy achieved an R0 resection, and the patient experienced an uneventful recovery. She remained disease-free six months postoperatively. ACC accounts for 1%-2% of all head and neck cancers and exhibits distinct clinical and pathological features. Its treatment is centered on surgical resection with adjuvant radiotherapy, although the efficacy of chemotherapy is limited. Liver metastasis, though rare, can be managed with surgical intervention in selected cases, potentially improving survival outcomes. This case underscores the importance of long-term follow-up for ACC patients due to the risk of delayed distant metastases. It also highlights the role of multidisciplinary management and individualized treatment strategies in achieving optimal outcomes in rare and complex clinical scenarios.",,,
40342468,Comparison of Adverse Events Among Angiotensin Receptor Blockers in Hypertension Using the United States Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System.,,Cureus,10.7759/cureus.81912,"Background Angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) are pivotal in hypertension management. Despite sharing a common mechanism of blocking angiotensin II receptors, ARBs exhibit varying pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties that influence safety profiles. ARBs have been linked to adverse events (AEs) across multiple organ systems, including skin (e.g., angioedema), neurological (e.g., dizziness), and cardiovascular disorders (e.g., hypotension). Understanding these differences is essential for optimizing clinical decision-making. Objectives This study compared AE profiles of seven ARBs in patients with hypertension using data from the United States Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS). To enhance result reliability and control for confounding factors, only cases where ARBs were explicitly indicated for hypertension treatment were included. FAERS is a valuable post-marketing surveillance tool that captures spontaneous AE reports, although it has limitations such as reporting bias. The findings aim to generate hypotheses regarding ARB-associated AEs for future research using robust study designs. Methods A retrospective analysis of FAERS data between 2004 and 2024 was conducted. Patients prescribed ARBs for hypertension were included, while those with missing prescription indications or alternative uses were excluded. Reporting odds ratio (ROR) and adjusted ROR (aROR) were calculated to compare reporting proportions (RPs) among ARBs, with each ARB sequentially used as the reference in pairwise comparisons. The Bonferroni correction addressed multiple comparisons, with an adjusted significance level of 0.05/21=0.0024. For aROR calculations, cases with unknown values in adjustment variables were excluded. To enhance robustness, results were considered significant only when both ROR and aROR showed significance. Results Using losartan as the reference, valsartan, irbesartan, candesartan, telmisartan, and olmesartan demonstrated significantly lower RPs for skin disorders. For instance, the RP for skin disorders was 10.6 for losartan compared to 6.1 for valsartan (ROR: 0.545, p<0.0001; aROR: 0.648, p<0.0001) and 4.2 for olmesartan (ROR: 0.368, p<0.0001; aROR: 0.412, p<0.0001). Conversely, valsartan and olmesartan exhibited significantly higher RPs for cardiovascular disorders, with 23.7 for valsartan (ROR: 1.574, p<0.0001; aROR: 1.570, p<0.0001) and 19.0 for olmesartan (ROR: 1.186, p<0.0001; aROR: 1.278, p<0.0001) compared to 16.5 for losartan. Similar trends were observed when other ARBs were used as references, revealing a heterogeneous distribution of AE profiles among the seven ARBs. Conclusions This study reveals distinct AE patterns among ARBs in hypertension management. No single ARB exhibited universally favorable safety profiles across all AE categories, emphasizing the need for personalized prescribing. When selecting an ARB, prescribers should consider patient-specific risk factors and comorbidities. For instance, patients with a history of skin disorders may benefit from ARBs other than losartan. Conversely, patients with elevated cardiovascular risk may require closer monitoring when prescribed valsartan, including more frequent follow-up visits or additional cardiovascular diagnostics to detect early AEs. These findings enable healthcare providers to tailor ARB selection and monitoring strategies to optimize efficacy and safety in hypertension treatment.",,,

This study aims to describe the epidemiological and clinical profile of heatstroke patients admitted to our centre during a heatwave period. A total of nine cases were recorded during the study period. All patients were male, aged between 35 and 63 years, with the majority working in occupations involving direct exposure to sunlight. The majority of the patients presented with seizures and altered sensorium, with temperatures exceeding 105°F in most cases. Blood investigations revealed leukocytosis, thrombocytopenia, and multi-organ dysfunction. Creatine phosphokinase (CPK) levels were invariably high in all patients, and arterial blood gas analysis revealed high-anion-gap metabolic acidosis (HAGMA). Treatment measures given include cooling measures, inotropes, and supportive care. The case fatality rate was 55%, highlighting the severity of the cases. As global temperatures rise and heatwaves become more frequent due to climate change, heatstroke is progressively emerging as a major public health issue. Risk factors such as occupational sun exposure, comorbidities, and extreme temperatures contribute to heatstroke incidence and severity. Urgent public health strategies are needed to mitigate heatwave impacts and protect vulnerable populations. Further research into novel treatment approaches may improve outcomes for heatstroke patients.",,,

However, their success is influenced by multiple factors. This study aimed to evaluate the failure rates of IZCs and identify key predictors, including age, sex, implant placement characteristics, loading protocols, inflammation, mobility, bone density, and oral hygiene. Understanding these factors can help optimize treatment strategies and improve implant survival rates. This prospective, cross-sectional observational study was conducted at the Department of Orthodontics from August 2022 to December 2024. Sixty patients requiring IZC implants were enrolled, with the systematic exclusion of those with systemic conditions affecting bone metabolism. The implants (Dentos Absoanchor, 12/14 mm length, 2 mm diameter) were placed at an insertion angle of 0-90 Of 60 implants, 18 (30%) failed. Patients aged > 18 years had a higher failure rate (~35%) than those aged < 18 years (~25%), while females exhibited a greater failure rate than males. Implants placed at 0-45 IZC implant failure is multifactorial, with mobility, inflammation, and poor oral hygiene emerging as critical risk factors. Although bone density played a role, implant placement characteristics significantly influenced success. Clinicians should prioritize optimal insertion angles (45-90",,,
40342458,Optimizing Cardiovascular Outcomes in Type 2 Diabetes: Early Initiation of Dapagliflozin and Sitagliptin From a Cardiologist's Perspective.,,Cureus,10.7759/cureus.81858,"Cardiovascular (CV) disease (CVD) risk is greater in patients with diabetes mellitus and is the major contributor to disability and premature mortality compared to those who do not have diabetes. The clinical implications of CVD in people with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) have increased the emphasis on concurrent treatment to prevent the onset of CVD through personalized management for glycemic control and CVD risk management. Key opinion leaders, comprising 98 cardiologists from across India, participated in seven advisory board meetings held in various cities to explore the challenges and strategies for the early initiation of fixed-dose combinations (FDCs) of sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) and dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors (DPP4i) with a focus on the combination of dapagliflozin and sitagliptin in addressing the CVD risks in patients with T2DM and high risk for CV complications. The expert group discussed the available literature evidence from the clinical trials, systematic reviews, and real-world studies on the benefits of FDC of SGLT2i and DPP4i and FDC of dapagliflozin and sitagliptin to provide rational and practical guidance for its optimal use in addressing the CVD risks in patients with T2DM. The expert group emphasized the importance of timely glycemic control and early initiation of combination therapy of FDC of SGLT2i + DPP4i in T2DM with CVD risks. Addressing multiple pathophysiological aspects of T2DM is crucial, and considering combination therapy with SGLT2i and DPP4i may be pertinent in this context. Combining dapagliflozin and sitagliptin in FDC to target multiple pathophysiological pathways for T2DM appears to have several glycemic and extra-glycemic benefits. This practical guidance document provides valuable insights from leading cardiologists that would support clinicians in selecting the synergistic combination SGLT2i + DPP4i (dapagliflozin + sitagliptin) FDC as an appropriate treatment choice in early intensive therapy in managing people with T2DM and CVD risk for better patient outcomes. The expert opinion in this guidance builds on the established guideline recommendations on FDC of SGLT2i and DPP4i.",R R; Sathe S; Pednekar A; Prasad A; Kesarkar R,Cardiology; Scientific Services; Diabetes and Endocrinology,

Artificial intelligence (AI)-driven tools like ChatGPT (OpenAI, Inc., San Francisco, CA, USA) offer potential support in education, monitoring, and decision-making. However, research on its effectiveness in DM self-management remains limited, particularly in Saudi Arabia, necessitating further investigation into its role and impact. This study aims to analyze the impact of ChatGPT on DM self-management. A qualitative experimental design was adopted in this study. DM patients after interacting with ChatGPT for a week participated in the interviews, where their perceptions on its impact were recorded. A total of 25 DM patients participated in the study, whose results were analyzed using thematic analysis. The analysis of interview data revealed 11 themes related to the impact of ChatGPT on DM self-management, which included informational support, personalized recommendations, motivation and support, assistance in decision-making, offering self-care reminders, facilitating communication with healthcare providers, facilitating peer support, providing mental health support, tracking and monitoring, conducting health assessments, and education and awareness.

Remdesivir and favipiravir are approved to treat COVID-19 and are used as single agents in the Ministry of Health (MOH) protocol. However, there is limited research available on the effectiveness of their combined use. The aim of this cross-sectional study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of remdesivir and favipiravir in reducing disease severity, hospitalization duration, and mortality rates among high-risk patients who have been hospitalized with COVID-19. A retrospective, cross-sectional study was conducted in adult patients who were treated with the MOH treatment protocol. The study period was from January 2021 to January 2022, and it included 47 patients treated with favipiravir or a combination of remdesivir and favipiravir. The study included patients with high-risk characteristics and excluded pediatric and pregnant patients. In a study of 47 hospitalized COVID-19 patients, all admitted cases presented with at least one COVID-19 symptom. The frequency of symptoms such as fever, cough, chest pain, shortness of breath, and fatigue was noted to be, respectively. The median duration of antiviral therapy was seven days (interquartile range (IQR): five to eight days), and one-third of study participants developed side effects due to antiviral administration. The proportions of renal and hepatic side effects were found to be comparable (25.5% and 21.3%, respectively). Furthermore, the frequency of overall symptom improvement on completion of antiviral therapy was found to be 70.2%. An improvement in oxygen saturation was found to be significant with combined antiviral therapy. A total of 10 death events were reported during the study period, yielding 22 poor outcomes per 1000 person-days. COVID-19 patients taking combined therapy had significantly longer survival times compared to those taking a single agent (15 and 23 days, P > 0.05, respectively). The cumulative probability of survival at the end of the study period among those receiving single and combined therapy was found to be 29% and 38%, respectively. The findings from the present study showed that combined remdesivir and favipiravir have a superior effect than single favipiravir medication in treating high-risk hospitalized COVID-19 patients. These results highlight the clinical importance of combined antiviral regimens in enhancing patient prognoses, reducing mortality rates and shortening hospital stays.",,,

This qualitative study utilized a novel questionnaire that included both multiple-choice and free-text questions. The latter were grounded in critical incident technique (CIT), a methodology that uses direct observations of human behavior to solve practical problems. The questionnaire was distributed electronically to the study's population of health sciences administrators, faculty, and staff in Texas who were involved with IPE. Multiple-choice data were analyzed via descriptive statistics, while free-text data were coded and analyzed via inductive thematic analysis principles. There were 48 responses out of 131 individuals contacted directly for a response rate of 36.64%. Educators recognized a wide range of characteristics needed by IPE facilitators but viewed interpersonal skills as most important. While many reported experience with non-clinician facilitators of IPE activities, fewer had experience working with health sciences librarians in these roles. Educator attitudes toward non-clinician facilitators of IPE, including librarians, were largely positive. The findings of this study indicated that educators view interpersonal skills and the ability to elicit engagement as more important skills for IPE facilitators than a relevant clinical background. With proper facilitator training, non-clinicians could build upon their existing skillsets and increase their involvement with IPE, creating a larger pool of potential facilitators. A greater availability of skilled facilitators could increase the incidence of IPE, potentially resulting in more collaborative care and improved patient outcomes.",,,rachel.helbing@cuanschutz.edu

A before-and-after, retrospective cohort study comparing patients presenting to Christchurch ED with acute uncomplicated AF in the year before ('hospital-based' follow-up) and after ('community-based' follow-up) implementation of a new AF management approach. The 'community' pathway replaced hospital-based review with a next-day community follow-up and introduced more specific anticoagulation recommendations. A total of 1065 patients met inclusion criteria, with 531 presenting during the 'hospital-based' pathway period and 534 during the 'community' pathway period. The spontaneous reversion rate was approximately 61% in both cohorts. Following the implementation of the community pathway, there was no increase in cardioversions (16.6% vs 20%, difference 3.5% [95% CI -1.4 to 8.3]), admission rates (32.8% vs 32.2%, difference - 0.6% [95% CI -6.4 to 5.3]), or AEs (60-day all-cause mortality 1.3% vs 0.9%, difference - 0.7% [95% CI -2.3 to 1]). Attendance at a follow-up AF clinic improved from 92.9% to 98.1% (difference 5.2% [95% CI 0.7-9.7]). Clinician adherence to anticoagulation guidelines increased by 7% (95% CI 1.6-12.4). A 'rate-and-wait' strategy for managing acute uncomplicated AF continues to allow a significant proportion of patients to self-revert to sinus rhythm, without requiring hospital admission or cardioversion procedures. Transitioning to an off-site, community AF clinic is both safe and effective, demonstrating increased clinic attendance and improved adherence to anticoagulation guidelines.",Pickering JW; Addy K,Emergency Department; General Medicine,

We evaluated clinical and bacteriological outcomes with a seven-drug, linezolid-containing SCR in a high-burden programmatic setting. This prospective cohort study enrolled adults with newly diagnosed RR-TB who were started on the oral SCR in the Eastern Cape Province, South Africa. The primary outcome was World Health Organization-defined end-of-treatment success. Secondary outcomes were TB-free survival (composite of alive, absence of a positive Mycobacterium tuberculosis culture, and treatment completed or in care) at 18 months and time to sputum culture conversion (SCC). In total, 248 participants were included, 173 (69.8%) of whom were human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) positive. Culture conversion by 90 days was 96.8% (median time to SCC: 29 days, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 27-31). Treatment success was 37.5% (93/248). Reasons for unsuccessful treatment included switching to individualised regimens (35.1%, 87/248), loss to follow-up (19.4%, 48/348), and death (8.1%, 20/248).

Non-Hispanic African Americans had a high incidence rate of lung cancer at 55.8 per 100 000 people, as well as the highest death rate at 37.2 per 100 000 people from 2016 to 2020. While previous genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified over 45 susceptibility risk loci that influence lung cancer development, few GWAS have investigated the etiology of lung cancer in African Americans. To address this gap in knowledge, we conducted GWAS of lung cancer focused on studying African Americans, comprising 2267 lung cancer cases and 4264 controls. We identified three loci associated with lung cancer, one with lung adenocarcinoma, and four with lung squamous cell carcinoma in this population at the genomic-wide significance level. Among them, three novel loci were identified near VWF at 12p13.31 for overall lung cancer and GACAT3 at 2p24.3 and LMAN1L at 15q24.1 for lung squamous cell carcinoma.

We sought to identify shared and disorder-specific neurocognitive endophenotypes for schizophrenia, bipolar I disorder (BD-I) and a broad psychosis/BD-I phenotype in a mega-analysis of twin/sibling data. We performed genetic model fitting to intelligence (IQ) and computerised neurocognitive data derived from 1050 twins/siblings from three research centres in the UK, Denmark and the Netherlands, affected (n = 257) or unaffected (n = 793) by schizophrenia, other primary psychoses and BD-I. We examined the endophenotypic status of IQ, spatial working memory (SWM), visual recognition, sustained attention/rapid visual processing (RVP), mental flexibility, and spatial planning/problem solving (all validated as endophenotypes for schizophrenia in previous studies) in relation to schizophrenia, BD-I and the broad phenotype. After covarying for age, gender, education and research centre, IQ and SWM emerged as transdiagnostic endophenotypes, showing statistically significant heritabilities (h2 67-75% and 28-30%, respectively), phenotypic correlations (rph |0.14|-|0.25|) and genetic correlations (rg |0.18|-|0.42|) with all diagnostic phenotypes. Additionally, all remaining cognitive domains received validation as endophenotypes for the broad phenotype, and all, but RVP, for schizophrenia.

The Every Newborn Action Plan (ENAP) prioritised four life-saving interventions for small and/or sick newborns (SSN) in health facilities: neonatal resuscitation, kangaroo mother care, antibiotic treatment of possible serious bacterial infections, and antenatal corticosteroids for women at risk of preterm birth at <34 weeks of gestation. Limited indicator reporting on the use of these interventions in routine health information systems (RHIS) is a barrier to scaling up SSN care. The World Health Organization (WHO) led a multi-step process to agree coverage indicators for the four SSN interventions, which included a rapid review of existing research and programme reports; expert consultation to review available evidence, deliberate and propose coverage indicators, assess feasibility in RHIS, and identify research gaps. Expert working groups discussed and recommended definitions for each of the four coverage indicators. After considering feasibility and challenges, potential sources of data for each indicator were appraised. Data for these indicators is not always routinely collected in registers, requiring information from clinical case records, which can be challenging in resource-constrained health systems. The proposed indicators were also assessed against established indicator assessment criteria. The need for testing the indicators was emphasised and other research gaps were also identified. Reporting and monitoring the life-saving SSN interventions in routine health information systems (RHIS) is crucial for improving newborn care in LMICs. Urgent consideration must be given to how this data can be collected from health facilities and subsequently reported in RHIS. Improved RHIS measures for these interventions will enable programme managers and policy makers to scale up their use, accelerating reductions in preventable neonatal morbidity and mortality.",,,

The programs targeting existing HNHC patients have shown limited long-term impact, and research predicting HNHC pediatric patients in China is limited. There is an urgent need to establish a specific, valid, and reliable prediction model using machine-learning-based methods to identify potential HNHC pediatric patients and implement proactive interventions before high costs arise. This study used a 7-year retrospective cohort dataset from two administrative databases in Shanghai, covering pediatric patients under 18 years. The machine-learning-based models were developed to predict HNHC status using logistic regression, k-nearest neighbors (KNN), random forest (RF), multi-layer perceptron (MLP), and Naive Bayes. This study divided the data from 2021-2022 into 70:30 as a training set and a test set, with the internal class balancing approach of the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE). A grid search strategy was employed with k-fold cross-validation to optimize hyperparameters. Model performance was assessed by 5 metrics: Receiver Operating Characteristic-Area Under Curve (ROC-AUC), accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and F1 score. The external validation from 2022-2023 data and the internal validation using different train-test ratios (80:20 and 90:10) were used to assess the robustness of the trained models. Among the 91,882 hospitalized children included in 2021, significant differences were found in socioeconomics, disease, healthcare service utilization, previous healthcare expenditure, and hospital characteristics between the HNHC and non-HNHC groups. The hospitalization costs for HNHC pediatric patients accounted for over 35% of total spending. The MLP model demonstrated the highest predictive performance (ROC-AUC: 0.872), followed by RF (0.869), KNN (0.836), and naive Bayes (0.828). The most important predictive factors included length of stay, number of hospitalizations, previous HNHC status, age, and presence of Top 20 HNHC diseases.

Calculate the proportion of congenital heart disease and cardiac abnormalities related to heart valves in patients with IS, and screen the risk factors by multivariate analysis. Twelve patients (4.15%) had congenital heart disease, with atrial septal defect being the most common type (1.73%). Eighty-eight patients (30.45%) had cardiac abnormalities related to heart valves, with mild tricuspid regurgitation being the most common type (17.65%). There were no statistically significant differences in the proportion of congenital heart disease among groups based on gender(P = 0.096), age(6 ~ 10 vs. 11-18, P = 0.200), ethnicity(Han vs. Minority, P = 0.969), BMI grade(Emaciation vs. Normal vs. Overweight/Obesity, P = 0.512), altitude(< 2000 m vs. ≥ 2000 m, P = 0.078), main curvature location(Thoracic vs. Thoracolumbar vs. Lumbar, P = 0.326), severity of scoliosis(Deformed vs. Highly deformed, P = 0.841), main direction(P = 0.102), and chest aspect ratio(< 0.45 vs. ≥ 0.45, P = 0.341). The proportion of cardiac abnormalities related to heart valves was higher in males, patients with thoracolumbar IS, and patients with left-sided scoliosis (P < 0.05). Multivariate analysis showed that males and thoracolumbar scoliosis were risk factors for cardiac abnormalities related to heart valves in patients with IS (P < 0.05). Linear regression analysis showed that altitude had a weak correlation with IS combined with congenital heart disease (R²=0.018, P < 0.05). Among 289 patients with idiopathic scoliosis who required surgery, 4.15% had congenital heart disease, and 30.45% had cardiac abnormalities related to heart valves. Males and scoliosis in thoracolumbar were risk factors for cardiac abnormalities related to heart valves in patients with idiopathic scoliosis.",,,ynwys@163.com.

Social isolation and loneliness are common issues affecting care home residents' quality of life. Due to visitation restrictions during the pandemic, residents and family members started using digital solutions to keep in contact. There is no framework or guidelines to inform the uptake and use of technologies in the care home context, and this often results in non-adoption and a lack of use after the introduction phase. Hence, there is a great need for research on the feasibility of a robot that can facilitate video communication between residents and family members. This study aimed to (1) introduce video communication through a robot to address social isolation and loneliness in a care home during a period of 6 weeks and (2) identify elements central to the feasibility concerning testing and evaluating the use of the robot. Three focus group interviews were undertaken: 1 with family members (n=4) and 2 with care staff (n=2 each). The informants were purposely selected to ensure that they had the proper amount of experience with the robot to have the ability to inform this study's objectives. The focus group interviews were tape-recorded and transcribed verbatim, then subsequently analyzed using systematic text condensation. The data analysis of focus group interviews and individual interviews resulted in three categories: (1) organizing the facilitation of video calls, (2) using a robot in dementia care, and (3) user experience with the robot. Video communication in care homes is a feasible alternative to face-to-face interactions, but it depends on organizational factors such as information flow, resources, and scheduling. In dementia care, the user-friendly robot supports person-centered care through tailored social interaction. Both family members and staff express enthusiasm for video calls as an option and see its potential for future use.",,,

This study examines family medicine providers' personal experiences with SIL, their perspectives on its importance in clinical practice, and their readiness to incorporate it into medical education. A cross-sectional survey was conducted by the Council of Academic Family Medicine Educational Research Alliance (CERA) among members of major U.S. academic family medicine organizations between October and November 2024. Responses on the 3-item UCLA Loneliness Scale and items assessing attitudes toward SIL in clinical practice and medical education were analyzed using descriptive and bivariate statistics. Among 1,004 respondents (response rate 20.7%), 27.8% had sum scores ≥ 6 on the UCLA-3 item scale indicating considerable loneliness. SIL was particularly prevalent among women (31.1%), underrepresented minorities (36.1%), and Black/African American respondents (40.3%). While 54.1% rated SIL as important in family medicine and 68.2% supported regular screening, only 32.5% agreed that managing SIL falls within clinicians' responsibility. Providers experiencing SIL themselves reported less frequent patient discussions about loneliness (23.7% vs. 32.0%, p = 0.023) and fewer community partnerships. Most respondents (71.0%) reported inadequate resources in their clinics to address SIL. Family medicine educators experience substantial rates of loneliness, particularly among minority groups, at levels exceeding those of their patients and the general population. Personal experiences with SIL appear to influence clinical practices and teaching. Before implementing widespread screening initiatives, the profession must address both providers' own social connectedness needs and the development of practical clinical resources.",,,frank.mueller@med.uni-goettingen.de.

This study synthesizes evidence on disruptions to primary care, focusing on hypertension and diabetes care and mitigation approaches taken during the pandemic in Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC). We conducted a scoping review, searching nine electronic databases for studies from January 2020 to December 2022 on COVID-19-related primary care disruptions and interventions, including studies on hospital-based interventions given their relevance to the pandemic response in LAC. We adapted the Primary Health Care Performance Initiative framework to develop our search strategy and synthesize data. For studies reporting interventions, we included studies conducted outside of LAC. Of 33,510 references screened, 388 studies were included (259 reported disruptions in LAC, 61 interventions in LAC, 63 interventions outside LAC, and five interventions from countries within and outside LAC), with three-quarters presenting data from Brazil, Argentina, Mexico, and Peru; few studies focused on rural areas. Additionally, the few studies that adequately quantified care disruptions reported a reduction in hypertension and diabetes control during the pandemic (e.g., hypertension control rate decreased from 68 to 55% in Mexico). Frequently reported causes of disruption included burnout and mental health challenges among healthcare workers (with disproportionate effects by type of worker), reduced medication supplies, and reduced frequency of clinic visits by patients (e.g., due to financial constraints). The most reported interventions included remote care strategies (e.g., smartphone applications, virtual meeting platforms) and mental health programs for healthcare workers. Remote care strategies were deemed feasible for care delivery, triaging, and clinical support for non-physicians. Patients were generally satisfied with telemedicine, whereas providers had mixed perceptions. Robust evidence on the effectiveness of remote care strategies for diabetes and hypertension care was unavailable in LAC. Hypertension and diabetes control appeared to worsen in LAC during the pandemic. Major reported causes of care disruptions were workforce issues, reduced medication supply, and changes in patient perceptions of seeking and receiving primary healthcare. Remote care strategies were feasible for various purposes and were well received by patients. However, the lack of data on intervention effectiveness underscores the importance of strengthening research capacity to generate robust evidence during future pandemics. Developing resilient healthcare systems able to provide care for hypertension and diabetes during future pandemics will depend on investment in the healthcare workforce, medical supply chain, health data and research infrastructure, and technology readiness.",Mehta R; Yeboah-Kordieh Y,Department of Internal Medicine; Departamento de Endocrinología y Metabolismo,kuni.matsushita@jhu.edu.

Reclassified as a malignant fibrous histiocytoma by the World Health Organization in 2002, UPS predominantly affects men aged 50-70 years. Diagnosis is difficult due to nonspecific symptoms, such as acute urinary retention (AUR) and haematuria, along with normal prostate-specific antigen levels, which often lead to confusion with benign prostatic hyperplasia. This case report discusses the clinical presentation, diagnostic process and management of an 82-year-old man who presented with AUR. Imaging studies, such as transrectal ultrasound, computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging, were used to evaluate the tumour. Histological examination and immunostaining were performed after transurethral resection to confirm the diagnosis of UPS. The images revealed a large, irregular, invasive tumour within the prostate, leading to a radical cystoprostatectomy. Histological analysis showed atypical spindle cells and positive immunostaining for histiocytic markers, such as vimentin and CD68 (a marker of monocyte/macrophage lineage), confirming the diagnosis of UPS. Surgical margins were negative, and no residual disease was detected in the postoperative period. The rarity of prostatic UPS underscores the ongoing debate about its optimal management. This case contributes to the limited literature on prostatic UPS, highlighting the importance of early detection and complete surgical removal to improve prognosis. More research is needed to establish a consensus on adjuvant therapies.",,,

The education sector was also significantly impacted, with numerous educational institutions adopting online learning due to the pandemic. The university period is one of substantial transformation and transition for young individuals. During this educational stage, the advent of emerging social networks, coupled with the necessity for effective network management, can precipitate stress in university students, potentially leading to alterations in their psychological well-being. The objective of this study was to compare the self-efficacy, psychological resilience and self-confidence of university students with different levels of physical activity (PA) according to gender and school year variables. The study was a cross-sectional design. The Sample comprised 2,868 undergraduate students, 1,405 female and 1,463 male, enrolled in 10 different faculties at Çanakkale Onsekiz Mart University. The participants were administered the International Physical Activity Questionnaire, the General Self-Confidence Scale, the Psychological Resilience Scale and the Self-Efficacy Scale. Significant difference was observed between the general self-efficacy score of participants with low and moderate PA levels and those with high levels of PA. The psychological resilience variable was affected by the level of PA. Individuals with a low level of PA exhibited a lower level of psychological resilience than those with a moderate or high level of PA. Upon analysis of self-confidence, both internal and external self-confidence scores demonstrated an upward trajectory for the low, moderate, and high PA groups. Furthermore, the results of the study indicated that as the level of PA increased, there was a corresponding increase in self-efficacy, psychological resilience and self-confidence among university students. Results indicated that higher levels of PA among university students were positively associated with increased self-confidence, self-efficacy, and psychological resilience. Consequently, by facilitating the organization of diverse physical activities and providing opportunities, university administrations can foster enhanced self-confidence, self-efficacy and psychological resilience among their students.",,,ozgider@comu.edu.tr.

Despite its nutritional benefits, misconceptions persist regarding its potential to promote weight gain, particularly when consumed at dinner. While no evidence supports this concern, emerging chrononutritional research suggests that evening carbohydrate intake may positively influence sleep quality by promoting serotonin production. This study aims to assess, for the first time, whether pasta consumption (lunch vs. dinner) affects sleep quality, circadian rhythms, cardiometabolic health, and gut microbiota composition in healthy, normal-weight adults. A 7-month randomized, open-label, cross-over trial will enroll 70 participants, assigned to two isocaloric, Mediterranean-style diets differing only in pasta consumption timing. Each phase will last 3 months, separated by a 1-month wash-out period. At the beginning and end of each phase, participants will wear an actigraph for 7 days and provide saliva, blood, and stool samples. Additional assessments include body composition analysis, indirect calorimetry, and food and lifestyle diaries. The primary outcome will be changes in sleep quality from baseline. Secondary outcomes include anthropometric measurements, body composition, metabolic rate, biochemical and hormonal markers, inflammatory and oxidative stress markers, gut microbiota composition, and short-chain fatty acid production. The study has been approved by the Tuscany Regional Ethics Committee of the Azienda Ospedaliera Universitaria (AOU)-Careggi, Florence.

There is emerging evidence that concurrent mechanical left ventricular (LV) unloading (e.g. an intra-aortic balloon pump, or microaxial left ventricular assist device) may improve survival. Despite this, there are no large, well-conducted studies investigating the impact of LV unloading on outcomes in ECPR. We queried the Extracorporeal Life Support Organisation (ELSO) registry between 2020 and 2023, and used an emulated target trial framework to investigate the association between concurrent mechanical left ventricular unloading and outcomes in patients receiving ECPR. We imputed missing data using multiple imputation with chained equations, and identified potential confounders implicated in the causal pathway between ECPR and survival time up to 90 days (primary outcome). We used propensity score-matching to adjust for potential confounders, and analysed the primary outcome using a Cox proportional hazards model. We then emulated further target trials based on the inclusion criteria of prior ECPR RCTs to assess whether concurrent unloading was associated with better outcomes based on these criteria. Secondary outcomes included complications from ECPR as classified by ELSO, and survival with favourable functional outcome defined as a Cerebral Performance Category (CPC) 1-2. Of the 3,215 patients included in our analysis, we matched 621 pairs of patients who did and did not receive LV unloading. There were no significant differences in survival time between both groups (HR 0.92, 95%-CI 0.79-1.08), nor survival with favourable functional outcomes (OR 1.15, 95%-CI 0.67-1.99). This was concordant across several sensitivity analyses. Of note, LV unloading was associated with a higher rate of renal (OR 1.55, 95%-CI 1.16-2.07) and cardiovascular (OR 1.60, 95%-CI 1.14-2.26) complications. LV unloading was also associated with central nervous system bleeding (OR 1.75, 95%-CI 1.03-2.96), arrhythmias (OR 1.56, 95%-CI 1.04-2.36), and haemolysis (OR 1.85, 95%-CI 1.10-3.09). Left ventricular unloading was not associated with improved survival in the context of ECPR and may increase complication rates.

Understanding the levels of fatigue and the coping strategies employed by nurses can help develop effective interventions. This study aimed to assess the fatigue levels of Chinese night-shift nurses and explore commonly used anti-fatigue strategies. A cross-sectional study was conducted in Zhejiang Province, China, using the Occupational Fatigue Exhaustion/Recovery Scale (OFER) questionnaire. The survey assessed acute and chronic fatigue levels, fatigue recovery, and anti-fatigue strategies among nurses. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS 26.0. Among the 371 valid responses, chronic fatigue levels (66.41 ± 24.17) were higher than acute fatigue levels (57.31 ± 15.61). Nurses with higher education levels reported lower acute fatigue, while older, more experienced nurses and those working in higher-grade hospitals had lower chronic fatigue. Common coping strategies included naps (63.88%) and stimulant consumption (54.72%), with coffee (45.37%) and milk tea (23.28%) being the most popular drinks. Our findings indicate that Chinese night-shift nurses experience substantial fatigue, especially chronic fatigue, which is influenced by factors including education, age, clinical experience, exercise frequency, and hospital grade. Although personal coping strategies are common, they fall short in mitigating fatigue, underscoring the need for comprehensive interventions that combine individual and organizational measures. not applicable.",,,ry0900@zju.edu.cn.

The current study aimed to (1) develop a machine learning-based prediction model for future STBs using data from a large prospective cohort of Spanish HCWs and (2) identify the most important variables in terms of contribution to the model's predictive accuracy. This is a prospective, multicentre cohort study of Spanish HCWs active during the COVID-19 pandemic. A total of 8,996 HCWs participated in the web-based baseline survey (May-July 2020) and 4,809 in the 4-month follow-up survey. A total of 219 predictor variables were derived from the baseline survey. The outcome variable was any STB at the 4-month follow-up. Variable selection was done using an L1 regularized linear Support Vector Classifier (SVC). A random forest model with 5-fold cross-validation was developed, in which the Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) and undersampling of the majority class balancing techniques were tested. The model was evaluated by the area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (AUROC) curve and the area under the precision-recall curve. Shapley's additive explanatory values (SHAP values) were used to evaluate the overall contribution of each variable to the prediction of future STBs. Results were obtained separately by gender. The prevalence of STBs in HCWs at the 4-month follow-up was 7.9% (women = 7.8%, men = 8.2%). Thirty-four variables were selected by the L1 regularized linear SVC. The best results were obtained without data balancing techniques: AUROC = 0.87 (0.86 for women and 0.87 for men) and area under the precision-recall curve = 0.50 (0.55 for women and 0.45 for men). Based on SHAP values, the most important baseline predictors for any STB at the 4-month follow-up were the presence of passive suicidal ideation, the number of days in the past 30 days with passive or active suicidal ideation, the number of days in the past 30 days with binge eating episodes, the number of panic attacks (women only) and the frequency of intrusive thoughts (men only). Machine learning-based prediction models for STBs in HCWs during the COVID-19 pandemic trained on web-based survey data present high discrimination and classification capacity. Future clinical implementations of this model could enable the early detection of HCWs at the highest risk for developing adverse mental health outcomes.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, fear and anxiety negatively impacted nurse well-being. Understanding the factors contributing to well-being amongst cancer nurses is a priority, as chronic stress can negatively influence job satisfaction and standards of care. A multi methods approach comprising a repeated measures survey (n = 69), semi-structured interviews (n = 29) and two focus groups was used. This enabled in-depth exploration of nurses' experiences over time. Following ethical approval, nurses from different cancer settings were recruited from NW England. The survey measured anxiety, depression, self-efficacy, resilience and well-being at three time-points [baseline; 3 months and 6 months]. Data was collected Feb-Oct 2022. Participants were also invited to participate in an interview and focus group. This data was subject to Thematic Analysis. Data sources were triangulated to substantiate findings. Ethical approval was obtained and participants provided informed consent. Survey data revealed anxiety, well-being, self-efficacy and resilience were broadly consistent over time. The only significant difference was depression, where mean scores at times 2 and 3 were significantly lower than time 1. While most participants reported mild to moderate anxiety and depression throughout the study, at time 3 a significant minority (32%, 9/28) reported severe depression. Four themes arose from interviews: (i) the principles and practice of nursing, (ii) the impact of COVID-19 on nurses' identity, (iii) self-management strategies, (iv) organisational responses. Focus group data emphasised the need for improved communication concerning well-being services. Nurses used coping strategies throughout the pandemic and beyond, drawing on professional and personal experiences and adapting to clinical service changes. Well-being was sustained through peer and patient interactions, and work routines. Workplace cultures supporting and normalising nurses' well-being should be encouraged and co-creation of interventions to build resilience and improve communication. Importantly interventions should be evaluated for their effectiveness and barriers to accessing support removed. Our findings build on theory addressing workplace culture, high stress environments and individuals' self-awareness of well-being needs. Research is needed to understand the well-being needs of cancer nurses according to banding, work setting, and pre-existing psychological morbidity.

A qualitative design with focus groups was applied, based on a social constructivist research tradition. This approach differs from other qualitative methods, such as interviews, in that it encourages interaction between research participants and contributes to shedding light on a collective understanding of the world. This means that the analysis is based on the group's collective input, not individual statements. The study group consisted of 21 professionals participating in four focus groups, with five to six participants per group. The participants in each group represented different professions within the geriatric team, including nurses, nursing assistants, physicians, occupational therapists, and physiotherapists. The results underscore the importance of the CFS as the basis for CGA, emphasizing the effectiveness of the scale as a shared instrument promoting collaboration in healthcare. Our study uniquely points out the lack of research exploring the team-based use of tools for conducting a frailty assessment using the CFS. The study also highlights the importance of effective teamwork and a person-centred approach. The balance between person-centred care and what is feasible within the organization is crucial to providing the best possible care for patients. In Sweden, as in other places, how healthcare staff experience their work is key to the quality of care. The study concludes that positive staff experiences with new approaches drive healthcare improvement, benefiting patients and society.

A total of five adolescents, nine parents, and eleven HCPs were interviewed. Three major themes were determined: (1) facilitators to participation and implementation, (2) barriers to participation and implementation, and (3) suggestions for improvement. Factors identified as keys to participation include tailoring interventions to families' specific needs and social support. Organizational barriers, health issues, and a lack of interest or need hampered participation in the program. Implementation was positively impacted by the interventions' perceived relevance and negatively by their lack of integration in clinical care. While HP interventions hold promise for improving quality of life, successful implementation requires addressing the multifaceted challenges faced by participants and providers.",Kerba J; Bourque CJ; Lamore K; Bouchard I; Meloche C; Laverdière C; Curnier D; Marcil V; Sultan S; Sinnett D; Higgins J,Laboratoire de Psychopathologie et Processus de Santé; CHU Ste-Justine; Montreal Centre for Interdisciplinary Research in Rehabilitation (CRIR),

Care integration and task shifting are two frameworks that may strengthen person-centered care among individuals with MDD and comorbid diagnoses, including for adults with limited access to healthcare resources living in rural settings within sub-Saharan Africa. We assessed the acceptability and feasibility of group psychotherapy (Problem Management Plus [PM+]) integrated into chronic healthcare services in Neno District, based on key informant (KI) interviews with clients who received PM+ services from local counselors. We conducted in-depth interviews with 31 KIs, comprising adult patients participating in group PM+ in rural Malawi. The interview covered facets such as knowledge acquisition, logistical considerations for organizing PM+ sessions, selection of appropriate venues, session format, and overall perceived acceptability. Themes were identified through thematic content analysis. We identified five emergent themes: limited prior awareness and understanding of MDD, positive elements of the PM+ service delivery model, patients' perceived effectiveness of PM+, logistical challenges with effectively engaging PM+, and positive views on acceptability of PM+. Findings revealed a strong appreciation and enthusiasm for PM+, although KIs noted areas for improvement - including lengthy travel times to receive PM+, limited compensation and privacy, and counselors arriving late. Insights from clients underscore the potential utility of group PM+ as a task-shifted model of MDD care that can be integrated into existing service packages in resource-limited settings, as well as opportunities for improvements such as reducing travel time to care and identifying venues with greater client privacy.

Levels of total IgE change with age and tend to be higher in individuals with allergic diseases than in those without. To improve the clinical utility of total IgE, this study aimed to establish continuous paediatric reference intervals (RIs) for healthy individuals. The study participants consisted of healthy term neonates and children aged 30 days to 18 years. Venous blood samples were collected, and total serum IgE concentrations were measured by performing a fluoroenzyme immunoassay. Fractional polynomial regression modelling and quantile regression were applied in the statistical analysis to generate continuous RIs. A total of 441 samples were analysed for total serum IgE, including 12 neonate samples and 429 paediatric samples from birth to 18 years of age, with males representing 51.5% (n=227) of the samples.

Life expectancy of those who smoke is on average 10 years shorter than those who do not smoke. It is the most important modifiable risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD), doubling the risk of abdominal aortic aneurysm, coronary artery disease, ischemic stroke, and peripheral arterial disease. Smoking cessation is the single most powerful preventative intervention in clinical practice. Within 1 year of smoking cessation, the risk of CVD events decreases by 50%; after 15 years, the risk is the same as that of someone who has never smoked. Those who quit by age 40 have a life expectancy similar to that of people who have never smoked. Smoking cessation is a fundamental responsibility of every health care provider and must be a priority in all clinical settings. All patients must be systematically identified, treated, and have sufficient follow-up arranged. Advice should be brief, clear, and unambiguous to inform people who smoke about the harms of smoking and the benefits of cessation, in a personalized and nonjudgemental manner. It should be combined with pharmacotherapy because this can increase the likelihood of success by almost threefold. Health care practitioners should be as comfortable managing smoking cessation and initiating pharmacotherapy as they would be managing other CVD risk factors like hypertension or dyslipidemia.",Cowley E; San Cartier R,Department of Pharmacy; Maamwesying North Shore Community Health Services,HMir@ottawaheart.ca.
40339939,Automatic Impactors in Total Hip Arthroplasty: A State-of-the-Art Review.,,The Journal of arthroplasty,10.1016/j.arth.2025.04.077,"Total hip arthroplasty (THA) is an increasingly common procedure that places considerable physical strain on orthopaedic surgeons over time. The procedure requires precise impaction for optimal implant fixation and long-term stability. Automated impactors have emerged as innovative tools to address the limitations of manual mallets, with efforts to improve surgeons' physical health, surgical efficiency, and patient outcomes. This review evaluates the specifications, clinical applications, ergonomic benefits, and occupational hazards such as noise of commercially available automated impactors, including KINCISE, Woodpecker, HAMMR, and orthodrive. This is compared to existing literature on the devices and supplemented with independent noise measurements. It aimed to provide actionable insights to guide device selection based on clinical scenarios and operating room needs. A systematic PubMed search (2013 to 2024) identified 147 relevant articles after excluding studies on impaction grafting and trauma. Product specifications and noise data were supplemented with patent information and manufacturer details. Noise mitigation strategies and ergonomic considerations were also explored. Sound levels of three of the discussed impactors were measured to supplement this review. Automated impactors demonstrated significant reductions in femoral broaching time, improved consistency, and reduced surgeon fatigue compared to manual methods. Periprosthetic fracture risk was equal to or less than that of manual broaching. Each impactor exhibited unique strengths: KINCISE offered versatility, Woodpecker precision, HAMMR adjustability, and orthodrive the lowest noise production of the devices measured. However, trade-offs compared to the traditional mallet included cost, learning curves, and limited versatility in some devices. Time-weighted average (TWA) noise levels ranged from 57.37 to 67.47 dBA across devices, with maximum levels ranging from 101.2 to 107.3 dBA, remaining below the Occupational Safety and Health Administration TWA 85 dBA threshold and the World Health Organization (WHO) maximum threshold of 110 dBA. Automated impactors enhance procedural efficiency and ergonomics in THA, but device selection should be tailored to specific surgical and institutional needs. Noise levels were similar across devices, though close to the WHO maximum threshold. Future research should focus on long-term patient outcomes and standardizing testing protocols for these devices.",,,David.deckey@gmail.com.

Our recent clinical study reported that a high concentration of plasma fibulin-5 (FBLN5), one of matricellular proteins, was associated with poor outcomes after SAH. The aim of this study was to investigate whether and how FBLN5 was associated with EBI during an acute phase of SAH in mice. C57BL/6 male mice underwent sham or filament perforation SAH modeling, and vehicle or four dosages (0.001, 0.01, 0.1, and 1 μg) of short or long recombinant FBLN5 (rFBLN5) were randomly administrated by an intracerebroventricular injection. Neurobehavioral test, measurements of brain water content, immunohistochemical staining, and Western blotting were performed to evaluate EBI 24 h after SAH. Short rFBLN5 had no significant effects on EBI, but administration of long rFBLN5 containing an arginine-glycine-aspartic acid motif improved neurobehavior functions depending on the dosages, without affecting brain edema. Administration of long rFBLN5 also reduced cleaved caspase-3-dependent neuronal apoptosis, associated with the inhibition of post-SAH upregulation of transforming growth factor-β1, but no significant changes in the expression level of Smad 2/3, mitogen-activated protein kinases, and another matricellular protein tenascin-C. Although further research is required to clarify the detailed mechanism, this study demonstrated for the first time that FBLN5 played a protective role against neuronal apoptosis in an acute phase of experimental SAH.",,,box_308044@yahoo.co.jp.

A total of 155 teeth with unintentional root canal sealer extrusion in at least one root were identified from 7196 endodontically treated teeth between January 2015 and December 2023. Clinical and radiographic data were collected to assess treatment outcomes and sealer dissolution. Outcomes (per root) were classified as success or failure based on strict and loose criteria. Sealer dissolution was categorized as no, partial, or complete. Bivariate and multivariate multilevel logistic regression analyses were conducted to identify variables associated with treatment outcomes and sealer dissolution (p < 0.05). With an average follow-up period of 13 months, the success rates were 54.87 % based on strict criteria and 98.46 % based on loose criteria. Complete dissolution of the sealer was observed in 4.17 % of cases using epoxy resin-based sealers and 11.11 % of cases using calcium silicate-based sealers. Multilevel analysis revealed that the size of the periapical lesion significantly influenced treatment success when evaluated using strict criteria. Treatment outcomes and sealer dissolution in cases with unintentional sealer extrusion were not influenced by the type of extruded material. The size of the periapical lesion was the only significant predictor of treatment success based on strict criteria. This study confirms the high success rate of endodontically treated teeth, even with unintentional sealer extrusion. However, a large periapical radiolucency significantly reduces success rates.",,,chanakarn.si@chula.ac.th.

We systematically searched six electronic databases, three preprint archives, and conference proceedings (January 2010-April 2024). Studies reporting quantitative performance metrics for supervised ML-based STI risk prediction models were included. We used a bivariate random-effects model to estimate pooled sensitivity, specificity, and area under the curve (AUC). The risk of bias was assessed using the PROBAST tool. We conducted sequential analyses of studies with complete and reconstructed confusion matrices. Subgroup analyses and meta-regression explored potential sources of heterogeneity. Among 3,877 records screened, 25 studies comprising 45 unique models met inclusion criteria. For HIV, analysis of studies with complete confusion matrices (7 studies, 9 contingency tables) demonstrated summary AUC of 0.91 (95%CI:0.88-0.93), pooled sensitivity 0.84 (0.76-0.90), and specificity 0.84 (0.70-0.93). Substantial heterogeneity persisted across subgroups (I²>98%).

Oncology,10.1016/S1470-2045(25)00197-4,"Various locoregional treatments exist for PET-CT-detected pelvic nodal oligorecurrences in patients with prostate cancer. We aimed to assess whether elective nodal radiotherapy (ENRT) to the pelvis would be superior to metastasis-directed therapy (MDT). PEACE V-STORM is a phase 2, open-label, randomised, controlled trial conducted in 21 hospitals in Australia, Belgium, Italy, Norway, Spain, and Switzerland. Eligible participants were aged 18 years or older, with WHO performance status 0-1 and a histologically confirmed initial diagnosis of adenocarcinoma of the prostate, with a PET-detected pelvic nodal oligorecurrence (up to five nodes) following radical local treatment. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to MDT or ENRT. Randomisation was done online by minimisation with randomisation factor 0·80 and was stratified by type of PET tracer (choline vs prostate-specific membrane antigen) and type of MDT used (salvage lymph node dissection vs stereotactic body radiotherapy or simultaneous integrated boost). Participants and researchers were not masked to treatment assignment. Patients in the MDT group had salvage lymph node dissection or stereotactic body radiotherapy (30 Gy in three fractions every other day), with 6 months of androgen deprivation therapy. Patients in the ENRT group received a 45 Gy dose in 25 fractions to the pelvis with a simultaneous integrated boost of 65 Gy to the PET-positive nodes or salvage lymph node dissection, with 6 months of androgen deprivation therapy. The primary endpoint was metastasis-free survival, defined as the time between randomisation and the appearance of a metastatic recurrence (any M1) on PET imaging or death due to any cause, and was analysed per modified intention to treat. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03569241, and the Swiss National Clinical Trials Portal, SNCTP000002947, and is active, not recruiting. Between June 11, 2018, and April 30, 2021, 198 patients were screened for eligibility, 196 of whom were randomly assigned to MDT (n=99) or ENRT (n=97), with 190 evaluable patients (MDT n=97 and ENRT n=93). All patients were male. Data on race and ethnicity were not collected. Median follow-up was 50 months (IQR 42-58). 4-year metastasis-free survival was 63% (80% CI 56-69) in the MDT group and 76% (69-81) in the ENRT group (HR 0·62 [80% CI 0·44-0·86]; p=0·063). The most common grade 3 adverse events were urinary incontinence (six [6%] of 97 in the MDT group vs nine [10%] in the ENRT group) and diarrhoea (one [1%] in the MDT group vs two [2%] in the ENRT group). No treatment-related deaths occurred. To our knowledge, this is the first randomised trial for metachronous PET-detected nodal recurrences comparing two local treatment approaches (MDT and ENRT) in combination with 6 months of androgen deprivation therapy. By showing an improved metastasis-free survival with ENRT, this trial establishes ENRT as a potential standard treatment approach, awaiting a phase 3 trial confirming these results.

In Europe, sarcoptic mange appears to be the prevailing type of mange affecting sheep kept for milk production in the Mediterranean countries. Eprinomectin 5 mg/mL topical solution (EPRINEX® Multi, Boehringer Ingelheim) was recently authorized for the treatment of gastrointestinal and pulmonary nematodes and Oestrus ovis in sheep with zero hours milk withdrawal in several countries in Europe. As the product in cattle has claims against a broad range of parasites including sarcoptic mange mites, the therapeutic efficacy of the product was evaluated in dairy sheep with naturally acquired S. scabiei infestation in two field efficacy study (25 sheep per study) and one controlled, masked clinical study (22 sheep) conducted in Greece. In the field studies, all animals were administered twice, two weeks apart (Days 0 and 14), eprinomectin 5 mg/mL topical solution at 14 mL per animal pour on, based on the body weight measured for the visually estimated heaviest five animals in each study. In the controlled study, animals were ranked by decreasing pre-treatment live mite count, formed in blocks of two animals and randomly assigned to one of two groups to remain untreated (control) or to be administered twice, two weeks apart, eprinomectin 5 mg/mL topical solution at 1 mL per 5 kg body weight pour on. Skin scrapings were collected prior to treatment and at intervals for eight weeks after the first treatment to establish live Sarcoptes mite counts. A 'Mange Clinical Score' was established for each animal using a 5-category scoring system at each sampling. Mite counts of the eprinomectin 5 mg/mL topical solution-treated animals were significantly (p < 0.0001) lower than the pre-treatment counts in the field studies or those of the controls in the controlled study, on all occasions post-treatment. All treated animals had zero live mite counts at 28 days after the first treatment and at the subsequent occasions until the end of the studies (Day 56). All untreated animals in the controlled study remained infested throughout the study. The 'Mange Clinical Score' of the eprinomectin 5 mg/mL topical solution-treated animals, compared either to the pre-treatment scores in the animals in the field studies or to the scores of the controls in the controlled study, improved significantly (p < 0.05) from Day 7 or Day 14, respectively. At the end of the studies, 56 of the 61 treated sheep had healthy skin and did not show clinical symptoms associated with sarcoptic mange, while five animals still presented small, reddened skin areas and some itching despite demonstrating zero mite counts over four weeks. The administration of the treatments was well accepted by all animals and no health problems were observed throughout the studies. This series of studies demonstrated eprinomectin 5 mg/mL topical solution when administered twice, two weeks apart, to be an efficacious and safe treatment against ovine sarcoptic mange.",Fankhauser B,Boehringer Ingelheim Animal Health USA,sotiraki@elgo.gr.

To consolidate this questionnaire on violence in perinatal care with insights from women and their representatives. We conducted a qualitative study, abiding by the COREQ criteria, based on semi-guided interviews held with 16 women and three representatives of perinatal patient organisations. Women were recruited via social media and targeted outreach. The interviews explored their understanding of the questionnaire, its relevance to their experiences, and potential areas for improvement. Data was transcribed and thematically analyzed. Participants appreciated the questionnaire's brevity and endorsed its use of the term 'violence', validating its focus on subjective experiences. However, they highlighted unclear items, such as assessing health professionals' experience or evidence-based care. Suggested additions included categories of infantilizing language, as well as specific roles like radiologists and anesthetists. The nested aspect of the questionnaire was also discussed. Divergent opinions emerged regarding the timing of administration of the questionnaire, some favoring postpartum hospital stay and others suggesting later follow-up. This study highlighted the importance of including women to ensure the tool's relevance and comprehensiveness. Revisions enhanced clarity, expanded the scope of professional interactions assessed, and introduced nuanced categories of violence.

DNA methylation and hydroxymethylation play crucial roles in the regulation of gene expression. This study investigated the effects of metformin on the DNA methylation landscape in a rat model of cecal ligation and puncture (CLP)-induced SLI. Reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS) and oxidative RRBS (ox-RRBS) were used to assess global DNA methylation and hydroxymethylation patterns in the liver tissues. The results showed that CLP-induced SLI was associated with global DNA hypomethylation and hyperhydroxymethylation, which were partially reversed by metformin treatment. The expression levels of DNA methyltransferases and ten-eleven translocation 2 (TET2) were elevated in the CLP group and were modulated by metformin. Functional enrichment analysis of differentially methylated and hydroxymethylated genes revealed their involvement in oxidative phosphorylation and metabolic pathways. Furthermore, integration of DNA methylation, hydroxymethylation, and transcriptome data identified two genes, A1cf and Atxn7l1, that exhibited increased methylation and decreased expression in CLP, which were reversed by metformin treatment. These findings provide novel insights into the epigenetic mechanisms underlying SLI and suggest that metformin exerts hepatoprotective effects by modulating DNA methylation and hydroxymethylation.",,,suntongwen@163.com.

Eligibility criteria: Based on pre-established Populations, Exposures, Comparators, Outcomes, and Study Type (PECOS) criteria, studies in experimental animals of the following study types were included: chronic cancer bioassays, initiation-(co-)promotion studies, and studies with tumor-prone animals. MEDLINE (PubMed), Science Citation Index Expanded and Emerging Sources Citation Index (Web of Science), and the EMF Portal. Data abstraction and synthesis: Data are publicly available online as interactive visuals with downloadable metadata. We adapted the risk-of-bias (RoB) tool developed by Office of Health Assessment and Translation (OHAT) to include considerations pertinent to the evaluation of RF EMF exposure and cancer bioassays. Study sensitivity was assessed with a tool adopted from the Report on Carcinogens (RoC). We synthesized studies using a narrative approach. Effect size was calculated as the 1% Bayesian Average benchmark dose (BMD) of a respective study when dose-response or a trend was identified (see BMDAnalysisSupplementaryMaterial) (Supplement 1). Evidence Assessment: Certainty of the evidence (CoE) was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Developing and Evaluations (GRADE) approach, as refined by OHAT. Evidence from chronic cancer bioassays was considered the most directly applicable to evaluation of carcinogenicity. We included 52 studies with 20 chronic bioassays No studies were excluded based on risk of bias concerns. Studies were not considered suitable for meta-analysis due to heterogeneity in study design, species, strain, sex, exposure characteristics, and cancer outcome. No or minimal evidence of RF EMF exposure-related cancer outcomes was found in most systems or organs in any study (these included gastrointestinal/digestive, kidney, mammary gland, urinary, endocrine, musculoskeletal, reproductive, and auditory). For lymphoma (18 studies), with 6 chronic bioassays (1,120 mice, 1,780 rats) inconsistency between two chronic bioassays was not plausibly explainable, and the CoE for lymphoma was rated 'moderate'. For brain tumors (20 studies), including 5 chronic bioassays (1,902 mice, 6,011 rats), an increase in glial cell-derived neoplasms was reported in two chronic bioassays in male rats. The CoE for an increased risk in glioma was judged as high. The BMD analysis was statistically significant for only one study and the BMD was 4.25 (95% CI 2.70, 10.24). For neoplasms of the heart (4 chronic bioassays with 6 experiments), 3 studies were performed in rats (∼2,165 animals), and 1 in mice (∼720 animals). Based on 2 bioassays, statistically significant increases in malignant schwannomas was judged as high CoE for an increase in heart schwannomas in male rats. The BMDs from the two positive studies were 1.92 (95 %CI 0.71, 4.15) and 0.177 (95 %CI 0.125, 0.241), respectively. Twelve studies reported neoplasms in the adrenal gland (5 chronic bioassays). The CoE for an increased risk in pheochromocytoma was judged as moderate. None of these findings were dose-dependent when compared to the sham controls. Sixteen studies investigated tumors of the liver with 5 of these being chronic bioassays. The CoE was evaluated as moderate for hepatoblastomas. For neoplasms of the lung (3 chronic bioassays), 8 studies were conducted in rats (∼1,296 animals) and 23 studies in mice (∼2,800 animals). In one chronic bioassay, a statistically significant positive trend was reported for bronchoalveolar adenoma or carcinoma (combined), which was rated as moderate CoE for an increase in lung neoplasms with some evidence from 2 initiation-(co-)promotion studies. Meta-analysis was considered inappropriate due to the heterogeneity in study methods. The GRADE/OHAT CoE framework has not been frequently applied to animal studies and experience to date suggests refinements are needed. We referred to standard methods in environmental health where CoE is framed in the context of strength of the evidence providing positive support for carcinogenicity. High CoE can be interpreted as the true effect is highly likely to be reflected in the apparent relationship. Moderate CoE indicates the true effect may be reflected in the apparent relationship. Cancer bioassays conducted in experimental animals are commonly used to identify potential human carcinogens. We note that the two tumor types with high CoE in animals in this systematic review are the same as those identified with limited evidence in humans by the IARC Working Group. However, even in cases where the animal evidence demonstrates high CoE, the extrapolation of risk from cancer bioassays to humans is particularly complex for RF EMF. Without a better understanding of the mechanism of the carcinogenicity of RF-EMF, the choice of exposure metric for risk extrapolation (whole body versus localized), intensity or cumulative exposure, whether or not a monotonic dose-response holds for carcinogenic effects, and whether SAR is the appropriate dose metric for adverse effects induced by RF-EMF, may be critical. This review was partially funded by the WHO radioprotection programme. The protocol for this review was registered in Prospero reg. no. CRD42021265563 and published in Environment International 2022 (Mevissen et al. 2022).",Ward JM; McNamee JP,Global VetPathology; Non-Ionizing Radiation Health Sciences Division,meike.mevissen@unibe.ch.

We explored factors associated with influenza vaccine uptake using the World Health Organization's Strategic Advisory Group on Immunization (SAGE) 3C (confidence, complacency, convenience) model of vaccine hesitancy. The present study forms part of the Bambisana project, a mixed-methods pre-test-post-test intervention study conducted from 29 April 2023 to 15 April 2024. Participants ≥18 years were enrolled in six Focus Group Discussions (FGDs), stratified by age (≥18-34 and ≥ 35 years). FGDs were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim, and coded in Dedoose using framework analysis. Among the 48 participants, most (66.7 %, n = 30) were aged 18-34 years, 65.9 % (n = 29) had completed high school, and 70.2 % (n = 33) were unemployed. Overall, influenza vaccine uptake was associated with three key factors: low confidence, high complacency, and a lack of convenience. Low confidence in the influenza vaccine was associated with negative experiences with COVID-19 vaccines, fear of side effects, vaccine misconceptions, fear of needles, mistrust of public health institutions, and concerns about vaccine effectiveness. Complacency factors included reliance upon traditional and alternative medicines, lack of knowledge about vaccines, and minimising the seriousness of influenza illness. Convenience factors included perceived costs of the vaccine and a lack of influenza vaccine promotion. Addressing confidence, complacency and convenience factors is important to increase influenza vaccine acceptance and uptake in South Africa.",,,janan.dietrich@wits.ac.za.

40338972,Detection of Haemophilus ducreyi from environmental and animal samples in Cameroon.,,PLoS neglected tropical diseases,10.1371/journal.pntd.0013091,"Children in parts of Africa, the South Pacific, and Southeast Asia frequently develop cutaneous ulcers caused by two bacteria: Haemophilus ducreyi (HD) and Treponema pallidum subspecies pertenue (causative agent of yaws). The World Health Organization (WHO) aims to eradicate yaws using mass administration of azithromycin. This also leads to a temporary decrease in ulcers caused by HD followed by a rebound suggesting an ongoing reservoir of infection. The aim of this study was to investigate whether HD could spread through the environment or animals. Alongside detection of human cases of cutaneous ulcers from villages in Cameroon, we additionally collected samples from animals (dogs, cats, flies), fomites (bedsheets, clothing, benches, doors), and water sources (marigots and lakes). DNA was extracted and tested for HD and T. pallidum using two specific qPCR assays. HD was not detected in any of the environmental samples but it was on both clothing (13.3%) and in flies (27%). Flies also tested positive for T. pallidum, but at a lower rate (2.6%). These results suggest that flies and some fomites may contribute to the transmission of HD. Future research should focus on determining whether either of these are capable of carrying live bacteria that can cause onward transmission.",Ndzomo P; Tchatchouang S; Crucitti T; Eyangoh S,Experimental Bacteriology Unit; Centre Pasteur du Cameroun,

A new day-care management approach (DCA) was implemented in primary-level healthcare facilities in urban and rural areas of Bangladesh. Reliable cost estimates are important to determine the economic viability of the new management approach. The objective of this study were to estimate the mean societal cost per patient for a new Day-care approach (DCA) in managing childhood severe pneumonia, to assess cost variation in urban and rural healthcare settings, and to determine important cost predictors. This study was conducted alongside a cluster randomized trial conducted in Bangladesh Children diagnosed with severe pneumonia were enrolled between November 2015 and March 2019. Employing a bottom-up micro-costing approach from a societal perspective, detailed household and provider cost data were collected from sixteen intervention facilities (n = 16). Data collection involved structured questionnaires administered face-to-face with facility staff, interviews with parents/caregivers, and patient record reviews. Analysis measured mean cost and cost variation across socio-economic groups, facility location, clinical variables, and determined cost-sensitive parameters. A p-value of < 0.05 was considered as statistically significant level. 1,745 children were enrolled, 63% were male, and 57% were less than a year old. The mean societal cost per patient was US$94.2 (95% CI: US$92.2, US$96.3) with a mean length-of-stay (LoS) of 4.1 days (SD ± 3.0). Costs of medical personnel (US$32.6), caregiver's productivity loss (US$26) and medicines (US$22) were the major cost contributors. Mean cost was significantly higher for urban-located facilities compared to rural (difference US$17, 95% CI: US$12.6, US$20.8). No cost variation was found by age, sex, and clinical variables. Findings suggest that this novel DCA management approach is a low-cost management option, and particularly beneficial for rural residences and therefore has the potential to reduce the overall cost burden for childhood severe pneumonia management. These findings have implications for policy-making decisions in resource-poor settings for childhood pneumonia management.",Alam NH; Ali N; Faruque ASG; Nasrin S; Chisti MJ; Ahmed T,Nutrition Research Division; icddr,

Although intravenous (IV) ketamine is not approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for TRD, esketamine, an FDA-approved therapeutic, has contributed to the widespread clinical use of off-label IV ketamine across the United States. This scoping review highlights significant shifts in ketamine therapy, particularly after FDA approval of esketamine, the impact of COVID-19 on treatment accessibility, and increased regulatory scrutiny from the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) and FDA. What are the current practice patterns, patient demographics, and barriers to accessing ketamine for psychiatric disorders, particularly TRD? This scoping review focused on provider utilization patterns (including frequency of ketamine administration, provider roles, and treatment settings), preferred administration methods (IV infusions, intramuscular injections, and other routes), and patient characteristics (age, sex, socioeconomic status, and primary psychiatric diagnoses treated). The Web of Science, PubMed, CBM, MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, University Theses, and Embase databases were searched. Two survey-based studies were included. IV administration was the most common method of administration reported in both studies, with alternative methods such as intramuscular and sublingual routes emerging in limited use. Patients receiving ketamine therapy were predominantly middle aged (36-64 years old), with financial barriers identified as a notable obstacle because of limited insurance coverage. Access to ketamine was limited in rural areas, illustrating the need for expanded provider networks. Private clinics exhibited greater flexibility in treatment approaches than hospital settings, which adhered to standardized protocols. The absence of long-term outcome data and variability in treatment protocols emphasize the need for standardized practices and further research. This scoping review highlights the widespread use of ketamine for TRD, but reveals significant variability in practice patterns and accessibility barriers. Findings emphasize the need for standardized protocols, expanded insurance coverage, and further research to optimize the role of ketamine in psychiatric care.",Aslam AM; Muir O,Fermata Health,

The present systematic scoping review aims to identify the categories of non-verbal joint actions investigated so far, the experimental tasks and INC measures used, and the related main findings to provide a comprehensive overview of the field. Thirty-nintharticles were included in this review. Most studies investigated cooperative and simultaneous joint actions performed with either similar or complementary actions, whereas competitive and turn-based joint actions are under-investigated. Tasks involve interactions mainly based on movement, music, or computer, with movement-based tasks being most relevant to social neuroscience. Several INC approaches were used, with graph theory and phase synchrony being the commonly used. The main findings are organized and discussed according to the analytical approaches used and, for each approach, into groups of joint action categories and tasks. By providing a structured classification of joint action types and highlighting the relationship between tasks and INC methods, this review offers a reference for designing future studies and refining methodological approaches in EEG-hyperscanning research on social interaction.",,,

To use a patient-centered instrument to measure adverse experiences in vulvovaginal care. Common themes from National Vulvodynia Association patient testimonials were used to design a mixed-methods measure of patient experience that included both quantitative and qualitative questions. An instrument was created and submitted to officers from the National Vulvodynia Association and Tight-Lipped, another patient advocacy organization, for feedback. The measure was then completed by patients before their first appointment at a vulvovaginal disorder referral clinic from August 2023 to February 2024. Participation in the survey. The primary outcome was the incidence of reported clinician behavior and consequent distress as reported on the survey instrument. Quantitative data were analyzed using simple descriptive statistics (mean [SD], median [IQR], and percentage). Narrative responses provided by patients were analyzed using the clinical-qualitative method for content analysis. A total of 520 patients completed surveys; 5 were eliminated because the patient was younger than 18 years, 6 were eliminated for duplication, 6 were eliminated because they had no past clinician, and 56 were eliminated for completely blank responses. Thus, surveys of 447 patients (mean [SD] age, 41.7 [15.2] years) were analyzed (86% response rate). Patients had a mean (SD) of 5.50 (4.53) past clinicians. Patients reported that a mean (SD) of 43.5% (33.9%) of past practitioners were supportive, 26.6% (31.7%) were belittling, and 20.5% (30.9%) did not believe the patient. In total, 186 patients (41.6%) were told they just needed to relax more, 92 (20.6%) were recommended to drink alcohol, 236 (52.8%) considered ceasing care because their concerns were not addressed, 92 (20.6%) were referred to psychiatry without medical treatment, 72 (16.8%) felt unsafe during a medical encounter, and 176 (39.4%) said they were made to feel crazy, the most distressing surveyed behavior (rated at a mean [SD] of 7.39 [3.06] of 10 on a numerical rating scale of distress).

However, the benefits of such collaboration in patients with stage 5 CKD remain unclear. We conducted a retrospective cohort study of adult outpatients with stage 5 CKD across nine nephrology centers in Japan. The exposure of interest was primary care physician-nephrologist collaboration. We examined the association between primary care physician-nephrologist collaboration and clinical outcomes in adult outpatients with stage 5 CKD: dialysis initiation and cause-specific hospitalizations using the Fine-Gray models, which treat death and preemptive kidney transplantation and death and kidney replacement therapy as competing risk events, respectively. Of the 570 patients included in the analysis, 91 (16.0%) received primary care physician-nephrologist collaboration, whereas the remaining patients were treated by nephrologists alone. During a median follow-up of 1.4 years, 399 (70.0%) patients started dialysis, 11 (1.9%) received preemptive kidney transplantation, and 53 (9.3%) died. There were no significant between-group differences in dialysis initiation and CKD- and cardiovascular-related hospitalizations (adjusted subdistribution hazard ratio [SHR] [95% confidence interval], 0.89 [0.64-1.23], 1.22 [0.78-1.90], and 0.95 [0.46-1.98], respectively). However, primary care physician-nephrologist collaboration was associated with a lower risk of infection-related hospitalization (adjusted SHR [95% confidence interval], 0.36 [0.15-0.87]).

Two primary objectives of the ERAS philosophy have been the standardization of practices and the reduction of variations in treatment. A notable achievement of ERAS has been its ability to enhance and combine into bundles elements that were already well-known but disconnected in clinical practice, such as preadmission, prehabilitation, and multimodal analgesia. Key concepts of ERAS pathways include multimodal, optimization, early and minimal; while the essential principles for success are research, education, and audit. Current literature suggests that a compliance rate of over 70% is associated with better clinical outcomes and improved survival rates. However, it is not yet possible to determine which specific elements are the most critical for ERAS outcomes, nor it is easy to demonstrate which combinations of items are best suited to individual patients. Three types of barriers (cultural, organizational, and structural) can be highlighted as opponents to ERAS implementation. The concept of partial ERAS is gaining increased interest. Adhering to ERAS protocols was not easy, as it required anesthetists to step outside the confines of the operating room, both physically and culturally, and to consciously assume the role of clinical support to surgeons and their patients.

In July 2022, we implemented a protocol where TNCs replaced physicians responding to Level III trauma activations. Data from the trauma registry and electronic medical records were analyzed before and after implementation. The primary outcome was time to computed tomography within 30 minutes. Secondary outcomes were emergency department (ED) time, hospital length of stay (LOS), and 30-day readmissions. The final analysis included 812 post-intervention patients (562 with TNCs, 250 without TNCs), of which 53% were male. Groups were comparable in age and Injury Severity Score at baseline. Patients seen by TNCs were more likely to receive computed tomography (CT) within 30 minutes (56% vs 35%, p < .0001), while ED and hospital LOS and readmission rates showed no significant difference between groups.

Cell physiology,10.1152/ajpcell.00186.2025,"Despite the high prevalence of Achilles tendinopathy, clinically-relevant animal models of Achilles tendinopathy are lacking. Previous studies have demonstrated possible tendinopathic cell and matrix changes with high-speed treadmill running, but the consistency as well as functional and mechanical consequences of these changes were unclear. We sought to determine the applicability of this protocol as a tendinopathy model by defining changes in Achilles tendon structure, function, and mechanics associated with 16 weeks of high-speed treadmill running (26.8 m/min, 60 min/day, 5 days/week). We expected high-speed running would induce detrimental structural, functional, and mechanical changes that worsen over the course of the 16-week protocol. Treadmill running did influence bodyweight, hindlimb gait, and tendon cross-sectional area. However, contrary to our hypothesis, treadmill running did not induce tendinopathic changes in matrix organization, cell morphology, or tendon mechanics. As such, alternative strategies for robust and reproducible induction of Achilles tendinopathy in pre-clinical animal models are needed.",,,

The sample consisted of 484 nursing students. Data were collected using a personal information form, the Attitude Towards Pain Assessment Scale (ATPAS), and the Pain Management Self-Efficacy Questionnaire (PMSEQ).ResultsParticipants had a mean PMSEQ and ATPAS score of 72.03 ± 17.13 and 59.61 ± 8.66, respectively. Fourth graders had significantly higher mean PMSEQ and ATPAS scores than other grades. Participants who had received training in pain management before had significantly higher mean PMSEQ and ATPAS scores than those who had not. Participants who always encountered patients in pain had significantly higher mean PMSEQ and ATPAS scores than those who did not. Participants who used pain scales had significantly higher mean PMSEQ and ATPAS scores than those who did not. Participants who always assessed pain had significantly higher mean PMSEQ and ATPAS scores than those who did not. Participants who believed pain assessment was absolutely necessary had significantly higher mean PMSEQ and ATPAS scores than those who did not. There was a weak positive correlation between PMSEQ and ATPAS scores.ConclusionNursing students have compatible pain assessment self-efficacy and positive attitudes toward pain assessment. As nursing students become more capable of assessing pain, they develop more positive attitudes toward it.",,,

While there is significant demand for new employment post-ABI, much less is known about this return-to-work (RTW) pathway.ObjectiveTo compare and contrast the clinical profiles and outcomes achieved through vocational rehabilitation (VR) following severe ABI according to RTW pathway.MethodsSecondary data analysis of the Vocational Intervention Program efficacy trial (VIP1.0). Participants with severe ABI undertaking a VR program were re-classified into two RTW pathway groups: return to pre-injury employment (Fast-Track; FT) or obtaining new employment (New-Track; NT). Competitive employment status (Yes/No) and clinician ratings of disability and participation were collected pre- and post-intervention and at 3-month follow-up.Results47 (46%) participants undertook a FT pathway and 55 (54%) a NT pathway. Compared to FT, NT participants were less educated, more likely to be single, further post-injury, already attempted to RTW unsuccessfully post-injury, and less likely to complete the VR intervention. For both pathways, employment rates improved from pre- to post-intervention and remained stable at follow-up. While FT was associated with high RTW success (post-intervention: 89%; follow-up: 88%), a significant minority of NT participants also achieved competitive employment (post-intervention: 34%; follow-up: 45%). FT participants were also rated as demonstrating greater improvements in work-related participation from pre- to post-intervention than NT.ConclusionsDespite its challenges, VR interventions targeting new employment can lead to beneficial RTW outcomes for many individuals unable to return to their previous employer following severe ABI.",,,

However, there is a lack of tools to measure the competencies of GDM management among obstetric nurses. The questionnaire was developed in two stages: (a) creation of an initial questionnaire based on the definition of competency, literature review, and semi-structured interviews, followed by two rounds of Delphi expert inquiry; (b) evaluation of the questionnaire via piloting study on 30 obstetric nurses and testing of validity and reliability on 239 obstetric nurses. A questionnaire containing dimensions of professional knowledge, professional skills, professional competence and personal attitude was developed. Correlation analysis revealed statistically significant correlations ( This study developed an assessment tool for evaluating the management ability of obstetric nurses for GDM patients, which consists of four dimensions and 35 items. The dimensions and items demonstrate the content of the competence theory, and the questionnaire shows good stability and reliability and validity. It is recommended that healthcare institutions integrate this questionnaire into training and evaluation programs for obstetric nurses to improve care quality for GDM patients.

Tétouan, Morocco, is among the most affected cities in the country; however, limited information is available on the impact of TB and its treatment on various aspects of patients' lives. This study aims to comprehensively analyze the clinical, microbiological, nutritional, and psychosocial characteristics of patients undergoing intensive pulmonary TB treatment in Tétouan. We conducted a 1.5-year prospective study on patients with bacteriologically confirmed pulmonary TB during the intensive treatment phase. Clinical, social, psychological, and nutritional data were collected, and bacteriological monitoring was performed. Statistical analysis was conducted using SPSS software (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY), with a 95% significance level. Among the 125 surveyed patients (mean age: 37.5 years, male-to-female ratio: 3.8), 91 (73.2%) resided in urban areas, 19 (15.4%) had difficulties reaching a healthcare center, and 89 (71%) were newly diagnosed. Side effects were reported by 121 patients (97%), primarily muscle and joint pain. A balanced diet was maintained by 80 patients (63.9%) during treatment. Anxiety was observed in 102 patients (82%) and correlated with female gender, retreatment cases, smoking, side effects, and living in urban areas. Depression was experienced by 113 patients (91%), significantly associated with smoking, side effects, and retreatment cases. The sputum conversion rate was low (62.4%) and showed a significant correlation with symptom progression after two months of intensive treatment. Consistent patient support throughout the entire treatment period is crucial to preventing dropout and treatment failure. Greater efforts are needed to strengthen economic, social, and psychological support for patients. Healthcare educational units play a key role in informing patients about nutrition, potential side effects, and nicotine withdrawal symptoms. These interventions are essential to enhancing adherence and improving overall treatment outcomes in Tétouan.",,,

The aim of this systematic review was to provide an update on the various clinical and logistical reasons for ENIs and observe their nutritional implications. PubMed, MEDLINE, Embase, and The Cochrane Library were searched from the inception of each database until March 11, 2024. For data extraction, a structured checklist was used. The initial literature search yielded 522 results. In total, 26 studies were included, comprising 3067 participants. Among the included studies, there were 20 prospective studies, two before-and-after studies, one RCT, and three retrospective studies. The main reasons for ENI were high gastric residual volumes, nasogastric tube dysfunction, and diagnostic and surgical procedures. In conclusion, although the nutritional management of critically ill patients in the ICU has improved drastically, ENIs remain a major problem in clinical practice. Future research should consider different treatments and ICU protocols. Additionally, there is a need for standardized ENI definitions and standardized reporting of the evaluation of energy and/or protein requirements, objectively determining adequate intake, and reporting the causes, frequency, and duration of ENIs.",,,

40337573,"Psychological Distress and Coping Mechanisms Among Women Diagnosed With Breast Cancer: A Cross-Sectional Study of Anxiety, Depression, and Social Support.",,Cureus,10.7759/cureus.81831,"Introduction Breast cancer is one of the most prevalent malignancies and a leading cause of cancer-related mortality among women. Beyond its physical impact, it significantly affects mental health, leading to anxiety, depression, and psychological distress. Coping mechanisms and social support play a crucial role in emotional resilience; however, limited research has examined these factors in Pakistani women. This study investigates the relationship between psychological distress, coping strategies, and social support among women diagnosed with breast cancer. Method This cross-sectional study included 100 women (N = 100, 100% female) diagnosed with breast cancer, recruited from private hospitals and clinics. Standardized instruments assessed generalized anxiety (Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item scale (GAD-7)), depression (Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) 9-item scale), coping strategies (Brief Coping Orientation to Problems Experienced (COPE) Inventory 28-item scale), and social support (Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support (MSPSS) 12-item scale). Data analysis was conducted using IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, Version 26 (Released 2019; IBM Corp., Armonk, New York, United States), employing correlation analysis and group comparisons based on education, employment, and chemotherapy history. Results Higher generalized anxiety levels correlated with increased use of coping mechanisms (r = 0.133, p < 0.01), while perceived social support was positively associated with coping responses (r = 0.130, p < 0.01). Participants receiving chemotherapy reported higher social support (p = 0.016, Cohen's d = 0.71), whereas non-recipients exhibited more significant depression (p = 0.001, Cohen's d = 0.75).

40337565,Machine Learning Nomogram for Predicting Dengue Shock Syndrome in Pediatric Patients With Dengue Fever in Vietnam.,,Cureus,10.7759/cureus.81819,"Background Early identification of pediatric patients at high risk for dengue shock syndrome (DSS) is crucial to enable timely and appropriate clinical interventions. However, the application of machine learning (ML) models for predicting DSS risk remains underexplored. Objective This study aimed to develop and validate a ML-based nomogram for predicting DSS risk in pediatric patients with dengue fever, supporting clinical decision-making. Methods A prospective study was conducted on 230 children with dengue fever admitted to Can Tho Children's Hospital, Vietnam, from January 2020 to December 2022. Clinical and laboratory data were collected and analyzed using R software (version 4.4.1). Six ML algorithms were used to develop risk prediction models for hospitalized pediatric patients with dengue, and their predictive performances were compared. The best-performing model was used to construct a nomogram for DSS prediction. Model performance was evaluated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC), and the calibration of the nomogram was assessed using a calibration curve. Results Among the 230 dengue patients enrolled, 124 (53.9%) were male, with a median age of 11 years (IQR: 8-13 years). The cohort was randomly divided into a training set (n = 173) and a test set (n = 57). Five key predictors selected for the nomogram were albumin, activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), fibrinogen, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and platelet count. In the test set, the AUROC for the six models ranged from 0.888 to 0.945. The random forest model demonstrated the best performance, with an AUROC of 0.945 (95% CI: 0.886-1.000), an accuracy of 0.951 (95% CI: 0.865-0.989), sensitivity of 0.894, specificity of 0.976, and a Kappa score of 0.884. Conclusions ML-based models can be established and potentially help identify hospitalized pediatric patients with dengue who are at high risk of progressing to DSS. The proposed nomogram may be a valuable tool for predicting DSS in clinical practice.",,,

This study evaluates the impact of a new breath-indicating device, ApnoLight (PEMDx Pty Ltd, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia), on medical staff's accuracy in recording respiratory rates and detecting apneic events, along with the device's acceptance among nurses. Twenty-five nurses from a hospital in Brisbane, Australia, participated. A simulated patient was fitted with the ApnoLight device on an oxygen mask. Nurses conducted six respiratory rate observations at varying distances (bedside, two meters, and five meters), both with and without the device. The patient's respiratory rates varied from eight to 25 breaths per minute. The accuracy of respiratory rate recordings and the time to identify apnea events were compared between simple observation and device-assisted observations. The ApnoLight significantly reduced error rates in respiratory rate recordings: 27.58% at the bedside (P = 0.09, t = 1.31), 90.99% at two meters (P = 0.02, t = 1.98), and 96.37% at five meters (P = 0.0002, t = 4.02). The mean time to identify apnea decreased from 12.96 ± 9.12 seconds (simple observation) to 7.42 ± 2.19 seconds (with ApnoLight device). All apnea events were identified with the device, whereas four were undetected without it. Feedback showed that 96% (N = 24) of nurses found the device improved respiratory rate accuracy, and 100% (N = 25) found it made apnea identification easier. The ApnoLight device has the potential to enhance respiratory rate monitoring accuracy and apnea detection in postoperative settings. Its implementation could improve patient safety and streamline clinical workflows.",,,
40337559,Frank's Sign: A Clinical Predictor of Ischaemic Strokes.,,Cureus,10.7759/cureus.81812,"Frank's sign is a diagonal crease on the earlobe and has been linked to cardiovascular disease. This prospective observational study aimed to assess the association between Frank's sign and ischaemic strokes. Conducted over three months in a UK district general hospital, the study analysed data from 137 consecutive patients admitted to stroke and elderly care wards. Patient records included demographic and medical history data, and physical examinations identified the presence of Frank's sign. Statistical analysis using the chi-squared test demonstrated a significant association between ischaemic strokes and Frank's sign, even after excluding patients with pre-existing cardiovascular disease. These findings suggest Frank's sign could serve as a clinical predictor for ischaemic stroke. Recognizing this sign may help healthcare providers identify at-risk individuals and implement preventative strategies for managing stroke risk factors.

Time is the single most critical factor in the management of patients presenting with AIS, where re-opening of occluded blood vessels is paramount. Intra-arterial thrombolysis (IAT) and mechanical thrombectomy (MT) are two such therapies employed to reestablish cerebrovascular blood flow in patients with AIS. This review compares both IAT and MT according to their efficacy, safety profiles, recanalization rates, clinical outcomes, and adverse procedural events. Study abstraction from electronic search databases comprising PubMed/MEDLINE, ResearchGate, and the National Library of Medicine was used. Screening and selection of relevant articles were comprehensively conducted for this review. Direct comparisons between IAT and MT in terms of variables including recanalization rates, clinical outcomes, and adverse procedural events were warranted for study inclusion. Research determined to exhibit insufficient data or without comparable groups were subsequently excluded. MT was prompter when executing procedures than IAT, achieving greater rates of recanalization. Both interventions displayed similar results regarding rates of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (sICH) and mortality. Despite current available data indicating MT to demonstrate more efficiency as a procedure, further research is needed to examine IAT in light of specific patient demographics, clinical presentation, and circumstances. This review elucidated that MT often takes less time peri-procedurally, achieving greater success in revascularization compared with that of IAT. Regarding mortality and sICH rates, IAT and MT comparison showed equivocal results. Thus, while making therapeutic decisions, it is important to consider the unique clinical features of each patient as well as the timing of interventions in order to maximize treatment outcomes.",Bekele BA; Uwishema O; Adam AH; Gashu AD; Kachouh C; Mshaymesh S; Wellington J,Department of Research and Education,

We present the case of a 29-year-old male patient from Medellín, Colombia, who experienced delayed-onset neuropsychiatric symptoms secondary to chronic lead exposure from a retained bullet fragment in the left ankle, following a firearm injury sustained 13 years earlier. The patient initially presented with essential tremor in both upper and lower limbs, nausea, vomiting, subjective fever, a metallic taste in the mouth, mood disturbances, significant unintentional weight loss, and chronic mixed-type ankle pain with localized edema. A blue line on the gums (Burton's line) was observed on physical examination, raising suspicion for lead poisoning. Blood lead level testing confirmed severely elevated levels, supporting the diagnosis of chronic lead intoxication. Additional laboratory tests revealed moderate to severe normocytic anemia and transiently elevated serum creatinine. Despite the persistence of symptoms for approximately three years, diagnosis and treatment were delayed. The bullet was surgically removed after approximately seven months of clinical deterioration. The case highlights the systemic impact of chronic lead exposure and the importance of recognizing non-occupational sources, such as retained ammunition fragments, as potential causes. This report emphasizes the need for early recognition of atypical neuropsychiatric presentations, particularly in patients with a history of trauma or exposure to heavy metals. It also reinforces the relevance of integrating clinical findings with occupational and environmental history to guide diagnosis. Lead intoxication remains a significant public health issue, especially in regions with limited regulation or awareness, and should be considered in the differential diagnosis of unexplained systemic and cognitive symptoms.",Galindo C; Franco J,Psychiatry; General Medicine,

However, its clinical utility remains uncertain due to inconsistent evidence, challenges in donor availability, and risks of alloimmunization. Here, we evaluated granulocyte transfusions administered to 35 pediatric and adult patients at our institution. Materials and methods A retrospective chart review was conducted for 35 patients who received granulocyte transfusions between 2009 and 2024. Patient data included demographics, primary diagnosis, infection type, infection site, average granulocyte count in the units, average granulocyte dose, human leukocyte antigen-calculated panel reactive antibody (HLA-cPRA) Class I and II IgG antibodies, 42- and 90-day survival, average post-transfusion absolute neutrophil count (ANC) increment, and number of transfusions. Binomial logistic regression analysis was performed to determine the clinical variables associated with increased survival. Results Overall survival at 42 and 90 days was 21/35 (60%) and 20/35 (57%), respectively. No significant survival differences were observed based on infection type, diagnosis, or sex.

Among them, odontogenic carcinosarcoma (OCS) is an exceptionally rare and aggressive malignant neoplasm originating from dental tissues. First recognized by the World Health Organization (WHO) in 1992, OCS is characterized by high-grade biphasic malignant epithelial and mesenchymal components, contributing to its aggressive clinical behavior. OCS often presents with nonspecific symptoms such as pain, swelling, and loosening of teeth, which complicate early diagnosis. Its rarity adds to the diagnostic challenges, frequently leading to delays in identification. Histopathological evaluation remains the cornerstone for accurate diagnosis, distinguishing OCS from other odontogenic tumors through features like epithelial nuclear pleomorphism, mitotic activity, and mesenchymal sarcomatous differentiation. Management typically involves surgical resection with clear margins, while adjuvant therapies such as chemotherapy and radiation are considered in select cases. Recent advancements in molecular oncology and surgical techniques, including robotic-assisted procedures and 3D-printed reconstructive aids, offer promising avenues for improving patient outcomes. A multidisciplinary approach and ongoing research are essential to enhance diagnostic accuracy, refine treatment protocols, and improve the prognosis for patients affected by this rare malignancy.

A two stage meta-analysis of individual participant data in a Cox proportional hazard model was performed using cervical length as a continuous variable. Medline, Embase, Cochrane, and LILACS, among others, were searched to identify eligible studies; the search was from 1 January 2000 to 30 September 2020. Risk of bias was assessed with the QUIPS tool. Studies were from eight countries between 2001 and 2018. Individual participant data were sought for eligible studies that reported mid-trimester (defined between 16 and 26 weeks) transvaginal sonographic cervical length and also gestational age at birth in asymptomatic women with twin pregnancy. The primary outcome was spontaneous preterm birth before 37 weeks. Among 29 eligible studies, authors of 17 studies provided individual participant data for 6437 women with a twin pregnancy (69.1% of individual participant data). Mean cervical length measurement was 39 mm (SD=9, range 1-74 mm). 2889 women (44.9%) delivered before 37 weeks' gestation, and 934 (14.9%) delivered before 34 weeks. Each 1 mm increase in cervical length was associated with a 4.0% reduction in the rate of spontaneous preterm birth before 37 weeks (hazard ratio 0.96 (95% confidence interval 0.95 to 0.97)), and a 6.8% reduction in the rate of spontaneous preterm birth before 34 weeks' gestation (0.93 (0.92 to 0.95)). The prognostic value remained stable in models adjusting for different sets of variables. The prognostic value of cervical length for spontaneous preterm birth in twin pregnancy is on a continuous scale.

ICI re-administration has been reported to have a clinical benefit for patients with lung cancer or melanoma. However, data on patients with AGC have not yet been collected. We plan to conduct a prospective, multicenter, observational NIVO RETURNS study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of nivolumab monotherapy re-administration in patients with AGC refractory to initial anti-PD-1 or anti-programmed cell death ligand-1 (PD-L1) antibody treatment. Patients who have achieved clinical benefits (complete response, partial response, or stable disease for ≥ 6 months) from prior treatment, including anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy, will be included. The primary endpoint will be the objective response rate to nivolumab re-administration. We anticipate that our findings will contribute to the improvement of survival outcomes as later-line treatment for AGC. Patients with advanced gastric or esophagogastric cancer that does not have the HER2 protein are usually treated with a combination of chemotherapy and a type of immunotherapy called an anti-PD-1 antibody. This treatment helps the immune system fight the cancer. However, even if the treatment works at first, the cancer often comes back or stops responding. In some cancers like lung cancer and melanoma, repeating immunotherapy after a break – called re-administration – has shown positive results. But for gastric cancer, there is little information about whether this strategy is helpful. We are planning a research study called the NIVO RETURNS study. It will take place at multiple hospitals and will follow patients over time without changing their treatment plans. The goal is to see if re-administering a drug called nivolumab (an anti-PD-1 antibody) is effective and safe in patients with advanced gastric cancer who were previously treated with similar drugs. We will include patients whose cancer responded well to earlier treatment (such as tumor shrinkage or disease stability for 6 months or more). The main outcome we will measure is how many patients show a positive response to nivolumab re-administration. We hope that this study will help doctors better understand whether restarting immunotherapy can be a useful option for patients with few remaining treatments. Ultimately, we aim to improve the survival and quality of life for people with advanced gastric cancer.",,,

The aim of this study was to evaluate the implementation of this PSIRLS in the district health services of the Western Cape.  A convergent parallel mixed methods study was conducted within a practice-based research network. Qualitative data were collected through 15 semi-structured interviews with purposefully selected respondents from 10 district hospitals and 5 primary care facilities, and the data were thematically analysed. Quantitative data for 2023 were collected from the PSIRLS at 16 facilities and analysed descriptively.  The PSIRLS was adopted by all facilities. Overall, 577 patient safety incidents (PSI) were reported (range 0-148 per facility) with 91% from district hospitals, 18% severity assessment code 1 (SAC1), 33% caused harm and 72% in hospital wards. Staff were prompted to follow the steps by structured forms and the digital system. Patient safety incidents were reported by health professionals, although clinicians were concerned about blame and damaging teamwork. Severity assessment code 1 were reported on time (median 24 h) and investigated promptly (median closure 4 days). Opportunity costs could be significant. While the system improved patient safety, it primarily focussed on behavioural interventions. Austerity measures and the reduction of quality assurance managers posed a threat to the system.  Strengthening training for operational managers and clinical staff, enhancing infrastructure and addressing mental health-related incidents are crucial for long-term success.

Thematic data analysis used MAXQDA version 2020.  Four major themes emerged. Most participants felt a disparity between private and public primary care services, with the latter having optimistic views about health reforms. Further, private general practitioners' clinical skills and competencies needed strengthening, and mixed staffing for primary care teams was envisioned. Many participants had ill-defined ideas about family medicine's impact and prospects but agreed that more resources were needed to improve it.  The study highlights the participants' first-hand involvement in implementing family medicine. The findings may enhance knowledge of primary care services, clinical skills and staff composition. Further research is recommended.Contribution: The study provides insight into recognising family medicine, which preceded the government's efforts to introduce Universal Health Coverage to be funded through the National Health Insurance.",Moosa S,,johnmusonda82@gmail.com.
40336380,Factors influencing student's transition from student to workforce in intensive care units.,2025-05-08,Curationis,10.4102/curationis.v48i1.2718," Staff shortages, the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, increased patient acuity and fiscal restraints contributed to basic nursing students being assigned to intensive care units (ICU). These students, expected to step up and function within the team, were confronted with expectations and situations beyond their clinical preparation for practice. How can we better prepare these students for practice?  To develop recommendations that promote transition programmes that prepare student nurses to become practice-ready novice general nurses to work in the ICU.  The study adopted a sequential explanatory mixed-method. Quantitative data collection was achieved through census sampling and the utilisation of the Casey Fink Practice Readiness Survey. Statistical analyses used IBM SPSS (version 25, IBM Corporation) to identify predictive relationships between practice readiness and identified variables through multi-linear regression. Qualitative data collected through purposive selection and semi-structured focus group discussions were transcribed, coded and analysed through domain analysis.  Four factors affecting nursing students' perceived readiness for practice in the ICU were identified: (1) Support for new general nurses, (2) their need for professional socialisation and belonging, (3) orientation and skill development and (4) rotation and exposure to the ICU.  Multifaceted innovative introduction programmes may assist in preparing the novice general nurse to become practice-ready.Contribution: This article contributes towards a possible solution to bridge the theory-practice gap and positively influence students' transition into the workplace to facilitate retention of novice practitioners beyond their first year of practice in a specialised unit.",Downing C,,leonie.stein@hotmail.com.

Despite this, little research exists on nursing students' experiences with clinical competency evaluations in Namibia. Nurse educators should thus explore nursing students' experiences of clinical competency evaluations in order to establish what challenges they face, as this can be beneficial for nurturing a positive learning environment.  This research assesses nursing students' experiences of clinical competency evaluations in a pre-registration nurse education programme at the Faculty of Health Sciences in Namibia, University of Namibia, Rundu campus.  The study was conducted at a public nurse education institution in Namibia. A qualitative approach was employed utilising an exploratory, contextual and descriptive design. This study was conducted from August 2023 to October 2023 among (second-, third- and fourth-year) nursing students who were enrolled for a Bachelor of Nursing Science (Clinical) (Honours) degree. Data were collected through semi-structured interviews with 16 nursing students being selected using a convenience sampling method. All interviews were audio recorded and transcribed verbatim. A thematic analysis method was utilised to analyse the data.  Three themes emerged in this study: (1) positive experiences of evaluation for clinical competence; (2) negative experiences of evaluation for clinical competence and; (3) recommendations to improve the clinical evaluation of competence.  The results showed that nursing students had both negative and positive experiences during the clinical assessment process. The positive experiences included integrating theory and practice, while negative experiences included the poor attitudes of the clinical evaluators and limited time.Contribution: The results of this study can be used to develop targeted interventions and strategies to improve the challenges students encounter during clinical assessment.",Ashipala DO; Katjimune V,,sitwirajosph17@gmail.com.

This review explores the determinants affecting access to and utilization of post-stroke physical rehabilitation in LMICs. A systematic literature search across multiple databases retrieved 463 articles, of which 35 studies included were from Asia, Africa, and South America met the inclusion criteria. During the review process, 2 additional relevant studies were identified and added. A descriptive synthesis was conducted to identify key determinants influencing rehabilitation access and use. Three major categories of determinants emerged: (1) Contextual factors, including traditional/spiritual beliefs, reliance on alternative medicine, gender disparities, poor awareness, and environmental barriers; (2) Personal factors, such as apathy toward rehabilitation, lack of clinical guidance, and psychological challenges (fatigue, depression, cognitive impairment); (3) Resource-related factors, including high out-of-pocket costs, low provider pay, insufficient infrastructure, inadequate health policies, limited professional training, and poor rehabilitation curricula. Recommendations focus on capacity building, service delivery, extended support, and treatment content. LMICs face unique, context-specific challenges in stroke rehabilitation, requiring tailored solutions. Addressing these barriers necessitates region-specific strategies that align with health system structures, governmental policies, economic resources, professional education, and clinical practice guidance. Rehabilitation providers are encouraged to adopt a clinical decision-making framework that is contextual, patient-centered, and sensitive to available resources.Stroke rehabilitation teams should implement a standardized checklist at discharge and follow-ups.Government and non-government organizations must work to overcome persistent barriers.Policymakers should suppourt by investing in workforce training, strengthening infrastructure, and expanding community-based rehabilitation programs.",,,

In Kenya, effective strategies are needed to scale-up the workforce to meet the demand for depression and post-traumatic stress disorder treatment. Task-shifting - delegating specific tasks to non-specialist workers - is one workforce expansion approach. However, non-specialist workers remain underutilized in Kenya due to a paucity of research on how to scale-up and sustain such service models. Purposive sampling was used to recruit experts from policy, healthcare practice, research, and mental health advocacy roles in Kenya (N = 30). Participants completed concept mapping activities to explore factors likely to facilitate or hinder a collaborative Ministry of Health-researcher training of the mental health non-specialist workforce. Participants brainstormed 71 statements describing determinants and implementation strategies, sorted and rated the importance and changeability of each. Multidimensional scaling and hierarchical cluster analysis quantified relationships between statements. The Exploration, Preparation, Implementation, and Sustainment (EPIS) framework guided cluster interpretation activities. Twelve determinant clusters were identified: 1) Current workforce characteristics, 2) Exploration considerations, 3) Preparation considerations, 4) Sustainment considerations, 5) Inner context implementation processes and tools, 6) Local capacity and partnerships, 7) Financing for community health teams, 8) Outer context resource allocation/policy into action, 9) Workforce characteristics to enhance during implementation, 10) Workforce implementation strategies, 11) Cross-level workforce strategies, and 12) Training and education recommendations. Cluster 8 was rated the most important and changeable. Concept mapping offers a rapid, community-engaged approach for identifying determinants and implementation strategies to address workforce shortages. Organizing results by EPIS phases can help prioritize strategy deployment to achieve implementation goals.

The data was derived from the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) 2021, which covered 204 countries and territories. We reported SHS changes by sex, year and sociodemographic index (SDI) level (a summary measure that identifies where countries or other geographic areas sit on the spectrum of development) from 1990 to 2021. We analyzed the risk-outcome pairs among all age groups to estimate disease burden attributable to SHS exposure and also did a decomposition method to attribute changes in all-cause SHS attributable deaths or disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) to population growth, population aging, and mortality change. Worldwide, the age-standardized summary exposure values (SEV) of SHS exposure in 2021 was 30.6% (28.9 to 31.6) for males and 38.0% (35.5 to 39.0) for females, with a percentage change of -0.2 (-0.2 to -0.1) and -0.3 (-0.3 to -0.2), respectively, since 1990. Among the top 10 countries with the highest SEV, there were mainly high-middle SDI countries for male and low-middle SDI and middle SDI countries for female, respectively. Secondly, about 1.29 million deaths (0.68-1.90) and 34.90 million DALYs (17.95-52.21) were attributable to SHS exposure, and about half of them took place in two countries (China and India). Ischemic heart disease (IHD) (29.67%), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (19.04%), and lower respiratory infections (LRIs) (10.87%) were the three leading causes of SHS associated deaths. Lastly, since 2010, the number of SHS related death significantly increased due to population growth and population aging, despite a decrease in mortality attributable to SHS exposure. Globally, the age-standardized SEV of SHS exposure decreased from 1990 to 2021.

Experimental strategies, including novel immunotherapies and preclinical models, are actively being explored, while established treatments, such as immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), are widely implemented in clinical settings. This comprehensive review examines the historical evolution, underlying mechanisms, and diverse strategies of cancer immunotherapy, highlighting both its clinical applications and ongoing preclinical advancements. The review delves into the essential components of anticancer immunity, including dendritic cell activation, T cell priming, and immune surveillance, while addressing the challenges posed by immune evasion mechanisms. Key immunotherapeutic strategies, such as cancer vaccines, oncolytic viruses, adoptive cell transfer, and ICIs, are discussed in detail. Additionally, the role of nanotechnology, cytokines, chemokines, and adjuvants in enhancing the precision and efficacy of immunotherapies were explored. Combination therapies, particularly those integrating immunotherapy with radiotherapy or chemotherapy, exhibit synergistic potential but necessitate careful management to reduce side effects. Emerging factors influencing immunotherapy outcomes, including tumor heterogeneity, gut microbiota composition, and genomic and epigenetic modifications, are also examined. Furthermore, the molecular mechanisms underlying immune evasion and therapeutic resistance are analyzed, with a focus on the contributions of noncoding RNAs and epigenetic alterations, along with innovative intervention strategies. This review emphasizes recent preclinical and clinical advancements, with particular attention to biomarker-driven approaches aimed at optimizing patient prognosis. Challenges such as immunotherapy-related toxicity, limited efficacy in solid tumors, and production constraints are highlighted as critical areas for future research. Advancements in personalized therapies and novel delivery systems are proposed as avenues to enhance treatment effectiveness and accessibility. By incorporating insights from multiple disciplines, this review aims to deepen the understanding and application of cancer immunotherapy, ultimately fostering more effective and widely accessible therapeutic solutions.",Nabavi N,Independent Researcher,phcgs@nus.edu.sg.

Web-based decision aids (WDAs) are interactive tools that help patients make informed decisions by meeting their needs both inside and outside the hospital, providing real-time decision assistance, and being more practical and convenient. Although the incidence of breast cancer ranks first among female cancers in China, studies focusing specifically on the use of WDAs in breast cancer patients have not been conducted in the country. The objective of this study was to determine the effects of WDAs on breast cancer patients considering a breast reconstruction. A total of 70 patients with breast cancer were randomized, with 63 completing the whole trial. The control group used paper-based decision aids, which they could use freely in the ward to obtain health information support. The intervention group used web-based decision aids, including decision assessment, decision support, and decision evaluation, which they could use anytime and anywhere on their mobile phones. The study measured decision conflict, preferred decision-making roles, unmet needs, and decision satisfaction at baseline and before and after the intervention. No differences were found in the demographic and clinical features between the two groups. Compared with the control group, the intervention group had lower scores for the dimensions of decision support and decision effectiveness, decision uncertainty, total score of decision conflict and information needs, work and financial needs, access and continuity of care, coping, sharing and emotional needs, and total score of unmet information needs (P all < 0.05). Patients in the intervention group had a higher proportion of active and collaborative roles, higher scores in the information, deliberation, decision, and global satisfaction and confidence dimensions, and a higher total score for decision satisfaction (P all < 0.05). WDAs are a convenient tool for promoting collaborative decision making, satisfying information needs, reducing decision conflict, and improving decision satisfaction. In addition, the development of WDAs avoids the limitations of region and time, and provides sufficient knowledge for patients to improve their medical experience.

However, their performance in Spanish-language medical contexts remains underexplored. This study evaluates the effectiveness of single-agent and multi-agent strategies in answering questions from the EUNACOM, a standardized medical licensure exam in Chile, across 21 medical specialties. GPT-4o was tested on 1,062 multiple-choice questions from publicly available EUNACOM preparation materials. Single-agent strategies included Zero-Shot, Few-Shot, Chain-of-Thought (CoT), Self-Reflection, and MED-PROMPT, while multi-agent strategies involved Voting, Weighted Voting, Borda Count, MEDAGENTS, and MDAGENTS. Each strategy was tested under three temperature settings (0.3, 0.6, 1.2). Performance was assessed by accuracy, and statistical analyses, including Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney U tests, were performed. Computational resource utilization, such as API calls and execution time, was also analyzed. MDAGENTS achieved the highest accuracy with a mean score of 89.97% (SD = 0.56%), outperforming all other strategies (p < 0.001). MEDAGENTS followed with a mean score of 87.99% (SD = 0.49%), and the CoT with Few-Shot strategy scored 87.67% (SD = 0.12%). Temperature settings did not significantly affect performance (F2,54 = 1.45, p = 0.24). Specialty-level analysis showed the highest accuracies in Psychiatry (95.51%), Neurology (95.49%), and Surgery (95.38%), while lower accuracies were observed in Neonatology (77.54%), Otolaryngology (76.64%), and Urology/Nephrology (76.59%). Notably, several exam questions were correctly answered using simpler single-agent strategies without employing complex reasoning or collaboration frameworks. Multi-agent strategies, particularly MDAGENTS, significantly enhance GPT-4o's performance on Spanish-language medical exams, leveraging collaboration to improve diagnostic accuracy. However, simpler single-agent strategies are sufficient to address many questions, high-lighting that only a fraction of standardized medical exams require sophisticated reasoning or multi-agent interaction. These findings suggest potential for LLMs as efficient and scalable tools in Spanish-speaking healthcare, though computational optimization remains a key area for future research.",,,falterma@uc.cl.

Individuals with these disabilities encounter various challenges including limited educational opportunities, restricted access to academic resources, and delays or shortages of support services. This study aimed to provide data for improving the health and well-being of individuals with visual or hearing impairments by analyzing health education interventions using classification criteria of the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF). The scoping review followed Arksey and O'Malley's methodology and adhered to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews guidelines, organizing research questions by population, concepts, and contexts. Data included studies on health education interventions for individuals with visual or hearing impairments, sourced from Cochrane, Ovid MEDLINE, and Google Scholar. A specific search strategy with relevant keywords was used. The selection focused on intervention studies evaluating the effects of the intervention for these individuals globally. Two researchers independently reviewed full-text articles and extracted data into a standardized table, with results summarized using descriptive statistics. The literature search identified 3,168 articles, 34 of which were selected for analysis (19 concerned individuals with visual impairments, while 15 studies concerned individuals with hearing impairments). Health education interventions for the visually impaired mainly focused on skill acquisition and development, primarily delivered through face-to-face sessions. Healthcare providers predominantly facilitated these interventions within healthcare institutions. Similarly, health education interventions for the hearing impaired primarily focused on acquisition and development, mainly through face-to-face interactions. The dropout rate in the interventions ranged from 0% to approximately 50%. Outcome variables included physical function, psychosocial factors, behavior-related variables, and knowledge-related variables derived from the ICF in both cohorts. This scoping review presented an examination of tailored health education interventions for individuals with visual or hearing impairments. Delivered largely through face-to-face sessions by healthcare providers, these interventions focused on skill acquisition and development, addressing physical function, psychosocial factors, behavior-related changes, and knowledge improvements. The wide range of dropout rates revealed barriers such as accessibility and sustainability.

To address this, we performed a comparative analysis of two guidelines for pediatric HTN: the 2017 American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) and the 2016 European Society for Hypertension (ESH), applying the Korean blood pressure (BP) reference specifically to the Korean pediatric population. Data from 2,060 children and adolescents aged 10-18 years from the Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (2016-2018) were analyzed. BP was classified according to the AAP, the ESH, and the Korea Regional BP Classification (KRC). High BP was defined as BP exceeding the normotensive range. The prevalence of high BP in Korean youth was significantly higher according to the AAP group than that in the ESH group (19.5% vs. 10.6%, P < 0.0001). Variations in prevalence were noted based on age, sex, and obesity. No significant differences were observed between the AAP and KRC groups in terms of high BP prevalence. The application of the AAP and KRC provided a more comprehensive reflection of CVD risk factors, including obesity and metabolic profiles, compared to the ESH. The KRC showed a tendency to classify more non-obese individuals as having elevated BP, although this difference was not statistically significant. In comparing the AAP, ESH, and KRC criteria in the Korean pediatric population, the KRC demonstrated a tendency to identify individuals with CVD risk factors as having high BP. This finding suggests that using the KRC as the criterion for high BP may facilitate earlier intervention in the management of CVD risk.",,,dvm.spark@gmail.com.

However, the integration of specialized palliative support within acute stroke services remains uncommon in many developing countries. This study highlights the emerging challenges faced by patients with ischemic stroke aged ≥ 80 years treated with reperfusion therapies, identifies early palliative care needs, and underscores the importance of comprehensive support in the acute setting. We selected consecutive patients with ischemic stroke aged ≥ 80 years who received reperfusion therapies (intravenous thrombolysis or mechanical thrombectomy) at the time of stroke unit admission. Clinical and demographic data were prospectively collected and analyzed. A total of 52 patients aged ≥ 80 years received reperfusion therapies. The in-hospital mortality rate was 5/52 (9.6%). Key challenges identified during hospitalization included dysphagia in 32 patients (61.5%), dyspnea in 7 patients (13.5%), delirium in 14 patients (26.9%), and mobility impairment and/or speech disturbance in 22 patients (42.3%). Despite the increasing use of reperfusion therapies in patients aged ≥ 80 years, symptoms requiring comprehensive support and early palliative interventions persist in the acute stroke setting. Our findings emphasize the need for early palliative assessments to address stroke-related symptoms such as dysphagia, delirium, and mobility or speech disturbances, ultimately enhancing patient comfort.

A cross-sectional descriptive design following STROBE guidelines examined the relationship between green human resource practices and organizational environmental performance among nurses. Staff nurses employed in all inpatient medical, surgical, and critical care units at Alexandria Main University Hospital (n = 745) comprised the participants, representing all target demographics. The nurses filled out the Organizational Environmental Performance Scale and the Green Human Resources Practices Questionnaire. Age, gender, education, and nursing experience were among the demographic details gathered. The data collection period was three months, from February 1st, 2023, to May 1st, 2023. Every query from the nurses was addressed, and justifications were provided. The data was analyzed using statistical techniques such as stepwise regression, ANOVA, t-tests, and Pearson correlation. 60.7% of the studied nurses perceived low Green Human Resources Practices (63.27 ± 8.14). Furthermore, the majority of the nurses who participated in the study (90.1%) believe that environmental performance is at a moderate level, with a mean score of 73.86 ± 15.54. According to linear regression, the Green Human Resources Practices of the nurses under study can account for about 17.5% of the explained variance of their perceived environmental performance; this is a significant model (F = 157.939 & p < 0.001). The study highlights the importance of the perceived adoption of Green Human Resources Practices in supporting environmental performance. Addressing demographic factors and fostering a supportive work environment is crucial for optimizing organizational environmental performance. Insights from this study can enlighten battered interventions and policy pronouncements to augment nursing practice, organizational growth, and healthcare outcomes in Egypt. Green HR practices have consequences for nursing, such as enabling nurses to spearhead sustainability projects, encouraging environmentally friendly patient care techniques, and raising employee involvement through incentives and training. Nurses can make a substantial contribution to better environmental performance in healthcare settings by incorporating these practices. In the end, this promotes a sustainable culture that is advantageous to patients and the environment. Not applicable.",,,aml.diab@alexu.edu.eg.

We tested an intervention that provides first-trimester medication abortion at primary health centers, using telemedicine to connect nurses/midwives to doctors in district hospitals for authorization of services. We implemented a 15-month prospective study to assess the feasibility, effectiveness, safety, and client acceptability of a hybrid telemedicine model. In the model tested, doctors provided clinical guidance by reviewing client data and lab results, and authorized the procedure via telemedicine, while the nurses/midwives consulted with the client, provided medication at the health center, and conducted follow-up over the phone or in person. Service data record forms were completed using the REDCap online platform and client exit interviews were conducted after completion of the abortion. During implementation, 242 clients received medication abortion at the health centers, with 50% of clients interviewed during client exit interviews. The protocol ensured high adherence rates; 96% completed abortion. Post-procedure complications were rare (3%) and were largely managed at health centers with remote support from a medical doctor. Vaginal bleeding (36%) and abdominal pain (41%) were the prevalent side effects experienced by clients; only 10% of clients who reported side effects needed to see a provider for management. Overall client satisfaction with services was very high (98%) and the perceived quality of services was also very high (97-99%). We conclude that this hybrid telemedicine model for the provision of first-trimester medication abortion is feasible, effective, safe and accepted by clients. Results from this study will enable revisions to the abortion clinical guidelines to include task-sharing with mid-level providers, such as nurses and midwives, via telemedicine in health centers.",Dushimeyesu E; Kanyamanza E; Ngoga E,Rwanda Society of Obstetricians and Gynecologists; Rwanda Health Initiative for Youth and Women,ndola@berkeley.edu.

Integrating the health and social service sectors has been proposed as a preferred solution to support healthy ageing, yet implementation in real settings remains challenging. Using an implementation science framework, this protocol outlines a Type-2 hybrid effectiveness-implementation design to adopt localized strategies for a Community-Based Health-Social Partnership Programme (C-HSPP) and test its effectiveness in enhancing self-care management among older adults in the community. This study has two primary foci: to evaluate both the effectiveness and the implementation outcomes of C-HSPP in a non-governmental organization that operates seven community elderly centres across Hong Kong. A cluster randomized controlled trial (CRCT) with a two-arm, matched-pair, pragmatic design has been adopted to evaluate the programme's effectiveness. Regarding implementation outcomes, the reach, adoption, implementation, and maintenance of the programme will be examined using multiple data sources with quantitative and qualitative data. The trial will include 732 older adults aged 60 or above from four matched pairs of community centres, with each paired centre randomly assigned to either the 12-week C-HSPP intervention or to the usual community services. The C-HSPP intervention features a comprehensive assessment-intervention-evaluation framework using the Omaha System with health-social case management. Data will be collected at three time-points: baseline, post-intervention, and three months post-intervention, with self-efficacy as the primary outcome and other health indicators as secondary outcomes. An effectiveness analysis will be conducted using mixed-effects models and generalized estimating equations, incorporating degrees-of-freedom corrections and adjustments for clustering. Regarding the implementation outcome analysis, quantitative data including service statistics and a satisfaction survey will be presented using descriptive analysis. Qualitative data involving interview transcripts will be analysed using directed content analysis. By simultaneously evaluating both clinical effectiveness and implementation outcomes, this study will validate the evidence-based intervention and identify facilitators and barriers in the implementation process. The findings will support the adoption of an effective evidence-based programme in real-world settings, provide insights on the implementation process to ensure its sustainability, and furnish evidence for policymakers to adopt an integrated health-social partnership programme in the community.

Novel all oral treatment regimens containing new antibiotics with reduced treatment duration are available. World Health Organization guidelines recommend the use of shorter all-oral regimens under operational research. To guide recommendations, we will compare two all-oral, short (≤ 11 months) regimens for the outcomes of efficacy, safety, cost, and health-related quality of life under programmatic conditions in Pakistan. This is a stepped wedge, cluster randomized controlled trial with economic evaluation and health related quality of life sub-studies. Modified all-oral 9-month regimen will be sequentially rolled-out compared with the standard all-oral 11-month regimen at 12 sites in Punjab, Islamabad and Azad Jammu and Kashmir region, Pakistan. A total of 400 eligible participants will be enrolled in both study arms. The primary outcome is difference in efficacy as measured by the proportion of patients with treatment success without recurrence at 12 months after the end of treatment between regimens using a non-inferiority design with a margin of 12%. The intention to treat analysis principle will be employed and a marginal mean model with Poisson generalized estimation equations, and a log-link will be used to assess the relative risk. The economic evaluation will be carried out from the healthcare providers perspective; linear mixed models will be used to estimate differences in costs between arms. Health related quality of life will be measured with the EQ-5D-3L quality of life questionnaire at four time points during the study period. The impact will be assessed by calculating the changes for each participant between time points.

A clinical pathway was devised with five key interventions designed to enhance supportive care, increase communication among providers, and quantify nurse navigator accountability. Patients with solid tumors treated with concurrent chemotherapy and radiation with curative intent were eligible for the study. They were identified in the multidisciplinary clinics of the Helen F. Graham Cancer Center of the Christian Care Health System (HFGCCRI). A total of 318 consecutive pathway patients were analyzed and compared to 455 historical controls. Pathway patients were selected from the beginning of the program in 2016 until 2019 and followed from the onset of radiotherapy until 1 month after the completion of radiotherapy. Emergency room (ED) visits and inpatient admissions were the primary outcomes of the study. The independent variables-including age, performance status, sex, race, insurance status, and diagnosis-were analyzed using regression-based adjustment for covariates. The expected number of ED visits during the study period was 46% lower for SCOOP patients than for controls. Likewise, the expected number of hospitalizations was 50% lower for SCOOP patients. Both were statistically significant. Reanalysis after propensity score matching yielded similar results. Pathway interventions specifically selected for our institution appeared to curtail ED visits and admissions in patients treated with exacting treatment regimens.",Koprowski C; Scott M,; Supportive and Palliative Care Department,koprowskicd@gmail.com.

Sixteen patients with complex tibial plateau fractures were randomly divided into FEP and Trad groups, with eight patients in each group. The FEP group underwent preoperative finite element analysis for personalized surgical planning and dual-plate fixation; the Trad group participated in traditional preoperative discussions and underwent a multi-plate fixation. Perioperative and postoperative indicators were collected from both groups, and the stress distribution and displacement under different internal fixation modes were evaluated using finite element analysis. Additionally, a cost-effectiveness analysis was conducted to compare the total costs of internal fixation and hospitalization. The surgical times were significantly shorter in the FEP group than in the Trad group (170.00 ± 59.52 vs. 240.00 ± 59.04 min, p = 0.033), and patients in the Trad group had shorter times to ambulation (12.88 ± 0.99 vs. 14.25 ± 1.49 days, p = 0.047). There were no significant differences between the groups in terms of postoperative orthopaedic scores, mobility indices, fracture healing times, or radiological indicators. Biomechanical analysis revealed that the multiplate fixation mode provided a more uniform stress distribution, but this difference was not statistically significant. In the FEP group, the total costs of internal fixation (4772.25 ± 217.31 vs. 8991.88 ± 2811.25 yuan, p = 0.004) and hospitalization (34796.75 ± 9749.19 vs. 65405.14 ± 28684.80 yuan, p = 0.013) were significantly lower. While ensuring clinical effectiveness, FEP demonstrated greater cost-effectiveness by shortening the surgery time and reducing internal fixation costs. Although the multiplate fixation mode was biomechanically superior to the dual-plate mode, it did not result in significant clinical advantages and was more costly. FEP improves the economic efficiency of treatment for complex tibial plateau fractures in middle-aged and elderly patients and is recommended. This study has certain limitations, such as a small sample size and a short follow-up period. Thus, larger-scale studies with longer-term follow-up data are needed to further validate these findings and explore whether all patient populations can benefit from these practices or if the benefits are limited to specific groups, such as elderly patients or those with certain types of fractures.",,,1010968798@qq.com.

The first incorporates multiple predictors including age, sex, deprivation, smoking, alcohol, family history, medical diagnoses and symptoms (both general and cancer-specific symptoms). The second additionally includes commonly used blood tests (full blood count and liver function tests). We use multinomial logistic regression to develop separate equations in men and women to predict the absolute probability of 15 cancer types using a population of 7.46 million adults aged 18 to 84 years in England. We evaluate performance in two separate validation cohorts (total 2.64 million patients in England and 2.74 million from Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland). The models have improved performance compared with existing models with improved discrimination, calibration, sensitivity and net benefit. These algorithms provide superior prediction estimates in the UK compared with existing scores and could lead to better clinical decision-making and potentially earlier diagnosis of cancer.",,,julia.hippisley-cox@qmul.ac.uk.

Chronic conditions increasingly strain health systems, which are often unprepared for these demands. This study examines the burden of conditions requiring acute versus chronic care, including sequelae. Conditions and sequelae from the Global Burden of Diseases Study 2019 were classified into acute or chronic care categories. Data were analysed by age, sex, and socio-demographic index, presenting total numbers and contributions to burden metrics such as Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs), Years Lived with Disability (YLD), and Years of Life Lost (YLL). Approximately 68% of DALYs were attributed to chronic care, while 27% were due to acute care. Chronic care needs increased with age, representing 86% of YLDs and 71% of YLLs, and accounting for 93% of YLDs from sequelae. These findings highlight that chronic care needs far exceed acute care needs globally, necessitating health systems to adapt accordingly.",,,

This double-center retrospective observational study was conducted at Tokyo Bay Urayasu Ichikawa Medical Center and Keio University Hospital from January 2012 to October 2022. Efficacy was determined via clinical evaluation (mortality rate, recurrence rate, vital changes) and bacteriological evaluation, and the optimal fT ≥ MIC was calculated via receiver operating characteristic curve analysis. As a result, the number of patients evaluated were 40 (35 and 5 in the treatment success and treatment failure groups, respectively). Univariate analysis showed that fT ≥ MIC, recurrence rate, and MIC for cefmetazole against bacteria were significantly different for the two groups (p < 0.05). Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis showed that the optimal fT ≥ MIC indicating efficacy was 57% (area under the curve: 0.94, 95% confidence interval: 0.86-1.00, p = 0.002). All patients with fT ≥ MIC ≥ 57% had successful treatment, whereas the frequency of treatment failure was high among those with fT ≥ MIC <57%. The optimal fT ≥ MIC for the clinical efficacy of de-escalation to cefmetazole in patients with bacteremic urinary tract infection by extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing E. coli was fT ≥ MIC ≥ 57%. This finding would be useful for optimal dosing of cefmetazole.",,,

Malawi is just starting to implement simulation-based education, even though it is recommended in midwifery education to enhance patient safety. Therefore, to ensure successful incorporation of simulation-based education into midwifery training programs, it is crucial to understand students' experiences with the pedagogic method. The study applied a descriptive-mixed-convergent design. One-hundred and seven midwifery students participated in the study. Data were collected through questionnaires and three focus group discussions. Quantitative and qualitative data were analysed using descriptive statistics and content analysis respectively. Quantitatively, students graded all the questions related to the simulation design elements, educational practices and students' satisfaction and self-confidence in learning with mean scores above four on a 5-point Likert Scale. One theme and two sub-themes emerged from qualitative data analysis. Main theme: simulation mirrors demanded competence for professional practice; sub-themes: (1) a realistic and active learning method; and (2) a conducive environment for students' learning. Midwifery students experienced simulation as a valued pedagogical approach to teaching and learning that mirrored postpartum management clinical skills necessary for them to practice as professionals in the resource-limited setting. More research is necessary to explore feasibility for simulation-based education in Malawi and whether students can apply the knowledge and skills acquired during simulation into clinical practice particularly within constrained environment.",,,ckabondo@kuhes.ac.mw.

Several factors may lead to a day-to-day variation in the measurement of viral genetic material. Wastewater samples are systematically collected from the two major wastewater treatment plants in Crete, Greece. Physico-chemical factors were tested, viral concentration was determined by RT-real time PCR and the results were normalized. The influence of restriction measures, rain and physico-chemical agents was addressed. Statistics together with machine learning (ML) were applied to predict human cases. 781 samples were analyzed. RNA concentration was reduced during lockdown and was impacted by rain. Fluctuations in pH and total solids' concentrations were associated with changes in viral load. Conductivity was mainly related to chloride ions. In Heraklion, wastewater viral load preceded human cases by three days on average. Cross- correlation estimates did not perform likewise in Chania. According to ML, the ratio of sewage RNA measurements to reported cases decreased in comparison to the first wave, due to different variants, climatological parameters, testing rate and behaviors related to seeking healthcare. The model developed showed a close approximation between recorded and predicted cases. Parameters such as total solids, pH, conductivity, rain and inhibitors can significantly impact the recovery of viral RNA. The correlation between viral load in wastewater and human cases is not straightforward. The application of ML may fill some but not every gap. Existing models cannot be directly applied to different Wastewater Treatment Plants or countries.",Koutsolioutsou A; Kotsifaki C; Kalisperi D; Dolapsakis E; Sifakaki K,Wastewater Treatment Plant of Chania; Department of Environmental Health and Monitoring of Smoking Secession; Wastewater Treatment Plant of Heraklion,surreydimos@hotmail.com.

In this article, we report the associations of tumor mutational burden (TMB) with outcomes of D with or without T in combination with CT versus CT alone. A total of 1013 patients with EGFR/ALK wild-type mNSCLC were randomized (1 : 1 : 1) to T + D + CT, D + CT, or CT, stratified by programmed cell death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) tumor cell (TC) expression ≥50% versus <50%, disease stage (IVA versus IVB) and histology (squamous versus nonsquamous). Patient subgroups were defined by a range of blood TMB (bTMB) values, including at a prespecified cut-off of 20 mutations (mut)/megabase (Mb) and across further subdivisions by PD-L1 TC expression ≥1% or <1% and by tissue TMB (tTMB) values. At the primary OS data cut-off (12 March 2021), at each bTMB or tTMB cut-off, the magnitude of OS benefit appeared greater among patients in the bTMB- or tTMB-high subgroups for the T + D + CT arm versus the CT arm but was similar between subgroups for the D + CT arm versus the CT arm. Updated OS analyses in the bTMB ≥20 and <20 mut/Mb subgroups, after median follow-up of >5 years (data cut-off 24 August 2023), were similar to those obtained at the primary OS data cut-off. First-line treatment with T (limited course) plus D (until progression) and four cycles of CT consistently improved clinical outcomes versus CT alone in both bTMB-high and -low subgroups, and also in both high and low tTMB subgroups, in patients with mNSCLC. Benefit appeared greater in the TMB-high versus TMB-low subgroups; the addition of anti-cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen-4 to anti-PD-L1 and CT seemed to increase the magnitude of this difference.",Oliner KS; L'Hernault A; Ratcliffe M; Madison H; Lai Z; Stewart R; Mann H; Lowery C,AstraZeneca,Solange.Peters@chuv.ch.

This biomarker study evaluated the association of GWMS with clinical outcomes in mCRC patients who were enrolled in a randomized phase II DEEPER trial of comparing modified (m)-FOLFOXIRI plus bevacizumab (Bev) and m-FOLFOXIRI plus cetuximab (Cet) as first-line treatment. GWMS was measured using tumor tissues which were collected from patients with tissue samples available in the DEEPER trial. In addition, tumor tissues were classified into high-methylated colorectal cancer (HMCC) and low-methylated colorectal cancer (LMCC) groups. The correlation between GWMS and survival was analyzed by comparing progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) between the two different groups of GWMS. Of the 137 patients, 15 were classified into the HMCC group, and 122 were classified into the LMCC group; 71 patients were treated with Bev, and 66 were treated with Cet. In the Bev arm, OS was significantly shorter in the HMCC group than in the LMCC group (median 24.2 versus 48.9 months, P = 0.03). In the Cet arm, both PFS and OS were significantly shorter in the HMCC group than in the LMCC group (median 4.0 versus 14.3 months, P < 0.01 and median 13.6 versus 42.7 months, P < 0.01). The interaction tests revealed that GWMS was a significant predictor of PFS and OS in the Cet arm. GWMS was associated with survival in RAS wild-type mCRC patients treated with initial chemotherapy. Also, it may serve as a predictor for selection of molecular-targeted antibodies in first-line treatment.",Fujii M,Japan Clinical Cancer Research Organization,y.suna0825@gmail.com.

40334297,Real-time brain tumour diagnoses using a novel lightweight deep learning model.,,Computers in biology and medicine,10.1016/j.compbiomed.2025.110242,"Brain tumours continue to be a primary cause of worldwide death, highlighting the critical need for effective and accurate diagnostic tools. This article presents MK-YOLOv8, an innovative lightweight deep learning framework developed for the real-time detection and categorization of brain tumours from MRI images. Based on the YOLOv8 architecture, the proposed model incorporates Ghost Convolution, the C3Ghost module, and the SPPELAN module to improve feature extraction and substantially decrease computational complexity. An x-small object detection layer has been added, supporting precise detection of small and x-small tumours, which is crucial for early diagnosis. Trained on the Figshare Brain Tumour (FBT) dataset comprising (3,064) MRI images, MK-YOLOv8 achieved a mean Average Precision (mAP) of 99.1% at IoU (0.50) and 88.4% at IoU (0.50-0.95), outperforming YOLOv8 (98% and 78.8%, respectively). Glioma recall improved by 26%, underscoring the enhanced sensitivity to challenging tumour types. With a computational footprint of only 96.9 GFLOPs (representing 37.5% of YOYOLOv8x'sFLOPs) and utilizing 12.6 million parameters, a mere 18.5% of YOYOLOv8's parameters, MK-YOLOv8 delivers high efficiency with reduced resource demands. Also, it trained on the Br35H dataset (801 images) to guarantee the model's robustness and generalization; it achieved a mAP of 98.6% at IoU (0.50). The suggested model operates at 62 frames per second (FPS) and is suited for real-time clinical processes. These developments establish MK-YOLOv8 as an innovative framework, overcoming challenges in tiny tumour identification and providing a generalizable, adaptable, and precise detection approach for brain tumour diagnostics in clinical settings.",,,mo.alnageeb@gmail.com.
40334283,Improving Access to and Delivery of Maternal Health Care Services to Prevent Postpartum Hemorrhage in Selected States in Nigeria: Human-Centered Design Study.,2025-05-08,JMIR human factors,10.2196/58577,"A significant cause of postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) is access to and delivery of maternal health care services. Several multisectoral strategies have been deployed to address the challenges with little success, thereby necessitating the use of human-centered design (HCD) to enhance health care delivery, particularly in PPH management. This study aims to develop facility-level solutions for optimizing uterotonic supply chain systems and health service delivery in PPH management through an HCD approach in selected Nigerian states. The research used a four-phase HCD methodology: (1) co-research, (2) co-design, (3) co-refinement, and (4) implementation. However, this paper focused on the first 3 phases. In the co-research phase, 203 interviews were conducted, involving 80 pregnant women and nursing mothers, 97 health care workers, and 26 key stakeholders. Additionally, 33 sites were observed across a 3-level continuum of care. Interviews and focus group discussions revealed insights into the distribution of health workers and observed PPH cases, alongside knowledge and administration of uterotonics. Data analysis was carried out using three key steps: (1) identifying key themes from the collected data, (2) developing insight statements that encapsulate these themes, and (3) translating each insight statement into actionable design opportunities. About 150 ideas were produced and translated into 12 solution prototypes in the co-design phase. Progressive refinement following feedback from 140 stakeholders led to the selection of three final solutions: (1) implementing a referral linkage system to improve the transportation of pregnant women to nearby health facilities, (2) increasing demand for antenatal care services among pregnant women and their families, and (3) delivering a comprehensive uterotonic logistics management program for streamlined uterotonic storage and management. This approach aligns with global health trends advocating for HCD integration in health care programming and aims to empower local champions to drive sustainable improvements in maternal health outcomes. Judicious implementation of the developed prototypes across the states can strengthen clinical care and potentially reduce maternal health service delivery gaps.",Tijani B; Igbokwe U; Filani T; Adewemimo A; Ameyan L; Iyekekpolor M; Karera S; Oluyide O; Ezike E; Akinreni T; Ogefere O; Adetimilehin V; Amasiatu V; Nwaokorie C; Kangkum N; Fasawe O; Aigbogun E,Co-creation Hub Nigeria; Solina Centre for International Development and Research; Clinton Health Access Initiative,
40334266,"Barriers to and Facilitators of Implementing Overnight Nursing Teleconsultation in Small, Rural Long-Term Care Facilities: Qualitative Interview Study.",2025-05-08,JMIR aging,10.2196/71950,"Teleconsultation has expanded rapidly in recent years, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic, and has become standard practice among physicians. The benefits of teleconsultation, namely, improving access to care, ensuring continuity and quality of care, increasing patient satisfaction, and reducing costs and wait times, are well documented. However, its use in nursing practice, especially in long-term care settings, remains underresearched despite its significant transformative potential, particularly in resource-limited and rural settings, where it could address major challenges such as nursing shortages and access to care. This study aimed to identify barriers to and facilitators of implementing overnight nursing teleconsultation in rural residential and long-term care centers in Quebec, Canada (centres d'hébergement et de soins de longue durée [CHSLDs]), with ≤50 beds. A 6-month pilot project was rolled out sequentially in 3 rural CHSLDs in 2 administrative regions of Quebec between July 2022 and March 2023. A total of 38 semistructured interviews were conducted with managers (n=27, 71%), nursing staff members (n=9, 24%), and resident committee presidents (n=2, 5%) between February 2023 and July 2023. The study identified several barriers to the implementation of teleconsultation. The main barriers reported included union opposition (managers: 23/27, 85%), network instability (resident committee presidents: 2/2, 100%), limited technology skills (nursing staff members: 7/9, 78%), a perceived increase in workload (nursing staff members: 8/9, 89%; resident committee presidents: 2/2, 100%), and a low volume of teleconsultations (nursing staff members: 8/9, 89%). Despite the barriers, participants also identified key facilitators. These included the care setting (nursing staff members: 9/9, 100%; managers: 21/27, 78%), buy-in from senior management and managers (managers: 27/27, 100%; resident committee presidents: 2/2, 100%), collaboration between the departments (nursing staff members: 9/9, 100%), nursing staff motivation (nursing staff members: 9/9, 100%), and improvements in professional practices (nursing staff members: 8/9, 89%). Finally, the relative benefits of teleconsultation, such as enhanced mutual vision, faster assessment of clinical situations, improved resident care management quality, and greater flexibility and safety, were unanimously recognized (38/38, 100%) as contributing to its acceptability and potential for success. This study provides an in-depth understanding of the barriers to and facilitators of implementing overnight nursing teleconsultation in small rural CHSLDs. This constitutes a sound basis for developing tailored strategies aimed at overcoming identified barriers and optimizing facilitators. The results also provide practical guidelines for decision makers, highlighting the need to adapt implementation approaches to the unique context of each facility. Furthermore, this study highlights the importance of further research to broaden our knowledge on the dissemination and scale-up of health care innovations. This includes the development of learning health systems capable of responding in an agile and effective way to the needs of rural and vulnerable populations both in Quebec and elsewhere.",Nabelsi V; Plouffe V; Leclerc MC,Département des sciences comptables; Département des sciences infirmières; Département des sciences administratives,
40334225,Quality assessment of medicinal material Daqingye and Banlangen from Isatis tinctoria Fort. reveals widespread substitution with Strobilanthes species.,2025-05-07,PloS one,10.1371/journal.pone.0323084,"Isatidis Folium (Daqingye, DQY) and Isatidis Radix (Banlangen, BLG) are the leaf and root of the plant Isatis tinctoria Fort. (syn. Isatis indigotica Fort.), commonly prescribed for detoxification, and the inhibition of viral and oxidative activities. Given their widespread use, we set forth to investigate the authenticity and chemical composition of DQY and BLG samples obtained from eighteen administrative districts in the Hong Kong market. The present study screened the identities and chemical composition of DQY and BLG through molecular authentication and HPLC methods, respectively. Molecular authentication utilized DNA barcoding, focusing on nuclear ribosomal and chloroplast regions. The HPLC methods were conducted in accordance with the Hong Kong Chinese Materia Medica Standards (HKCMMS). We found that only one sample was genuine according to the species definition in the Chinese Pharmacopoeia and HKCMMS for both herbs. The chemical composition of the adulterated and the genuine samples were completely different, that the adulterant samples did not have the standard chemical markers epigoitrin and indirubin of Banlangen and Daqingye as listed in the Chinese Pharmacopoeia. Our investigation underscores the widespread substitution by Strobilanthes (Nanbanlangen and Nandaqingye) species, mainly due to the preference of use of this herb in southern China. The adulteration of Daqingye by Blumea balsamifera (Ainaxiang) was probably due to mislabeling in the herb shop, though the error might have originated from the supplying sources. We recommend providing education on the necessity of using authentic Daqingye and Banlangen, especially in combined regimens, to standardize treatment effects. More education is also needed on the morphological differentiation of Banlangen from Nanbanlangen and Daqingye from Nandaqingye. The implementation of a track-and-trace system is strongly recommended to prevent and deter incorrect supply chain practices that lead to substitution or adulteration.",,,

These barriers contribute to reduced healthcare-seeking behaviour, poorer access to health information, and adverse health outcomes. In response, a multidisciplinary working group of patients, clinicians, researchers, and charity representatives was established to investigate accessibility, communication, and deaf awareness within the United Kingdom's (UK) National Health Service (NHS). A cross-sectional survey was conducted to explore the communication and accessibility experiences of PDHL NHS patients, and their perceived impact on well-being. The survey used rating scales and open-ended questions and data were analysed using descriptive statistics and thematic analysis. The survey was made available in British Sign Language (BSL). The online survey was completed by 556 PDHL, including 50 parents, carers, or family members who had accompanied PDHL friends or relatives to NHS appointments. All respondents had used NHS services within the last 24 months, with 10% identifying BSL as their preferred language. Qualitative analysis of the open-ended responses generated three key themes: 1) Accessibility challenges, 2) Impact of communication difficulties across the service pathway, and 3) Lack of consistent, effective deaf-aware communication. Overall, 64.4% of PDHL NHS patients reported missing 50% or more of the important information provided during their NHS appointments, and 32% were satisfied with the communication skills of healthcare staff. This study presents the largest UK-wide dataset of its kind, and findings highlight the widespread non-compliance with the legally mandated Accessible Information Standards (AIS) within NHS services.

Using data from the GBD study, we examined trends in CVD burden linked to low physical activity, including mortality counts, disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), age-standardized mortality rates (ASMR), and age-standardized disability rates (ASDR). Decomposition analysis was used to identify key drivers of these changes, and frontier analysis visualized each country's potential to reduce the burden. An autoregressive integrated moving average model was used to forecast the burden from 2022 to 2036. In 2021, approximately 370,000 deaths globally were attributed to CVD due to low physical activity. The ASMR and ASDR for CVD were 4.53 per 100,000 (95% uncertainty interval: 1.52 to 8.05) and 85.95 (95% UI: 35.25 to 140.65), respectively. From 1990 to 2021, the global burden increased, particularly in regions with a middle socio-demographic index, driven by aging populations and population growth. The ASMR is projected to decrease to 3.49 per 100,000 by 2036. Low physical activity is a major contributor to CVD-related mortality and disability worldwide. Public health interventions aimed at increasing physical activity, especially in regions with rising burdens, are essential to reduce the global CVD burden.",,,

Here, we compared the effectiveness of CMT and usual care for treating myofascial TMD. A 26-week randomized controlled trial was conducted from 2018 to 2019 with 80 patients across five hospitals in Korea who were diagnosed with myofascial TMD and had temporomandibular joint (TMJ) pain lasting more than three months. Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to either the CMT group, which underwent eight sessions of CMT over four weeks, or the usual care (UC) group, which received physical therapy for the same period. Treatment effectiveness was evaluated in terms of pain, function, and quality of life over 26 weeks. For determining cost-effectiveness, quality-adjusted life years (QALY) were analyzed, and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios from the societal and healthcare system perspectives were calculated. At week 5, the visual analog scale (VAS) scores decreased more in the CMT group than in the control group, although the difference was statistically insignificant. The CMT group showed significant improvement in specific functional and quality of life measures, particularly in the EuroQoL-VAS (-13.21 (95% confidence interval [CI] -20.03 to -6.38) and the Jaw Functional Limitation Scale-Global score of 0.59 (95% CI 0.13 to 1.05), through improvements were not consistent across all indices. The CMT group showed a slightly higher QALY, and the 26-week incremental cost in the CMT group was $338 lower than that of the usual care group. The cost of CMT was $150 higher than that of usual care, and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio per utility ranged from $4,011 to $17,851. When a ""willingness to pay for treatment ($26,375)"" threshold was applied, the probability of CMT being cost-effective was 68.1%-98.3%. Despite no significant differences in pain reduction at week 5, CMT was found to be a cost-effective treatment for TMD, particularly for improving function and quality of life. These findings may serve as a basis for considering the expansion of national health insurance coverage for Chuna therapy in Korea.

The use of reporting guidelines and the registration of clinical trials enhance the reliability and credibility of research findings by promoting transparency and minimizing potential biases. However, it remains uncertain to what extent leading immunology and allergy journals have embraced these tools. This study aims to evaluate how commonly reporting guidelines and clinical trial registration are required and endorsed within leading immunology and allergy journals. We identified the top 100 journals in the subcategory of ""Immunology and Allergy"" using the Scopus CiteScore tool for the year 2021. We thoroughly reviewed the ""Instructions for Authors"" section of each journal, focusing on indications related to specific reporting guidelines as outlined by the Enhancing the Quality and Transparency of Health Research (EQUATOR) Network, as well as the practice of clinical trial registration. Our documentation categorized statements as ""Not Mentioned,"" ""Recommended,"" ""Not Accepted,"" or ""Required."" The category ""Not Accepted"" specifically indicated that the journal explicitly did not accept the study designs associated with certain reporting guidelines, rather than implying bias against these guidelines. ensure equitable evaluation, we communicated with each journal to confirm the types of articles they accepted. Among the 100 journals assessed, the CONSORT guideline emerged as the most frequently cited, with 60 journals recommending adherence and 13 requiring it. Conversely, the QUOROM guideline was the least commonly cited, with merely two journals recommending its adherence and none requiring it. Nineteen journals did not reference a single reporting guideline. Remarkably, clinical trial registration was required by 42 journals and recommended by 34. This study reveals variation in the adoption of reporting guidelines and clinical trial registration in immunology and allergy journals. While some journals strongly advocate for or require these practices, others do not emphasize them at all. This inconsistency affects research rigor and reproducibility, highlighting the need for stricter enforcement. Editors should encourage these practices to enhance transparency and minimize biases.",,,

Evidence-based practice offers health care professionals a systematic approach to applying research to improve patient outcomes. Despite positive attitudes toward EBP, PTs often struggle to translate scientific knowledge into clinical practice. While many frameworks emphasize the importance of organizational leadership in EBP, self-leadership, directing oneself toward personal goals, remains underexplored. The study included 860 participants: 158 DPT students, 235 early-career PTs with less than 10 years of clinical experience, and 467 late-career PTs with 10 or more years of experience. A cross-sectional online survey explored the relationship and group differences between Revised Self-Leadership Questionnaire scores and Evidence-Based Practice (EBP) Beliefs Scale scores among physical therapists and DPT students. The statistical analysis approaches included Spearman's Rank Correlations, Kruskal-Wallis H tests, and multiple stepwise regressions. Weak correlations existed between self-leadership and EBP beliefs in DPT students and late-career PTs, while a moderate correlation was observed in early-career PTs. Although self-leadership and EBP beliefs varied between groups, the differences were minor. Intrinsic DPT student and physical therapist characteristics showed minimal predictive value for EBP beliefs, highlighting the continued complexity of understanding EBP beliefs and implementation within the physical therapy profession. A persistent gap exists in understanding the clinician-specific factors influencing EBP beliefs in physical therapy. These findings emphasize the need to identify and cultivate factors positively affecting EBP adoption and self-leadership among physical therapists and students. Future research should look to understand the complex interplay between personal attributes and organizational dynamics to enhance EBP implementation in clinical practice.",,,egreen05@nyit.edu

In this review, we conceptualize inequality as an ecological construct and discuss why it matters for the mental health of populations and for individual clinical outcomes. We then discuss some of the key mechanisms through which economic inequality influences mental health beyond poverty itself: social comparison and social capital. We also consider how the effect might vary across specific vulnerable groups in the population, such as young people and minoritized communities. Finally, we discuss methodological challenges in studying the relationship between inequality and mental health and conclude by outlining future research directions and possible interventions at the governmental, community, and individual levels to mitigate the negative mental health consequences of economic inequality.",,,vikram_patel@hms.harvard.edu.
40333264,Regional Disparities in HPV Vaccination Coverage Among Girls Aged 9 to 14 Years in Togo: Lessons Learned from the Recent Supplementary Immunization Activities.,,Vaccines,10.3390/vaccines13040373,"Human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination is a critical intervention to prevent cervical cancer, especially in settings where screening is limited. In Togo, cervical cancer is the second most common cancer in women. Togo conducted an HPV vaccination campaign for girls aged 9-14 from 27 November to 1 December 2023, followed by introduction of the vaccine into routine immunization. This study aimed to assess regional disparities in vaccination coverage during this campaign. A cross-sectional study was conducted using data from the nationwide HPV vaccination campaign. The target population included girls aged 9-14, following school and community-based enumeration. The campaign employed school-based, health facility-based, and community-based vaccination strategies. Data were collected via multiple tools, and monitoring was carried out through daily reports and digital tracking. Out of the estimated 654,402 eligible girls, 304,457 (46.5%) were vaccinated. Vaccine coverage varied significantly by region, ranging from 76% in Kara to 15% in Grand Lomé. In-school settings accounted for 91.3% of vaccinations, with the fixed strategy covering 55.4%. In total, 11 districts exceeded 80% vaccine coverage, while 15 districts had <50%. The highest rate of adverse events following immunization was observed in the Maritime region, primarily involving minor symptoms. Although progress was made in HPV vaccination coverage in Togo, regional disparities highlight the need for targeted interventions. Strategies such as expanding vaccine access, enhancing awareness campaigns, and integrating HPV vaccination into routine immunization could improve coverage. Addressing logistical and cultural barriers is also crucial for equitable vaccination, aiming to achieve international benchmarks and reduce HPV-related disease burdens. Further research should explore qualitative factors influencing vaccine acceptance.",Landoh DE; Boko A; Adjeoda K; Toke YT; Amani A; Mouhoudine Y; Bwaka AM; Biey NJ; Wiysonge CS; Mboussou FFR; Looky-Djobo H; Tamekloe TA; Mangbassim TN; Kenao T; Diallo AB; Diallo FBT; Impouma B; Lindstrand A; Wotobe MK; Ekouevi DK,Fonds des Nations Unies pour L'enfance (UNICEF); Department of Immunization; World Health Organization; Centre de Formation et de Recherche en Santé Publique; Division de l'Immunisation; Ministère de la Santé,

To address these challenges, we introduce ChatOCT, an offline-capable, domain-adaptive clinical decision support system (CDSS) that integrates structured expert Q&A generation, OCT-specific knowledge injection, and activation-aware model compression. Unlike existing systems, ChatOCT functions without internet access, making it suitable for low-resource environments. ChatOCT is built upon LLaMA-2-7B, incorporating domain-specific knowledge from PubMed and OCT News through a two-stage training process: (1) knowledge injection for OCT-specific expertise and (2) Q&A instruction tuning for structured, interactive diagnostic reasoning. To ensure feasibility in offline environments, we apply activation-aware weight quantization, reducing GPU memory usage to ~ 4.74 GB, enabling deployment on standard OCT hardware. A novel expert answer generation framework mitigates hallucinations by structuring responses in a multi-step process, ensuring accuracy and interpretability. ChatOCT outperforms state-of-the-art baselines such as LLaMA-2, PMC-LLaMA-13B, and ChatDoctor by 10-15 points in coherence, relevance, and clinical utility, while reducing GPU memory requirements by 79%, while maintaining real-time responsiveness (~ 20 ms inference time). Expert ophthalmologists rated ChatOCT's outputs as clinically actionable and aligned with real-world decision-making needs, confirming its potential to assist frontline healthcare providers. ChatOCT represents an innovative offline clinical decision support system for optical coherence tomography (OCT) that runs entirely on local embedded hardware, enabling real-time analysis in resource-limited settings without internet connectivity. By offering a scalable, generalizable pipeline that integrates knowledge injection, instruction tuning, and model compression, ChatOCT provides a blueprint for next-generation, resource-efficient clinical AI solutions across multiple medical domains.",,,jyangoptics@gmail.com.

This study compares the impact of a societal versus a healthcare perspective on the cost effectiveness of treatment of primary progressive MS (PPMS) with ocrelizumab (OCR) versus best supportive care (BSC) in New Zealand. The analysis utilises a lifetime cohort Markov model based on ten Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) states, plus death. It has two structurally identical arms, with forward transition probabilities in the treatment arm obtained by multiplying forward transition probabilities (converted to rates, and back to probabilities) in the control arm by the 12-week disability progression hazard ratio in the clinical trial ORATORIO. Direct and indirect costs of MS were estimated from a 2017 Australian survey and converted to 2024 NZ dollars using purchasing power parity and the NZ consumer price index. Future costs and benefits were discounted at 3.5% per annum. The model is calibrated to NZ mortality for PPMS, and therapy ends when wheelchair dependence (EDSS7) is reached. For a modelled cohort 40 years of age starting at the ORATORIO distribution of EDSS, at 50% of the list price (viz. 50% rebate on $NZ37,384 per patient per annum), the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of OCR versus BSC is $NZ114,427 per QALY ($US64,651) from a societal perspective or $NZ146,711 ($US82,892) from a healthcare perspective. From a societal perspective, at Treasury's willingness to pay (WTP) criterion of $NZ120,200, an acquisition cost up to 56% of list price ($NZ20,935; 44% rebate) is justifiable. From a healthcare payer perspective, at Treasury's implied WTP of $NZ43,313, an acquisition cost up to 10% of list price ($NZ3738; 90% rebate) is justifiable. Based on this metric, a 5.6-fold higher investment in OCR can be justified from a societal perspective compared with a healthcare perspective. Alternatively, an acquisition cost up to 37.9% of list price (viz. 62.1% rebate or $NZ14,169) could be justified if the criterion of one GDP per capita ($NZ83,011) is used as a societal funding threshold. These results are sensitive to the cost of BSC from a societal perspective but not from a healthcare perspective. From both perspectives the cost effectiveness is sensitive to the acquisition cost and efficacy of OCR, potential waning of efficacy, the age and EDSS state when therapy begins, the cost and timing of entry of a biosimilar pharmaceutical and the discount rate. Treatment of PPMS with OCR is more cost effective from a societal than a healthcare perspective, therefore prioritisation of public funding of novel pharmaceuticals for MS and other resource intensive chronic health conditions will depend critically upon the study perspective.",Milne RJ; Schousboe C,Roche Singapore Pte Ltd; Health Outcomes Associates Ltd,richard.milne@hoa.co.nz.

This review aimed to analyze recent literature on diagnosis, classification, and radiologic characteristics of Basilar Invagination (BI) to generate recommendations on these topics. Basilar invagination diagnosis, classifications, and radiologic characteristics evolved during the last decade; however, many debatable criteria disturb a common language fundamental to compare clinical research. The WFNS Spine Committee organized two separate consensus meetings to discuss and create statements that were voted on to reach a consensus. Basilar invagination mainly results from a CVJ developmental abnormality and is often associated with congenital anomalies. There is also an acquired type that occurs by bone softening, such as rheumatoid arthritis. It can be classified as type I (atlantoaxial dislocation) and type II (without atlantoaxial dislocation) basilar invagination. Clinical signs may either be due to brainstem compression or cervical spinal cord compression and instability. Although many radiologic measurements are proposed, the most reliable ones are the McRae line, Chamberlain line, and Boogard angle. Diagnosis of basilar invagination should be made by midsagittal craniocervical x-rays, CTs or MRI. There are two types of basilar invagination: type I basilar invagination is associated with instability, and treatment can focus on stabilization. However, type II basilar invagination may need decompressive surgeries.",Dantas F; Botelho R,Pós-Graduação Faculdade de Ciências Médicas de Minas Gerais; Post-graduation Program in Health Sciences from IAMSPE-São Paulo-Brazil.,
40331728,The Reported Evidence of Nursing and Midwifery Mentorship Programmes Internationally: A Scoping Meta-Review Providing a Comprehensive Overview of Mentorship Programmes.,,Journal of advanced nursing,10.1111/jan.17028,"To synthesise and critically analyse existing reviews of evidence on mentorship in nursing and midwifery, providing a comprehensive overview of current knowledge. A scoping meta-review. The review was conducted using the scoping meta-review framework outlined by Sarrami-Foroushani et al. (2015), alongside the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines to ensure rigour and transparency. The following steps were included: (i) defining the problem, (ii) literature search and criteria, (iii) study selection and data extraction, (iv) data synthesis, (v) presentation of results and (vi) interpretation and recommendations. A comprehensive search strategy was designed, utilising Boolean operators, truncation and predefined keywords across seven databases including MEDLINE, CINAHL, Embase, PsycINFO, Epistemonikos, ERIC and Google Scholar. Following double-blind screening of 269 papers, 14 literature reviews were included. The findings provided a detailed overview of mentorship programme types (formal and informal), outcome measures used to evaluate mentorship effectiveness and recommendations for future programmes. Identified themes included skill development, job satisfaction, career progression and retention outcomes, together with challenges including time constraints and balancing clinical responsibilities with mentorship roles. Formal mentorship programmes that are adequately supported and integrated into the organisational culture can improve healthcare systems, workforce stability and patient outcomes. Informal mentorship continues to offer valuable, flexible support, particularly when used alongside formal structures. Implementation challenges exist, such as time constraints, limited organisational support, and mismatched mentor-mentee pairings. This review highlights the critical role of mentorship in nursing and midwifery, offering insights into effective practices, challenges and potential areas for further research. The findings suggest that formal, structured mentorship programmes produce consistent benefits, including enhanced clinical skills, confidence and satisfaction among mentees, as well as leadership development and professional fulfilment for mentors, while positively impacting organisational efficiency and patient outcomes. Successful mentorship programmes require organisational commitment, with protected time, resources, and ongoing mentor training. Mentorship programmes in nursing and midwifery enhance professional development, job satisfaction, and retention, enabling a stable healthcare workforce. Mentorship for mentors and mentees is linked to increased confidence, competency and readiness for advanced roles among nurses and midwives. Fostering mentorship in healthcare can lead to improved quality and continuity of care as mentees grow into more competent and confident practitioners. Formal mentorship programmes that are adequately supported and integrated into the organisational culture can improve healthcare systems, workforce stability and patient outcomes. Policymakers responsible for healthcare workforce development can use these findings to advocate for mentorship as a strategic investment, potentially influencing policies related to nurse retention, professional development and funding allocations for mentorship initiatives. Structured mentorship improves job satisfaction, reduces turnover and fosters professional growth, thus reducing costs associated with recruitment and training. The findings are reported in line with the PRISMA guidelines (Page et al., 2021) and through a narrative synthesis, summarising and analysing the results of various reviews to present a cohesive understanding of mentorship practices in nursing and midwifery. This method allowed for the integration of qualitative and quantitative findings and the identification of common themes and patterns across studies. Patients or members of the public did not directly contribute to this review. However, by focusing on mentorship practices that support nurses and midwives, the study indirectly addresses public interests, as improved mentoring contributes to the quality of patient care. Future studies could benefit from patient or public feedback on desired qualities in care providers, further informing the development of mentorship programmes aligned with patient-centred care outcomes.",Marie K; Aoife L,National Clinical Leadership Centre,

We report an exploratory analysis of patient-reported adverse events (AEs). Of 537 patients randomized to durvalumab + EP or EP arms, 164 were asked to complete the Patient-Reported Outcomes version of the Common Terminology Criteria (PRO-CTCAE) for AEs at baseline, every 3 weeks (q3w) during EP, then q4w until disease progression, then post-progression on day 28, 2 months, and q8w until second progression/death. Presence/absence, frequency, or severity of 11 selected AEs were examined during the first 24 weeks of treatment, alongside interference with usual/daily activities for five AEs. A minority of patients reported the examined AEs before starting treatment, from 3-5% who reported hand-foot syndrome, up to 34-41% for dry mouth. AE rates were generally comparable with baseline and the patterns of AEs reported by patients over time were similar in both treatment arms. Most patients indicated that reported AEs occurred rarely/occasionally and were mild/moderate in severity. These PRO-CTCAE data complement the clinician-reported AEs and give insight into patients' experience of treatment. www.clinicaltrials.gov identifier is NCT03043872. What is this article about?The CASPIAN clinical study, for patients with small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) that has spread beyond a single area (extensive-stage SCLC; ES-SCLC) who had not received any previous treatment, showed that patients treated with durvalumab plus chemotherapy had a better chance of living longer than patients treated with chemotherapy alone. Treatment for ES-SCLC causes side effects which add to the cancer-related symptoms that patients commonly experience and can impact quality of life. We investigated how a subset of patients in CASPIAN reported 11 side effects using a validated questionnaire developed by the US National Cancer Institute. Patients completed the questionnaire before starting treatment and at regular intervals during treatment.What were the results?We showed that patients treated with durvalumab plus chemotherapy reported a similar pattern of occurrence, frequency, and severity of side effects as patients treated with chemotherapy alone throughout the first 24 weeks of treatment. A comparable proportion of patients treated with durvalumab plus chemotherapy as of those treated with chemotherapy alone reported each side effect at any visit during this treatment period. Patients generally reported that side effects occurred only rarely or occasionally, or when present, as mild or moderately severe.What do the results mean?These findings give insight into patient experiences of treatment with durvalumab plus chemotherapy and support previously published results that this treatment prolongs the life of patients with ES-SCLC without adversely affecting patients’ perspectives on side effects and quality of life when compared to treatment with chemotherapy alone.",Garassino MC; Medic N; Mann H; Chugh P; Dalvi T,BPM Evidence; Late Development Oncology; Oncology Biometrics; Medical Oncology Division,

In this paper, we describe the co-production of an empathy-focused medical curriculum involving patients, educators, and students. We adopted the National Institute for Health Research co-production principles to develop three curriculum streams: 1) delivering evidence-based empathy lectures, 2) involving patients in biomedical science teaching, and 3) implementing longitudinal empathic communication and clinical skills teaching. Patients, educators, and students were purposefully sampled from one medical school. At least one co-production workshop was conducted for each curriculum stream, combined with written engagement. All participants were prepared, and patients were remunerated. Four co-production workshops took place between July 2023 and April 2024. There were 24 participants (eight patients, eight educators, and eight students). Co-production developed new lectures on the importance of therapeutic empathy, meaningful approaches to active patient involvement in biomedical science lectures, and communication and clinical skills training re-framed from a patient perspective. A longitudinal evaluation will assess the impact of these changes on students' empathy. Co-producing a medical curriculum can lead to important curricular changes, including greater integration of the patient voice across a five-year programme. Five key learning points can assist curriculum developers in their future efforts to co-produce medical curricula: 1) appoint an independent point-of-contact to support participants, 2) create a feedback loop, 3) encourage various modes of engagement, 4) explore and be open to all contributions, and 5) be transparent about the process.",,,

Large numbers of people diagnosed with breast cancer are working at the time of diagnosis. Accumulating evidence suggests that breast cancer survivors participate less often in paid work compared to others. Return to work among breast cancer survivors is multifactorial. It is currently unknown which factors are associated with return to work in breast cancer survivors. Therefore, it is important to systematically review and synthesize the literature on the association between sociodemographic, breast cancer-related, other health-related, personal, and work-related factors and return to work in this group of people. The objective is to systematically review and synthesize the literature on the association between sociodemographic, breast cancer-related, other health-related, personal, and work-related factors and return to work in the 24 months following breast cancer diagnosis among breast cancer survivors having paid work at the time of diagnosis. The search strategy included electronic searches in OVID/MEDLINE, Embase.com, EBSCOhost/CINAHL with Full Text, EBSCOhost/PsycINFO, Clarivate Analytics/Web of Science Core Collection and Wiley/Cochrane Library from inception up to 20 January 2023, as well as handsearching references of relevant reviews, included studies, and Google Scholar. The following inclusion criteria were applied: - The type of study is a prospective cohort study, retrospective cohort study with time lag between assessment of prognostic factor and outcome, or prognosis study based on a randomized controlled trial. - The study sample included people diagnosed with breast cancer, having paid work at the time of their breast cancer diagnosis. - At least one variable as specified in our variable framework was studied. - Return to work (yes/no), or time to return to work was assessed somewhere between one and 24 months of follow-up. - The article type is an original research article (commentaries, reviews, and editorials were excluded). - Full text of the article is available. - The article was published in a peer-reviewed journal. Study characteristics and estimates of unadjusted and adjusted associations between one of the variables from the pre-defined variable framework and return to work were extracted. Risk of bias was assessed using the Quality in Prognosis Studies (QUIPS) tool. When at least four adjusted or four unadjusted measures of association (e.g. Odds Ratio (OR)) were available and more or less comparable in terms of how the measures of association were included in the analysis of the original study, a meta-analysis was conducted. The systematic searches yielded 14,799 records with 2 identified via other sources. The systematic searches yielded 8486 references after duplicates were removed. We assessed 280 full-text articles for eligibility and excluded 249, including one article that was classified as 'awaiting classification' as it required professional translation.

From these, we could combine five factors in the meta-analyses. - We found low-quality evidence that higher age is associated with lower odds of return to work in an adjusted analysis (pooled adjusted OR 0.96, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.94 to 0.98; 4 studies, 1333 participants). - We found low-quality evidence that lower level of education is associated with lower odds of return to work in an unadjusted analysis (pooled unadjusted OR 0.40, 95% CI 0.29 to 0.55; 4 studies, 1680 participants), but not in an adjusted analysis (pooled adjusted OR 0.60, 95% CI 0.33 to 1.08; 4 studies, 1147 participants). - We found low-quality evidence that not having a partner is not associated with return to work in an unadjusted analysis (pooled unadjusted measures of association: 0.91 95% CI 0.67 to 1.23; 4 studies, 1680 participants). - We found low-quality evidence that receiving chemotherapy was associated with lower odds of return to work in an unadjusted analysis (pooled unadjusted measures of association: 0.48, 95% CI 0.31 to 0.73; 5 studies, 1766 participants). - We found low-quality evidence that receiving radiotherapy is not associated with return to work, respectively (pooled unadjusted measures of association: 1.03, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.17; 4 studies, 1680 participants). Due to the low number of included studies that measured the outcome, time to return to work, it was not possible to pool data of these studies. We found that higher age and receiving chemotherapy may be associated with lower odds of returning to work in breast cancer survivors (low-quality evidence; for chemotherapy, only pooled unadjusted results were available). Results regarding educational level are inconclusive. We furthermore found that there was no statistically significant adjusted association between having a partner and receiving radiotherapy (low-quality evidence; only unadjusted results were available). Further research is warranted to identify those breast cancer survivors who are at higher risk of not returning to work, so that they can receive timely support.",,,

This study aim to validate the consistency and clinical accuracy of the product by comparing the capillary blood glucose (CBG) with CGM data in both in-hospital and outpatient scenarios. Results of CGM devices were compared with random capillary glucose values from users in both in-hospital and outpatient settings. The accuracy of CGMs was assessed through consistency analysis, Bland-Altman analysis, calculation of MARD and MAD, Consensus Error Grids, as well as analysis using the Continuous Glucose Deviation Interval and Variability Analysis (CG-DIVA). In outpatient setting, 1907 values from 138 users were analyzed. FreeStyle Libre data, QT AIR calibrated and uncalibrated data showed strong positive correlations with capillary blood glucose values. The MARD values for the FreeStyle Libre, uncalibrated QT AIR, and calibrated QT AIR groups were 18.33%, 20.63%, and 12.39%, respectively. Consensus Error Grid, reference values in Zone A: FreeStyle Libre: 69.75%, QT AIR uncalibrated: 67.80%, QT AIR calibrated: 87.62%. The Bland-Altman analysis results suggest that FreeStyle Libre exhibitsed a systematic underestimation of blood glucose levels, while QT AIR almost rectified the differences. In the in-Hospital setting, the MARD of QT AIR after calibration was reduced to 7.24%. The Consensus error grid analyses of the in-Hospital data revealed that 95% of the calibrated QT AIR values fell within Zone A, a significantly higher proportion than that of other two group. The CG-DIVA analysis of the calibrated QT AIR device showed a median bias of -0.49% and a between-sensor variability of 26.65%, both of which are significantly lower than the corresponding values observed for the FreeStyle Libre device. We successfully transformed a retrospective CGM system into a real-time monitoring device. The monitoring accuracy of the device could be improved by calibration.",,,

Despite their widespread adoption, concerns persist regarding their efficacy and cost-effectiveness. This study aimed to assess the impact of the Pacaembu Field Hospital in São Paulo, Brazil during the COVID-19 pandemic, specifically focusing on lives saved and the associated public health costs. This retrospective cohort study was conducted April 6 to June 29. The 200-bed field hospital, a collaboration between Sociedade Beneficente Israelita Brasileira Albert Einstein and the São Paulo City Hall, São Paulo Municipal Health Departament, operated at Pacaembu Stadium and admitted. Adult patients with mild to moderate COVID-19. Electronic health records provided comprehensive data on demographics, clinical outcomes, and resource utilization. The mortality rate among field hospital patients was compared to that of two groups: I-confirmed COVID-19 cases in São Paulo, and II-severe acute respiratory syndrome patients with COVID-19 in São Paulo. A total of 152,928 COVID-19 cases were confirmed in São Paulo, with 20,603 patients hospitalized for ARDS and 1,499 patients admitted to the Pacaembu Field Hospital for mild to moderate disease. The median age of Pacaembu patients was 57 years (IQR 46-67), with 43.8% aged 60 or older. Lung disease was the most common comorbidity, affecting 31.0% of cases. The median length of stay was 4.2 days, and 14.2% of patients required intensive care, with 7.9% needing mechanical ventilation. The hospital had a survival rate of 99.8%. The cost per year of life saved, adjusted for gender, was R$44,243.02 (US$8,208.35). In the most favorable scenario, approximately 200 lives were saved, with a cost of R$5,640.92 (US$1,046.55) per life saved for both genders. In the least favorable scenario, around 50 lives were saved, with a cost of R$36,863.48 (US$6,839.24) per life saved for both genders, all within cost-effectiveness thresholds.

However, quantitative data on these practices and health outcomes in semi-intensive broiler farms in low-income settings is limited. A longitudinal study in Wakiso, Uganda, aimed to evaluate biosecurity practices, health performance, and antibiotic use in such farms. The FarmUSE survey tool was used to collect data from 19 farms over two production cycles. A biosecurity risk assessment tool was used to quantify biosecurity. Blood samples (n = 342) were collected and analyzed using the ProFLOK® assay to assess antibody responses to vaccines for Newcastle disease (NCD), Infectious Bronchitis (IB), and Infectious bursal disease (IBD). Median biosecurity scores were 26.3 % for external measures, 55.6 % for internal measures, and an overall score of 38.5 %. Sixteen farms reported respiratory signs, and 12 had gastrointestinal issues, with median mortality rates of 2.9 % in the first cycle and 4.6 % in the second. Antibiotic use was reported by 84 % and 77 % of farms in the first and second cycles, respectively. The most used antibiotics were tetracyclines, fluoroquinolones, and macrolides, with the highest usage occurring during the brooding phase. Good antibody responses were reported in only 10.5 % of flocks for NCD and 16 % for IBD, while all farms had poor responses against IB. Recurrent clinical signs could be attributed to insufficient biosecurity and inadequate vaccination outcomes, resulting in high antibiotic usage despite low mortality rates. Improving diagnostic access and strengthening the vaccine supply chain are essential. Identifying feasible and cost-effective biosecurity practices for semi-intensive broiler farms can enhance health outcomes, reduce antibiotic use, and boost productivity.",,,

We aimed to determine the interaction of key brain imaging features and the effect of treatment on clinical outcomes. ENCHANTED2/MT was a prospective, randomised, open-label, blinded-endpoint, controlled trial that aimed to assess the effectiveness of different intensities of blood pressure control on the functional independence in patients who had received successful endovascular therapy for acute ischaemic stroke from large-vessel occlusion at 44 hospitals in China between July 20, 2020 and March 7, 2022. In these pre-specified secondary analyses, neuroradiologists reviewed the baseline brain images of participants (computerised tomography [CT], CT with angiography [CTA] and digital subtraction angiography [DSA]) blind to treatment allocation, to determine the degree of cerebral infarction on the Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score (ASPECTS), collateral status according to modified TAN score, and degree of reperfusion on the expanded Treatment In Cerebral Infarction (eTICI) scale.

Nonetheless,  To longitudinally evaluate use of the Learn Together guidance in practice-designed to support patient and family involvement in investigations of healthcare harm. A 15-month process evaluation took place across five sites, following 29 investigations in which the Learn Together guidance was used. Sites comprised two mental health and two physical health hospital Trusts, and an independent maternity investigatory body in England. Longitudinally, 127 interviews were conducted with investigators, patients, families, staff, and management. Interview and observational data were synthesized using Pen Portraits and analyzed using multi-case thematic analysis. The guidance supported the systematic involvement of patients and families in investigations of healthcare harm and informed them how, why, and when to be involved across settings. However, within hospital Trusts, investigators often had to conduct ""pre-investigations"" to source appropriate details of people to contact, juggle ethical dilemmas of involving vs. re-traumatizing, and work within contexts of unclear organizational processes and responsibilities. These issues were largely circumvented when investigations were conducted by an independent body, due to better established processes, infrastructure and resources, however independence did introduce challenge to the rebuilding of relationships between families and the hospital Trust. Across settings, the involvement of patients and families fluctuated over time and sharing a draft investigation report marked an important part of the process-perhaps symbolic of organizational ethos surrounding involvement. This was made particularly difficult within hospital Trusts, as investigators often had to navigate systemic barriers alone. Organizational learning was also a challenge across settings. Investigations of healthcare harm are complex, relational processes that have the potential to either repair, or compound harm. The Learn Together guidance helped to support patient and family involvement and the evaluation led to further revisions, to better inform and support patients, families and investigators in ways that meet their needs (https://learn-together.org.uk). In particular, the five-stage process is designed to center the needs of patients and families to be heard, and their experiences dignified, before moving to address organizational needs for learning and improvement. However, as a healthcare system, we call for more formal recognition, support and training for the complex challenges investigators face-beyond clinical skills, as well as the appropriate and flexible infrastructure to enable a receptive organizational culture and context for meaningful patient and family involvement.",,,
40330406,No Difference in Pain and Activities of Daily Living Between Immobilization in External and Internal Rotation Following Acute Anterior Shoulder Dislocation: Results of a Randomized Controlled Trial.,,Cureus,10.7759/cureus.81732,"Background The conventional treatment for anterior shoulder dislocations is immobilising the arm in adduction and internal rotation. However, recent basic science and clinical data indicate that immobilization in external rotation can reduce recurrent instability. The use of external rotation brace is not widespread, due to compliance and convenience issues. The purpose of our study is to compare pain and restriction in day-to-day activities experienced by patients after being immobilized in the two types of braces (external rotation and internal rotation) at the end of one week. Methods Between February 2023 to July 2024, 50 patients with acute shoulder dislocation (primary or recurrent) were randomized (concealed, computer-generated) to immobilization with either an internal rotation brace (n=26) or an external rotation brace (n=24). Validated scores (Pain-visual analog scale (VAS) for pain, Katz Index for independence in activities of daily living) were used to collect data on the day of Immobilization and at the end of one week of immobilization. Results There was no statistically significant difference (P>0.05) in Pain-VAS and Katz Index scores among the two brace types (external rotation and internal rotation) at the end of one week of follow-up. There was no loss in follow-up in either of our study groups. Conclusion Immobilization in external rotation after reduction of acute shoulder dislocation did not significantly differ from immobilization in internal rotation in terms of pain and limitations in activities of daily living experienced by the patient in the first week of immobilization.",,,

Given that previous research has focused primarily on patients, the impact on their family members is relatively underexplored. In this context, we aimed to evaluate the health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and psychosocial burden of both minor patients and their families. Methods This study involved 151 children/adolescents with type 1 diabetes and family members of such patients, both living in Greece. We applied a combined e-questionnaire including demographic and clinical data, psychological burden data as reflected by the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale - 21 Items (DASS-21), and HRQoL data as reflected by the 36-Item Short Form Survey (SF-36). Statistical analysis included descriptive statistics and inferential analysis. Results Regarding psychological burden, our study revealed mild to normal depression levels (10.6 ± 5.6), mild to moderate stress levels (16.2 ± 5.8), and moderate anxiety levels (10.6 ± 5.6); therefore, anxiety seems to prevail among psychological burden conditions. Regarding HRQoL, moderate levels of overall physical health (50.5 ± 12.7) and moderate to low levels of overall mental health (44.5 ± 13.2) were observed. Stress, anxiety, depression, and HRQoL tend to be significantly influenced by various demographic and clinical attributes. As expected, an inverse correlation between HRQoL and psychological burden was observed. Conclusion The treatment of pediatric type 1 diabetes seems to be a family matter, given that family members are deeply involved in the general run of things. To enhance HRQoL and resilience against psychological burden for minor patients, both the patients and their caregivers/parents should be supported accordingly.",,,
40330393,Statistical Power Analyses for Quantifying the Similarity of Categories of Surgical Procedures Among Pairs of Hospitals and Ambulatory Facilities.,,Cureus,10.7759/cureus.81761,"Mixed methods are often used to understand organizational associations and differences. For example, one might compare hospitals and ambulatory surgery centers, each described by its relative distribution of cases' categories of surgical procedures, quantified using anesthesia Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) codes. The similarity of these distributions between facilities can be assessed using a metric akin to a correlation coefficient. Conceptually, identifying similar organizational pairs is feasible, as most U.S. states and Canadian provinces maintain databases containing such administrative data. However, research proposals based on mixed methods may be hindered by the lack of statistical power analysis to determine whether the quantitative phase will yield a sufficient number of similar facilities to support the qualitative phase (i.e., interviews). Data were obtained from the American Society of Anesthesiologists' National Anesthesia Clinical Outcomes Registry. The dataset included 12,902,159 cases across 272 procedure categories, performed at 2442 facilities in the United States. The similarity index between facilities ranged from 0 (no overlap in surgical procedures) to 1 (identical distribution of procedures). Values ≥0.80 were considered indicative of high similarity. We estimated the proportion of highly similar facility pairs (similarity index ≥0.80) with low standard errors (<2.0). For each pair, we computed the inverse of the standard normal distribution based on the ratio of the difference from 0.80 to the standard error. The average of these values yielded the mean prevalence of high similarity. This estimated prevalence was then used in power analyses based on the binomial distribution. Only 1.00% (standard error: 0.01%) of facility pairs had a similarity index ≥0.80. Based on this prevalence, a database would need to include just 38 organizations to have an ≥80% probability of identifying at least five highly similar pairs for interviews. With data from 67 organizations, there would be a ≥95% probability of identifying at least 15 pairs. In contrast, consider an individual organization deciding whether to (a) join a consortium to identify similar organizations for shared strategies, or (b) invest in analysts to explore mandatory state or provincial databases for such purposes. Unless more than 1,000, and ideally more than 2,100, organizations contribute data, the probability of finding multiple highly similar peers may be low. Investigators can expect a high probability of obtaining sufficient organizational sample sizes for qualitative interviews when using large-scale databases. Although only a small fraction (approximately 1%) of organization pairs exhibit high similarity, the sheer number of potential pairs in state, provincial, and national databases compensates for this. However, for an individual organization seeking to identify peers for qualitative comparison, the chance of finding highly similar matches based on similar surgical procedures is extremely low, unless joining a very large data collective.",Dutton RP,Anesthesia,

Results Peripartum cardiomyopathy (n = 10, 27.78%) and rheumatic heart disease (n = 10, 27.78%) were the most prevalent cardiac conditions, followed by prosthetic valve disease and acyanotic congenital heart disease, each contributing to 11.11% (n = 4) of cases. A significant proportion of patients (n = 20, 55.56%) presented between 32 and 37 weeks of gestation. The study observed a maternal mortality rate of 13.89% (n = 5), with a stark contrast between women with an EF of <30% (n = 4, 33.33% mortality) and those with an EF of ≥30% (n = 1, 4.17% mortality). ICU admissions were required in 22.22% (n = 8) of cases, predominantly in women with an EF of <30% (n = 6, 50% vs. n = 2, 8.33%).

The underlying metabolic disorder is caused by a mutation in a gene responsible for regulating fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) activity. Loss of regulation of FGF23 results in hyperphosphatemia resulting in the characteristic tissue calcinosis deposits, especially in periarticular locations.

However, it is crucial to be aware of the risks and limitations associated with this technique. We present an extremely rare case of a 44-year-old male patient diagnosed with cerebral venous thrombosis of the transverse and sigmoid venous sinuses complicated by hemorrhagic lesions, who developed a high-risk PE within 24 hours of admission. Due to concomitant contraindications for anticoagulation in a patient with intracranial hemorrhage, the FlowTriever® system was chosen as the preferred intervention despite its associated risks. CDT was performed, provoking right ventricular perforation and cardiac tamponade immediately after the procedure. Only one previous case has been reported describing this extremely rare complication following FlowTriever® CDT. We reviewed the literature on indications, efficacy, and safety of this procedure, as well as our experience with this technique in patients with intermediate-high- and high-risk PE, clarifying whether prior reports included only FlowTriever® or other CDT devices.

This comprehensive review discusses the pathophysiology, clinical manifestations, diagnostic strategies, and management approaches for IH. The disorder arises from a multifaceted interplay of renal, intestinal, and skeletal factors. Impaired renal tubular calcium reabsorption, heightened intestinal calcium absorption, and increased bone resorption are key contributors to its pathogenesis. Genetic predispositions, including mutations in calcium-regulating receptors and transporters, further complicate its etiology. Patients often present with kidney stones, bone pain, or reduced bone mineral density, although asymptomatic cases are not uncommon. Diagnosing IH requires a thorough evaluation to exclude secondary causes, with 24-hour urinary calcium excretion serving as a crucial diagnostic marker. Management focuses on mitigating complications and improving quality of life through hydration, dietary modifications, and pharmacological therapy. Thiazide diuretics are the cornerstone of treatment, effectively reducing urinary calcium levels and preventing stone formation. Adjunctive measures include citrate supplementation and lifestyle interventions such as weight management and adequate physical activity. For patients with severe nephrolithiasis or nephrocalcinosis, surgical intervention may be necessary. Despite significant advancements, IH remains a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge due to its diverse clinical presentations and underlying mechanisms. A multidisciplinary approach, incorporating tailored medical and dietary strategies, is essential for optimal management. Future research into its genetic and molecular basis holds promise for developing more targeted interventions and improving patient outcomes. This review aims to provide a practical, up-to-date guide for clinicians managing this complex yet common metabolic disorder.",,,
40330357,Outcomes in Patients with Long COVID-19 One Year After their Discharge from Intensive Care Units.,,Cureus,10.7759/cureus.81739,"Introduction Survivors of prolonged severe COVID-19 who are treated at ICUs are at risk for physical and psychological complications, including lung injury and multi-organ dysfunction. As the number of survivors of severe COVID-19 increases, it is necessary to understand the trajectory of the disease and the patient care needed after discharge from the ICU. This study tries to efficiently assess the long-term clinical sequelae among patients with prolonged severe COVID-19 who were admitted to the ICU, one year after their discharge. The parameters tested included the chronic obstructive pulmonary disease assessment test (CAT) score, pulmonary function tests, and laboratory data. Materials and methods The study population included 454 patients who were followed up one year after surviving ICU admission for severe COVID-19. All the patients who presented with signs and symptoms to the hospital were examined further. They underwent the necessary investigations, assessments, and systemic examinations. The results of all the laboratory and radiological investigations were reviewed. During the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, all the patient details were entered into a hospital information management system from which the data was retrieved. Mean with standard deviation (SD) or median or interquartile ranges (IQR) were used to assess the continuous variables, whereas numbers and percentages were used for categorical variables. Statistical significance was calculated by the Chi-square test. Results The median age of the study population was 64 (IQR 57-74) years and 64.7% (294/454) were male patients. The median follow-up time was 367 days. During the follow-up period, 14.9% (68/454) of the patients were readmitted to the ICU. The mean length of hospital stay was 12 days (IQR 8-20 days). Among the readmitted patients (n=68), 17.6% (12/68) were on mechanical ventilation and the remaining 82.3% (56/68) received oxygen therapy. One patient underwent extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. The hospital mortality rate observed among these ICU survivors was 10.2%. The Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQOL) score at baseline i.e. before the ICU admission (52.5 (SD, 9.2); p<0.001) was better than that observed at the one-year follow-up (44.3 (SD, 9.5); p<0.001). Moreover, the clinical frailty scale and cognitive symptoms were significantly different at the follow up assessment versus the baseline (p<0.001). The proportion of patients with a grade of 0-2 on the Modified Medical Research Council (mMRC) dyspnea scale was almost similar at baseline and the one-year follow-up, whereas a breathlessness grade of 3-4 on the scale was observed in 39.8% of the study population. Conclusion The management of ICU survivors after severe COVID requires a multi-disciplinary approach. It includes preventive measures and rehabilitation services along with appropriate treatment strategies to relieve the residual symptoms.",,,

The Children Oral Health-Related Quality of Life framework comprises multidimensional scales that measure the negative impact of oral health issues on a child's well-being and daily functioning. One such tool is the Child Perceptions Questionnaire for children aged 11-14 years (CPQ11-14). This study aims to assess the association between oral health status and oral health-related quality of life (OHRQoL) among 12-year-old schoolchildren in the Nellore district of Andhra Pradesh. A cross-sectional survey was conducted among 12-year-old schoolchildren attending government schools in the Nellore district, Andhra Pradesh. Child perception was evaluated using the Telugu-translated CPQ11-14 questionnaire. Oral health status was clinically examined through assessment of oral hygiene status and dental caries. Spearman correlation was conducted to assess the relationship between CPQ11-14 scores and oral health status. A total of 450 schoolchildren participated in the study. The overall mean CPQ11-14 score was 17.22. CPQ scores showed a weak positive correlation with the Simplified Oral Hygiene Index (OHI-S) (0.005) and the Decayed, Missing, and Filled Teeth Index (DMFT) (0.05). Poor oral health status and dental caries had a negative impact on the OHRQoL of children.",,,

In recent years, surgical methods have played a very important role in the treatment of obesity and metabolic diseases. This study aims to investigate the effects of patients' socioeconomic status (SES) on the early results of sleeve gastrectomy (SG), which is the most preferred metabolic bariatric surgery (MBS) procedure in the world. Methods Data of SG patients who were operated on in the general surgery clinic of a tertiary hospital were analyzed retrospectively. A total of 322 patients who completed at least three months of follow-up after surgery were included in the study. Patients were divided into three groups - low, medium, and high - according to their SES. The effects of SES on weight loss and comorbidities associated with obesity were evaluated. The one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), Kruksal Wallis, and chi-square tests were used in the statistical analysis of the data. Results The groups were homogeneous in terms of age and body mass index (BMI). There was no statistically significant difference among income groups in terms of the age, BMI, and excess weight loss (EWL) variables (p>0.05). In addition, when the relations among income groups and gender, diabetes mellitus (DM), and other diseases were examined, it was concluded that there was no relation between income status and other variables (p>0.05). Conclusion SES of patients has no effect on the early results of SG.",,,

Reporting according to risk stratification can aid in a better understanding between clinicians and pathologists and the triage of patients. All serous effusion samples were collected and reported according to the guidelines of the Indian Academy of Cytologists. The risk of malignancy for each category was assessed, and immunological typing for atypical cases was performed. A total of 364 fluid samples from different age groups ranging from nine to 82 years were examined, of which 206/364 (56.5%) were pleural fluid and 158/364 (43.5%) were peritoneal fluid samples. The majority of fluids belonged to category II in both pleural (137/206, 66.5%) and peritoneal fluids (113/137, 71.5%), whereas only 9/206 (3.5%) of pleural fluid and 8/133 (5.1%) of peritoneal fluid samples were malignant. The maximum risk of malignancy was assessed for category V, followed by categories IV, III, I, and II. Immunocytochemical analysis showed cytokeratin (CK) positivity in two pleural fluid samples, whereas carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) positivity was observed in seven pleural and eight peritoneal fluid samples. The Indian Academy of Cytologists' recommendations for reporting effusion cytology utilize a five-tiered reporting system that is feasible and mitigates subjective variation in reporting.",,,
40330332,"Exploring Knowledge of Hypertension and Treatment Adherence in Hypertensive Patients From Lahore, Pakistan.",,Cureus,10.7759/cureus.81762,"Objective This study aims to explore key factors influencing hypertension management, including demographic (e.g., age, gender, education level), clinical (e.g., presence of comorbid conditions), and behavioral influences (e.g., medication adherence, lifestyle choices such as diet and exercise). The study seeks to provide specific insights into the gaps in knowledge of hypertension and treatment adherence and identify potential barriers to effective treatment and lifestyle modifications. Methods This study was carried out in the Departments of Medicine and Cardiology at Chaudhary Muhammad Akram Teaching and Research Hospital, Azra Naheed Medical College, Superior University, Lahore, Pakistan, from November 2024 to February 2025. A total of 252 hypertensive patients, diagnosed for at least six months, aged ≥18 years, and of both genders, were enrolled using a nonprobability consecutive sampling technique after informed consent. Patients were excluded if they were unable to complete the questionnaire, had hypertensive emergencies, were critically ill or in the ICU, had an active myocardial infarction or stroke, were undergoing hemodialysis, or had a pre-existing psychiatric illness. A structured questionnaire was completed by the patients, collecting details including demographic and clinical information, the 12-item Hypertension Knowledge Test (HKT), and a 10-item domain regarding practices of hypertension control and treatment adherence. Both these questionnaires have been validated in previous studies. All data were entered into IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, Version 23 (Released 2015; IBM Corp., Armonk, New York) for statistical analysis. Results The mean age was 47.6±12.9 years, with 133 (52.8%) participants aged ≥45 years. The majority were female (154, 61.1%). Of the 252 patients, 201 (79.8%) were married, 136 (54.0%) had ≤5 years of education, and 152 (60.3%) were employed. The mean duration of hypertension was 7.7±6.0 years, with 146 (57.9%) having hypertension for ≥6 years. Diabetes mellitus was present in 134 (53.2%), ischemic heart disease in 94 (37.3%), and chronic kidney disease in 28 (11.1%). A positive family history of hypertension was reported in 179 (71.0%). The mean HKT score was 7.1±2.0, with the majority (203, 80.6%) having poor knowledge. A significant statistical association of good knowledge was seen with younger age (p <0.001), being unmarried (p = 0.001), being educated (p <0.001), being employed (p <0.001), duration of hypertension ≤5 years (p = 0.039), absence of ischemic heart disease (p = 0.002), absence of chronic kidney disease (p = 0.024), and having a positive family history (p <0.001). No association was seen with gender (p = 0.336) or diabetes mellitus (p = 0.053). Regarding medication adherence, 26 (10.3%) always forget to take their medication, while 65 (25.8%) do so most of the time. In terms of healthcare management, 68 (27.0%) always make their next doctor's appointment before leaving the office, while 99 (39.3%) do so most of the time. However, 21 (8.3%) have missed a scheduled appointment, and 54 (21.4%) do so most of the time. Conclusion This study underscores a significant gap in knowledge of hypertension and suboptimal adherence to treatment among hypertensive patients and highlights the need for educational programs and strategies to promote treatment adherence, especially among older patients and those with lower educational levels.",,,

A retrospective analysis was conducted on 88 irradiation sessions in nine cases of motion-tracking irradiation for liver tumors. Two gold markers were placed near the tumor, and a planning target volume (PTV) margin of 5 mm was set. The interruption threshold for potential difference (PD) (the statistical prediction value of the three-dimensional (3D) distance error from the predictive model) was set at 3.0 mm during treatment. PDvalues obtained before and during treatment, as well as the number of interruptions, were analyzed. A multiple regression analysis was performed to evaluate the influence of various planning parameters, which were obtained during four-dimensional (4D) treatment planning, on the 95th percentile value of PD (PD",,,

This study explores oceanic feelings psychometrically, by examining their connections with spirituality, schizotypy, and personality organization. A sample of 480 adult non-clinical participants (66.2% female) completed an online survey, which included the Oceanic Feeling Scale, the MI-RSWB-18, SPQ-B, and the IPO-16. All relationships were evaluated in a path analysis to assess the direct and indirect effects of positive and negative oceanic feelings on schizotypy, connectedness, and general religiosity, with personality organization as a mediator. Positive oceanic feelings were strongly correlated with increased connectedness ( The findings reveal a dual role of oceanic feelings: positive oceanic feelings enhance general religiosity and connectedness independently of personality organization, while negative oceanic feelings are mediated by personality dysfunction, influencing schizotypy and spirituality. Strengthening personality organization could serve as a protective factor against the destabilizing effects of negative oceanic experiences, offering insights for psychotherapy and spiritual counselling.",,,

However, the comorbidity of hypersomnia with CHR-P and its treatment have rarely been reported or discussed. A 16-year-old female diagnosed with major depressive disorder and CHR-P experienced worsening excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS), including falling sleep in class. Polysomnography and multiple sleep latency tests confirmed the diagnosis of idiopathic hypersomnia (IH), and treatment with modafinil (100 mg/day) was initiated. EDS improved after increasing the modafinil dose to 200 mg/day. No side effects or exacerbations of psychotic symptoms were observed. EDS recurred after she entered university and was treated with 300 mg/day of modafinil without side effects or transition to psychosis. This case demonstrates modafinil's efficacy and safety in treating IH in individuals with CHR-P. However, whether modafinil use increases the risk of transition to psychosis remains unclear. Further research is required on modafinil as a treatment for hypersomnia in individuals with CHR-P.",,,

40329772,Suppression of Deactivation of Working Memory and Promotion of Activation of Sustained Attention in the Default Mode Network Are Affected by Schizotypy in a Large Sample of Nonclinical Subjects.,2025-05-07,Brain and behavior,10.1002/brb3.70449,"Schizotypy is a personality trait characterized by subclinical expression of the signs and symptoms of schizophrenia. Maladaptive schizotypy is given the clinical designation of schizotypal personality disorder. Previous studies have shown that functional disturbance of the default mode network (DMN) is associated with maladaptive schizotypy. Working memory impairment is a particularly common feature of maladaptive schizotypy and schizophrenia. As these characteristics can also be observed in the healthy population, our purpose was to identify the neural correlates of schizotypy during sustained attention tasks and working memory tasks in nonclinical subjects. We recruited 409 healthy individuals (251 men and 158 women; 20.7 ± 1.8 [SD] years of age) and determined their schizotypy scores using the Schizotypal Personality Questionnaire. We used a typical functional MRI (fMRI) task under 0-back and 2-back conditions. Corrections for multiple comparisons were performed via the threshold-free cluster enhancement method with a familywise error-corrected threshold of p < 0.0167 (0.05/3) at the whole-brain level, including the cerebellum. Suppression of deactivation of the DMN (the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), the posterior cingulate cortex, the inferior parietal lobule, and the middle temporal gyrus) in the working memory (2-back > rest) task and promotion of activation during the sustained attention (0-back > rest) task were associated with schizotypy scores. Among the schizotypy subscores, cognitive-perceptual deficits were significantly related only to the left precuneus, the mPFC, and the superior temporal gyrus for the 2-back > 0-back contrast; to the left precuneus and the bilateral mPFC for the 2-back > rest contrast; and to the left superior temporal cortex and the right precuneus for the 0-back > rest contrast within the DMN. Disturbance of the DMN is related to the degree of schizotypy, especially to the degree of cognitive‒perceptual deficits, even in nonclinical subjects.",Araki T,ADVANTAGE Risk Management Co.,

Its enactment in daily practice remains challenging, with nurses' insufficient research capacity and capability being one challenge, and the limited current state of knowledge another. To map the knowledge landscape around capacity-building programmes aiming to increase evidence-based nursing practice and research activity in acutecare hospitals. Scoping review using Joanna Briggs Institute methodology and PRISMA-ScR reporting guidelines. Articles from 2013 to 2023 were searched on PubMed, CINAHL, Medline/OVID, Cochrane Library, PsycINFO, Scopus and Web of Science. Two researchers screened their eligibility independently. To be eligible, studies needed to focus on nursing/midwifery in acute care settings, address research capacity-building practices and be either an empirical, review or theoretical publication. Data were extracted in a structured format and synthesised narratively. Twenty-four articles were included, consisting of 12 empirical, 6 reviews and 6 non-data-based articles. Our analysis identified two dimensions of research capacity: (1) individual research capability and (2) organisational research capacity, each influenced by various determinants. Findings suggest that four key elements are required to build a research capacity programme: (1) context assessment, (2) multilevel leadership and management engagement, (3) programme tailored to context and (4) clear outcome indicators. We found nursing research capacity programmes lacked clear definitions and a consensus on a conceptual framework. This review systematically synthesised the knowledge landscape on nursing research capacity building programmes in acute care hospitals, bringing clarity regarding concepts, dimensions, determinants and structural key elements. The conceptual model developed through this review encourages comprehensive and comparable research capacity-building programmes, which can accelerate enhancement of research skills, literacy, activities and evidence-based practice among nurses, thereby improving quality of care and patient outcomes.

This study aims to demonstrate the applicability of an integrated DEPArray-based phenotypic analysis combined with transcriptomic characterization to investigate the biology of CTCs isolated from 10 patients with metastatic breast cancer (MBC). The transcriptional profiles of CTCs were consistent with both the cancer type and epithelial characteristics. Gene set enrichment analysis identified pathways associated with synapse organization and calcium channel activity. Furthermore, distinct gene expression profiles were linked to specific metastatic sites, particularly bone metastases. We also report a rare and understudied population of CTCs, characterized by the co-expression of epithelial and leukocyte markers, observed exclusively in patient-derived samples and not in blood samples from healthy volunteers spiked with SKBR-3 and MCF-7 cell lines. This suggests that these double-positive CTCs (dpCTCs) may have a specific role in the metastatic process. The transcriptomic characterization of these rare CTCs enhances our understanding of their biology and potential involvement in metastasis. As a pilot study, our findings underscore the potential of CTC-based transcriptomics as a valuable tool for advancing clinical and biological understanding of MBC, particularly regarding metastatic mechanisms and organotropism. Moreover, it provides preliminary insights into dpCTCs, a poorly characterized population that may play a pivotal role in metastasis but remains largely unexplored. These findings could pave the way for developing targeted therapies aimed at the pathways driving metastasis and for improving patient monitoring through CTC profiling.",Palleschi M; Musolino A; De Giorgi U,Medical Oncology; Department of Medical Oncology,tania.rossi@irst.emr.it.

Data can be analyzed using advanced statistical methods (eg, machine learning) and shared with clinicians to aid assessment of people with psychosis' mental health, enabling timely intervention. Such methods show promise in detecting early signs of psychosis relapse. However, little is known about clinicians' views on the use of DRM for psychosis. This study explores multi-disciplinary staff perspectives on using DRM in practice. Fifty-nine mental health professionals were interviewed about their views on DRM in psychosis care. Interviews were analyzed using reflexive thematic analysis. Study Results: Five overarching themes were developed, each with subthemes: (1) the perceived value of digital remote monitoring; (2) clinicians' trust in digital remote monitoring (3 subthemes); (3) service user factors (2 subthemes); (4) the technology-service user-clinician interface (2 subthemes); and (5) organizational context (2 subthemes). Participants saw the value of using DRM to detect early signs of relapse and to encourage service user self-reflection on symptoms. However, the accuracy of data collected, the impact of remote monitoring on therapeutic relationships, data privacy, and workload, responsibility and resource implications were key concerns. Policies and guidelines outlining clinicians' roles in relation to DRM and comprehensive training on its use are essential to support its implementation in practice.

Among the individuals who are mandated to report under the law are professionals working with IPV victims and perpetrators in their practice. However, little is known about which characteristics are associated with compliance with the mandatory reporting of IPV (MR-IPV) law, on the one hand, and choosing not to report IPV, on the other. The current study sampled 357 professionals from 6 different agencies working with IPV victims and/or perpetrators. Six dichotomous outcome variables of compliance with MR-IPV and choosing not to report were analyzed by multiple logistic regression. The independent variables were professionals' perceptions and knowledge of MR-IPV, context and workplace conditions, and experience with IPV cases and risk assessment. Findings showed that risk of compliance with MR-IPV varied between complying with and without consent. Perceived applicability of MR-IPV for an IPV victim was the only variable that had significantly positively odds ratio for both compliance with and without consent. For choosing not to report, significant variables varied between whether the incident had taken place sometime throughout participants' careers or during the last year, and whether it concerned a victim or a perpetrator. However, knowledge of MR-IPV, experience with IPV cases, expectations of MR-IPV, perceived workplace time management, and perception of compliance were significant for choosing not to report. Knowledge of the characteristics that are associated with professionals' compliance with MR-IPV is essential to better understand the application of MR-IPV, to implement practice that is consistent with law, and ultimately to prevent IPV.

This study aimed to explore current barriers and facilitators from the perspective of health personnel at Tamale Teaching Hospital and Kings Medical Centre in the clinical management of severe acute malnutrition (SAM) among children (6-59 months). This study used a qualitative research approach and employed a semi-structured interview guide, interviews (key informants), in-depth interviews, and focus group discussions. A total of 30 staff from both facilities, who were directly involved in SAM management, were purposively sampled. The research explored areas of SAM management, including workload, training, referrals, staff collaboration, therapeutic formula availability and vital infrastructure. Findings The findings revealed a lack of standardised training, emphasising the critical role of capacity development for effective case management. The absence of ready-to-use therapeutic food in both facilities, worsened by global economic crises, has led to reliance on locally formulated alternatives. Late referrals, high workloads and limited staff collaboration were highlighted as notable obstacles, impacting the overall quality of care. The enablers of SAM management included integration between nutrition and healthcare services, the availability of locally prepared therapeutic formulae, albeit limited, supportive infrastructure, and successful collaboration with hospital administration. This study revealed critical obstacles and facilitators in the management of SAM among children (6-59 months). Recommendations are geared towards providing training protocols for health professionals, enhancing supply chain mechanisms to ensure the availability of therapeutic foods, and fostering a culture of collaboration within healthcare teams. Thus, when these challenges are addressed while at the same time leveraging existing enablers, health systems can significantly improve treatment outcomes of SAM cases. The findings will inform policy decisions by governmental bodies, health systems, and non-governmental organisations, guiding resource allocation, effective interventions, and overall improvement in care for malnourished children.",,,yaktammy@gmail.com.
40329302,"Systemic inequities, dignity, and trust in the context of HIV care: a qualitative analysis.",2025-05-07,International journal for equity in health,10.1186/s12939-025-02481-8,"Adherence and retention in care are key targets to achieve favorable health outcomes for people with HIV. Challenges with adherence and retention are pronounced for marginalized communities facing intersectional structural oppression. Community health worker delivery of Managed Problem Solving (MAPS+), an evidence-based behavioral intervention, has the potential to improve adherence and retention, yet understanding structural inequities affecting people with HIV is necessary to increase the likelihood of equitable implementation. The current study explores systemic inequities influencing HIV care adherence and retention, and approaches to address these challenges. We conducted semi-structured interviews with 13 clinics and 4 constituent groups: prescribing clinicians, non-prescribing clinical team members (e.g., medical case managers), clinic administrators, and policymakers. Through reflexive thematic analysis within a constructionist paradigm, we identified two key themes. The first elucidated experiences of systemic inequities such as access to resources, healthcare system navigation difficulties, power differentials, medical mistrust, intersectional stigma and potential patient burden associated with MAPS+. The second theme highlighted the ways in which staff and clinicians shoulder the burden of addressing inequities by approaching people with HIV with dignity and developing trusting relationships and how MAPS + can bolster this approach by partnering with and centering patient needs. While these individual and organizational efforts are valuable, ending the HIV epidemic requires structural changes to address systemic inequities directly. This research underscores the complex interplay between structural oppression and HIV care, calling for comprehensive approaches to achieve health equity.",Brady KA,Division of HIV Health,asanch49@gmu.edu.

Through experiential learning, medical trainees become healthcare professionals within this community. The COVID-19 pandemic disrupted traditional training models, requiring residents to adapt under extraordinary circumstances. This study applies a CoP lens to explore how residency program directors (PD) perceived residents' learning, competence development, and adaptation during the pandemic. A qualitative analysis was conducted on PD's written responses to a COVID-19 survey administered by the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education-International from July 1 to September 30, 2020. De-identified narrative reflections on the pandemic's impact on clinical learning environments and training experiences were analyzed using thematic content analysis. Responses from 138 PDs in six countries were analyzed. Three themes emerged, highlighting the social and dynamic nature of experiential learning in a CoP: (1) capability building, where residents adapted by integrating and applying knowledge, skills, and attitudes as modeled by faculty and peers; (2) fostering resilience in the face of uncertainty through altruism, volunteerism, strong support networks, and collective moral resilience; and (3) collaborative working and communicating across interdisciplinary and interprofessional teams, facilitated by a flattening of traditional hierarchies. Support from senior physicians and a shared sense of purpose facilitated residents' learning in a rapidly changing, high stakes environment. This accelerated experiential learning occurred through engagement within a CoP. Our findings illustrate how the CoP framework can help residency programs foster adaptive learning and resilience during future large-scale disruptions to medical training.",Lewis L; Ibrahim H,Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education-International,jolene_oon@nuhs.edu.sg.

Contingency management (CM) is the most effective intervention for stimulant use disorder and may engage non-treatment-seeking populations, especially when delivered by peer recovery support specialists (peers). We describe development and training for a novel peer-delivered CM program for stimulant use harm reduction and treatment engagement. We used a community based participatory research (CBPR) process to develop a CM program focused on self-identified goals for harm reduction and treatment engagement. A steering committee of peers guided study design, CM rewards, schedule, and incentivized goals. Peers completed coaching-to-criterion of six CM skills based on the CM Competence Scale (CMCS), then completed a one-on-one roleplay with a standardized patient. Coaches rated peer performance of each CMCS skill according to its Likert scale (1 = Very Poor to 7 = Excellent) and an a priori rating criterion of 4 ('adequate'). Roleplays included feedback and a 'replay' of skills, if necessary. The steering committee devised two CM interventions: an enhanced standard-of-care incentivizing peer visits ($20 for weekly peer visits) and an intervention that additionally incentivized self-directed goals ($20 for weekly peer visits and $30 for completed goal-related activities). Self-identified goal-related activities were chosen through a collaborative process and organized into 6 domains: (1) overdose/overamping prevention (2) substance use supports/treatment (3) daily living/housing (4) education/employment (5) mental/physical/spiritual health (6) social relationships. Forty-seven peers across nine peer-led organizations (three rural and six urban organizations across Oregon) completed CM training. All 47 peers met the a priori criterion in their roleplay, with seventeen (36%) requiring a 'replay' of a skill. Mean CMSC summary scores were 28.51 (SD 4.73) on the first attempt and 29.62 (SD 4.01) on the second attempt. PEER-CM (Peers Expanding Engagement in Stimulant Harm Reduction with Contingency Management) is among the first trials to use peer-delivered CM for stimulant use, incentivizing peer engagement and self-identified goals for harm reduction and treatment engagement. A CBPR approach strengthened the study design by incorporating peer guidance.

One way of assessment is to use a tool with bereaved family members after death. The aim of this study was to translate and cross-culturally adapt the International 'Care Of the Dying Evaluation' questionnaire (i-CODE) into Mandarin Chinese. Translation and cultural adaptation process was performed according to the Brislin Classical Backtranslation Model and the principles of the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) quality-of-life group translation procedure. Fifteen bereaved family members, 5 palliative care experts and 4 translators were involved in the process, which followed 10 steps: a) Preparation; b) Forward translation; c) Reconciliation; d) Backward translation; e) Reconciliation; f) Backward translation review; g) Expert consultation; h) Cognitive interview; i) Cognitive interview review; h) Final proofreading. The translation and cultural adaptation followed established guidelines. items 1 (""washing""), 2 (""giving medicines""), 14 (""noisy rattle""), 18 (""giving fluids through a 'drip'"") emerged divergence and reached a consensus among the research team, translators, and original author. In the cultural adaptation, demographic items were restructured to align with Chinese context. Gender-neutral terminology was employed by using ""they/them"". Inconsistent subject, terminology ""healthcare team"" and Items 4 (""had adequate privacy""), 14 (""noisy rattle""), 27 (""in the right place""), and 28 (""at the actual time of his/her death"") was modified based on experts' assessments and bereaved families' comments. Linguistic, cultural, and conceptual equivalence was achieved in the process of translation and cultural adaptation. A questionnaire allowing for international comparisons related to quality of care for dying individuals has been developed in Mandarin Chinese. Key cultural adaptations were required to ensure that the Chinese version of the i-CODE was suitable for use. It has proved content and face validity. Future work will focus on psychometric testing assessing the validity and reliability of questionnaire and its use in assessing and improving care.",,,zheng.xuejiao.r8@dc.tohoku.ac.jp.

However, challenges in translating MSC-based therapies to clinical applications necessitate standardized protocols following Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) guidelines. This study aimed at developing GMP-complained protocols for FPMSCs isolation and manipulation, necessary for translational research, by (1) optimize culture of MSCs derived from an infrapatellar fat pad (FPMSC) condition through animal-free media comparison and (2) establish feasibility of MSC isolation, manufacturing and storage under GMP-compliance (GMP-FPMSC). FPMSCs from three different patients were isolated following established protocols and the efficacy of two animal component-free media formulations in the culturing media were evaluated. The impact of different media formulations on cell proliferation, purity, and potency of MSCs was evaluated through doubling time, colony forming unit assay, and percentage of MSCs, respectively. Furthermore, the isolation and expansion of GMP-FPMSCs from four additional donors were optimized and characterized at each stage according to GMP requirements. Viability and sterility were checked using Trypan Blue and Bact/Alert, respectively, while purity and identity were confirmed using Endotoxin, Mycoplasma assays, and Flow Cytometry. The study also included stability assessments post-thaw and viability assessment to determine the shelf-life of the final GMP-FPMSC product. Statistical analyses were conducted using one-way ANOVA with Tukey's Multiple Comparisons. The study demonstrated that FPMSCs exhibited enhanced proliferation rates when cultured in MSC-Brew GMP Medium compared to standard MSC media. Cells cultured in this media showed lower doubling times across passages, indicating increased proliferation. Additionally, higher colony formation in FPMSCs cultured in MSC-Brew GMP Medium were observed, supporting enhanced potency. Data from our GMP validation, including cells from 4 different donors, showed post-thaw GMP-FPMSC maintained stem cell marker expression and all the specifications required for product release, including > 95% viability (> 70% is required) and sterility, even after extended storage (up to 180 days), demonstrating the reproducibility and potential of GMP-FPMSCs for clinical use as well as the robustness of the isolation and storage protocols. The study underscores the feasibility of FPMSCs for clinical uses under GMP conditions and emphasizes the importance of optimized culture protocols to improve cell proliferation and potency in MSC-based therapies.",,,ftaraballi2@houstonmethodist.org.

40329205,AI-assisted ophthalmic imaging for early detection of neurodegenerative diseases.,,International journal of emergency medicine,10.1186/s12245-025-00870-y,"Artificial intelligence (AI) plays a promising role in ophthalmic imaging by providing innovative, non-invasive tools for the early detection of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD). Since early diagnosis is crucial for slowing disease progression and improving patient outcomes, leveraging AI-assisted ophthalmic imaging retinal imaging can enhance detection accuracy and clinical decision-making. This review examines clinical applications of AI in identifying retinal biomarkers associated with neurodegenerative diseases. Relevant data was gathered through a comprehensive literature review using PubMed, ScienceDirect, and Google Scholar to evaluate studies utilizing AI algorithms for retinal imaging analysis, focusing on diagnostic performance, sensitivity, specificity, and clinical relevance. AI-assisted ophthalmic imaging retinal imaging enhances the early identification of neurodegenerative diseases by detecting microscopic structural and vascular changes in the retina. Studies have demonstrated that AI models analyzing Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) and fundus images achieve high diagnostic accuracy. Studies have reported an area under the curve (AUC) of up to 0.918 in PD detection, with sensitivity ranging from 80 to 100% and specificity up to 85%. Similarly, AI-assisted OCT angiography (OCT-A) analysis has successfully identified retinal vascular alterations in AD patients, correlating with cognitive decline and an AUC of 0.73-0.91. These findings highlight AI's potential to detect preclinical disease stages before significant neurological symptoms manifest. The integration of AI technologies into ophthalmic imaging holds the potential to improve early diagnosis and transform patient outcomes. However, challenges such as model interpretability, dataset biases, and ethical considerations must be addressed to ensure the responsible integration of AI into clinical practice. Future research should focus on refining AI algorithms, integrating multimodal imaging techniques, and developing predictive biomarkers to optimize early intervention strategies for neurodegenerative diseases.

Few studies have evaluated the prevalence and consequences of PIM use among older adults living in RCHEs. The objectives of this study are (1) to evaluate the prevalence of PIM use in 29 RCHEs in Hong Kong, and (2) to investigate the association between PIM use and hospitalization in this population. This is a prospective, observational, cohort study which utilized final-administered medication data from RCHEs that participated in a medication management program. Data on the medications administered to all residents living in the participating RCHEs were extracted from the SafeMed Medication Management System (SMMS We included 6,346 residents (age 82.9 ± 8.6 years; female 61.9%). The average number of current medications was 6.8 ± 7.4. Over half (51.5%) of residents had polypharmacy (≥ 5 medications). The 12-month period prevalence of PIM use was 34.5%.

Furthermore, evidence suggests that the development of comorbidities, including psoriatic arthritis, a key comorbidity causing irreversible damage, can be prevented or delayed in a subgroup of patients with psoriasis receiving these therapies. This implies that psoriasis treatments may alter the underlying disease mechanisms in some individuals, extending beyond their direct pharmacological effects. However, this concept of disease modification remains controversial, as predicting the natural clinical course of an individual patient with psoriasis is challenging, and typically, no permanent clinically detectable changes occur in psoriatic skin inflammation.

In critically ill patients in an intensive-care unit, where the prevalence of invasive fungal infection is lower, the high negative predictive value of BDG facilitates withholding or discontinuation of empirical antifungal therapy, contributing to antifungal stewardship. However, for the results of BDG testing to impact patient management, they need to be available within a clinically useful timeframe.The South West London Pathology (SWLP) network routinely sent samples for BDG testing from hospital trusts in our area to the UK Health Security Agency Mycology Reference Laboratory (MRL) at Bristol for analysis. In 2021, the mean turnaround time (TAT) was more than two times the 5-working-days standard stated in the SWLP user handbook. In this quality improvement project (QIP), we identified that the greatest delay was the MRL posting hardcopy reports. We investigated electronic reporting, first for all patient samples, and then only for intensive-care patients. However, we found that information technology (IT) and staffing limitations meant this was not viable.We then investigated commercial solutions and identified an innovative assay, which enabled the implementation of in-house BDG testing that was a good fit with our available staffing resource and laboratory environment. Our aim was to achieve at least 90% of BDG results authorised within 5 working days of sample receipt. Our QIP improved performance on this from 0.88% to 92.8% and reduced the mean TAT from 11.6 to 2.5 days and at lower unit cost.

We reviewed English-language published documents discussing AMS implementation or assessment at HCFs globally and in Asia. Themes were derived through content analysis and classified following the predefined context dimensions to develop assessment stems, defined as containing one identified determinant that may influence implementation outcomes. The survey consisting of identified assessment stems was reviewed by 20 locally identified experts in Asia who rated the level of relevance of these stems in AMS implementation in the region.National leadership, training and technical support, and policy and guidance were the most commonly identified themes among 100 themes identified from 73 reviewed documents.

For binary outcomes in which relative effects are consistent across baseline risks while absolute effects are not, Core Grade users assess consistency in relative effects. For continuous outcomes, they assess consistency in the absolute effects. When planning for the possibility of inconsistent results across studies, systematic review authors using Core GRADE construct a priori hypotheses regarding population or intervention characteristics that may explain inconsistency. They then judge the magnitude of inconsistency by considering the extent to which point estimates differ and the degree to which confidence intervals overlap. Before making a decision on rating down, Core GRADE users will evaluate where individual study estimates lie in relation to the threshold of the certainty rating (minimal important difference or the null). Finally, they will test their subgroup hypothesis and if an effect proves credible will provide separate evidence summaries and rate certainty of evidence separately for each subgroup. When they find no credible subgroup effect, they will provide a single evidence summary, rating down for inconsistency if necessary.",De Beer H; Eachempati P; Vandvik PO; Hultcrantz M; Montori VM,Guide2Guidance; Division of Endocrinology; MAGIC Evidence Ecosystem Foundation; HTA Region Stockholm,guyatt@mcmaster.ca.

Preoperative identification of patients at risk for persistent pain and PPD remains a challenge due to poorly understood underlying mechanisms. To better understand these potential mechanisms, here, we examined the preoperative cerebrospinal (CSF) proteome for changes associated with persistent pain or PPD at 3 months post-CD. Eighty patients undergoing elective CD under neuraxial anesthesia were recruited. We collected baseline demographics, obstetric data, and Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) scores. EPDS and pain scores were also obtained at 3 months post-CD. CSF was collected before spinal anesthetic placement. Liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry was used to study the CSF proteome. 63 patients completed clinical follow-up, however only 61 of the patients had adequate preoperative CSF sample for analysis. Of these 61 patients, 21 developed pain or PPD at 3 months post-CD (14 had persistent pain alone and 7 had PPD alone). Over 1600 proteins were quantified in each CSF sample. Forty-three of these proteins were nominally differentially expressed in patients with persistent pain and/or PPD vs those with neither disorder. Pathway analysis showed a downregulation of the complement and coagulation cascades in the preoperative CSF of patients who later developed persistent pain or PPD 3 months after CD. These results suggest that the CSF complement and coagulation cascades may play a role in patients who develop postpartum pain or PPD 3 months later.",,,mary.yurashevich@duke.edu.

Studies were included if they reported the association between ethnicity and RT use in adult mental health emergency settings. Searches were conducted across six databases and in grey sources and references until 15 April 2024. A narrative synthesis was performed and, in addition, a random-effects model was used for meta-analysis, with odds ratio as the measure. Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) was applied to evaluate the overall certainty of evidence. Potential explanations for RT use in relation to ethnicity were also synthesised narratively. Five studies from Norway (n = 1), Spain (n = 1) and the United States (n = 3) were included (14,777 individuals). Multiple classifications of ethnicity were used, with White, non-Hispanic and native-born serving as the ethnic majority group compared to ethnic minority counterparts. Overall, ethnic minorities in adult mental health emergency settings were non-statistically more likely to receive RT than ethnic majority populations. The overall certainty of evidence was deemed as low according to GRADE. While RT use was not statistically significantly higher among ethnic minorities overall, Black individuals, as a specific ethnic group, had significantly increased odds of experiencing RT compared to ethnic majority populations.

Among EGFR-TKIs, third-generation agents such as osimertinib have shown marked efficacy and favorable safety profiles and have become the standard of care in the first-line setting. The combination of osimertinib with platinum-based chemotherapy has recently been shown to improve PFS compared with osimertinib monotherapy in the FLAURA2 trial. Similarly, the MARIPOSA trial demonstrated clinical benefit of the combination of the EGFR-MET bispecific antibody, amivantamab, with the third-generation EGFR-TKI, lazertinib, further supporting the use of combination therapies as first-line treatment for EGFR-mutated NSCLC. Despite these advances, however, challenges such as brain metastases remain substantial barriers to successful treatment outcomes. Management of patients with such metastases often requires a multidisciplinary approach that integrates systemic treatment with local interventions such as radiation therapy. Finally, circulating tumor DNA has emerged as a promising biomarker for real-time monitoring of treatment response and evolution of drug resistance mechanisms. Analysis of such biomarkers can facilitate dynamic and personalized therapeutic adjustments, potentially improving outcomes. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the latest clinical evidence supporting therapeutic advances in the management of EGFR-mutated NSCLC, emphasizing the importance of tailoring treatment strategies based on tumor biology, patient-specific factors, and evolving therapeutic options.",,,hidet31@med.kindai.ac.jp.
